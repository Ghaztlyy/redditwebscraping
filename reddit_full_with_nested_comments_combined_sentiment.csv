This is so crazy to me because I played Microprose games growing up. My mom bought me Falcon 4.0 when I was 11 or 12 and I read that if you learned the game you could fly a real F-16. That was so motivating to a kid who normally can't access ""the real world"" yet. To see the Microprose logo on my own game feels a bit unreal.

But yeah seriously, thank you.

Pocketpair said in [**its response to the lawsuit**, external](https://www.pocketpair.jp/news/news16) on Thursday it would begin taking action on and investigating The Pokémon Company's claims.

But it added that it was ""unaware"" of the specific patents that it had been accused of infringing.

""We have not been notified of such details,"" it said.""

\[[Source: BBC](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c89lx7xdwd5o)\]

I'd be interested in knowing the speciifc patents are in question.

Having a look at TPC's patents, I believe the most likely ones are:

""In a first mode, an aiming direction in a virtual space is determined based on a second operation input, and a player character is caused to launch, in the aiming direction, an item that affects a field character disposed on a field in the virtual space, based on a third operation input. In a second mode, the aiming direction is determined, based on the second operation input, and the player character is caused to launch, in the aiming direction, a fighting character that fights, based on the third operation input.""

and

""In an example of a game program, a ground boarding target object or an air boarding target object is selected by a selection operation, and a player character is caused to board the selected boarding target object. If the player character aboard the air boarding target object moves toward the ground, the player character is automatically changed to the state where the player character is aboard the ground boarding target object, and brought into the state where the player character can move on the ground.""

[\[Source\]](https://patents.justia.com/assignee/the-pokemon-company)

Essentially the 3D capture/Fighting mechanic and the switching between Aerial and Ground mounts. If I'm correct in which patents I think are the subject of the lawsuit, they seem to have been filed after Palworld was released, but I'm unsure of how the system works from a retroactive perspective.

They've been doing amazing things for preservation, with real historians applying professional academic rigor to the work. Beyond that, they've pretty much finished a several-years effort of digitizing games magazines and are now working on a platform to create a library for public access (I am so excited for this). [This is their video previewing their library](https://youtu.be/WUaUXAE1nTM)

They also have a podcast which is SUPER fascinating, bringing in all the niche specialists independently studying and curating video game history for their insights.  They've collaborated with several studios to help preserve behind-the-scenes materials. Buying their duplicate blind boxes of donated gaming mags makes supporting their efforts uniquely rewarding. It's just a really great thing they're doing and I am crazy jealous of anyone who has the skills and good fortune to work there.

The only thing I will say is that changing the tech for us does not change the fact that we always will be ambitious,"" he said. ""And the next game we do will not be smaller, and it will not be worse.

One of the few other tidbits of already-public information is that CD Projekt Red has moved away from its own bespoke, internal REDengine to the more widely-adopted Unreal, which is owned by Epic Games. - ""The first thing I want to say again, to be sure, 100 percent clear, is that the whole team, myself included, are extremely proud of the engine we built for Cyberpunk. So it is not about, 'This is so bad that we need to switch' and, you know, 'Kill me now' - that is not true. That is not true, and this is not why the decision was made to switch.""   
  
""The way we built stuff in the past was very one-sided, like one project at a time. We pushed the limit - but also we saw that if we wanted to have a multi-project at the same time, building in parallel, sharing technology together, it is not easy.

More more importantly, you need to actually take a look at the credits of the games Sam Lake has worked on. Yes, games are a collaborative effort (well, big games are), but like it or not Kojima simply has far more of his own fingerprints on his games than Lake does. And finally, people are going to talk about Kojima more for the simple fact of having popularized an entire genre, having a career now spanning 35 years, and generally being an eccentric weirdo.

comment,1ebteam,lev8gvh,t3_1ebteam,gaming,"I know the state of AI in video games, I'm currently working on a game for Square Enix Japan.

This article is misleading, go figure. The skin wasn't an ""AI skin"". AI is not at the level where it can generate an entire AAA quality custom 3d character model and provide seamless texture maps, then rig it with no input. That's a pretty big insult to the modeller, surfacing artist and rigger that probably spent weeks working on the character. 
Furthermore the article goes on to blame AI for the job losses in the game industry recently, which is also false. 
The current slump in the games (and animation industry as a whole) is partially AI related in some departments, but is mostly caused by over hiring during COVID, ripples down the pipeline from the writers strike, and general worldwide inflation.

comment,1h7dg02,m0kmwif,t3_1h7dg02,pcgaming,"He is describing the need to calculate light differently.

Computers, for the most part, record light in a roughly *perceptual* model called gamma-compressed sRGB.

This is different from a *physical* model, which would record light in terms of intensity of light. This model is typically linear (as opposed to compressed) RGB.

This was done because humans perceive light on a logarithmic scale. Essentially, 2x the brightness to our eyes takes way more than 2x the photons. Having limited disk size, mapping it to our eyes rather than to photons means the values from 0 to 255 give us way more bang for buck.

When Half-Life 2 came out, the industry had begun to recognize the need for HDR, and this meant rendering in linear RGB to an off-screen buffer and then converting to gamma-compressed sRGB before hitting the screen, applying temporal tone mapping to simulate HDR on a non-HDR screen.

At the same time we finally cleaned up the error that we were blending *compressed* values rather than *linear* values whenever two colors needed to be combined mathematically (for lighting, pixel shaders, etc.). This meant that the gradient and falloff of light became physically correct. HDR enabled a level of realism in games that largely had been ignored.

Suddenly, video cards needed to update their entire pipeline: they were built for the incorrect gamma-compressed rendering. Now they needed to support multiple color space encodings like 10-bit or 16-bit floating point components. The entire pipeline to support HDR demanded way more GPU memory bandwidth and a rebalance of execution unit capability.

These days we can pass the linear RGB (or a linear YUV transform) almost directly to a monitor. We still need to tone map it as every monitor's contrast range is different, but it is what enables our screens to show true eye-piercing HDR brights.",1746,,1733421455.0,Neutral,0.644,neutral,0.928,0.0,1,0.0,-0.528,Overall Negative

(this is actually a side quest in Andromeda and I think it's around the point when I just gave up on the game). There's just been no change whatsoever since Andromeda, this is Bioware's standard now, not just in terms of quality, but in terms of artistic direction.

comment,1cdzirz,l1feiui,t3_1cdzirz,pcgaming,">As I rotated the two very different-looking games in my mind, cubelike, their similarities crystallized. In hindsight, Magicka's DNA is visibly threaded across everything Arrowhead's made. Mid-combat key combos to combine elemental magic would evolve into the ordinance input sequences in Helldivers, producing the same slapstick carnage. Magicka's farcical fantasy was a premonition of the Helldivers sci-fi satire. And when Arrowhead drifted from the Magicka model, it was still improving its art of gratuitous multiplayer action in the firefights of Showdown Effect and co-op dungeon crawling in Gauntlet.

This is hilarious bad writing…",516,,1714174386.0,Neutral,0.678,disgust,0.521,0.0,1,0.0,0.21375,Overall Neutral
comment,1cdzirz,l1h33v5,t3_1cdzirz,pcgaming,"No, they are getting it completely wrong.

As someone that worked in game industry for most of my life, let me give you my perspective - quite obvious why Helldivers and Baldurs Gate are such hits and why other are not.

In the olden days game companies would develop first game with a rookie team, then next similar game with team that is getting much better, then next similar game with expert team that already learned every mistake this kind of game can have - and that third game would be a mega hit. This is why Blizzard had such fantastic games, this is why Bioware had such fantastic games...etc

Today it goes a bit differently. Game company hires a team for a game, they develop a game, game company fires the entire team so they don't have to pay them while they are between games, when they develop next game they hire completely new rookie team...and it goes like that. Every new game is made by people that start learning process from scratch.

But lets look at Larian. Divinity games, then Divinity Original SIn 1 -> Divinity original Sin 2 -> Baldurs gate  
Same team polishing the formula to perfection.

Or Arrowhead that for all their existence worked on perfecting CO-OP formula: Magicka -> Helldivers -> Helldivers 2

The message is clear.

Studios stop firing then re-hiring people. What you doing is idiotic, and the results show",150,,1714205471.0,Neutral,0.463,neutral,0.483,0.0,1,0.0,0.21375,Overall Neutral

post,1hmknwg,,,pcgaming,"The 23 steps of purchasing my kid a Sony PC game on Steam for Christmas Back in my day (yep), you got a game for Christmas, you opened the box, you installed it from the physical media in the box, and you played it. 3 steps, roughly, if my counting fingers are still good in my advancing years.

In 2024, you get a PC game for Christmas, and this is what happens:

1. Santa purchases a digital license for a game.
2. Child receives game and installs it. Parent leaves, thinking child will be happy with their new game.
3. Child opens the game, is greeted with a message that they need a Sony account (in addition to their age-appropriate Steam account, which is in addition to their age-appropriate Google account needed to have an email address and their age-appropriate Microsoft account to have access to Windows).
4. Child calls for parent that they need a Sony account.
5. Parent clicks through ""child account creation"" page, which requires an adult account to provision.
6. Parent forgets their adult Sony login information (we're on a PC, not a PS5), has to look up their credentials, which are locked behind MFA on their phone.
7. Parent must satisfy Sony MFA via emailed auth code.
8. Parent signs in -- must re-auth email for the adult account (despite MFA already using said email).
9. Parent signs up for child account.
10. Parent must verify child email by signing into child Gmail account.
11. Parent must provide payment info to demonstrate that they are an adult. $0.50 must be charged to their adult-shaped credit card.
12. Parent enters credit card info.
13. Parent agrees to the $0.50 transaction using newly added credit card.
14. Unknown Error
15. Parent agrees to $0.50 transaction.
16. Unknown Error
17. Parent uses semi-child-appropriate curse word (""for crap's sake"") signs out of adult account, signs back in, finds where to create a child account, goes back through child account creation, agrees to $0.50 transaction. Success.
18. Parent must specify child account settings (age limits, etc). 1 or 2 EULAs here.
19. Parent goes back to game, signs in as child with new child account.
20. Parent must verify email account with MFA token sent to child account email.
21. Error
22. Retry. Probably another EULA. Success.
23. Child plays game

Literally, this is the process I went through to get Lego Horizon Adventures working on my kids PC via Steam. It was INSANE. I've been gaming my whole life and the way things have gone is just so depressing and so dystopian. It's a goddamn video game. I felt like I was trying to get a car loan!

Obviously the answer here is ""just sign up as an adult"" or better ""don't buy Sony PC games,"" but this is the ""proper"" method that Sony wants their PC customers to follow. It's *unhinged*. I'm not the type of person to pick a specific game launcher or bandwagon hate on whatever is the hot topic to hate at the moment, but boy howdy did this experience make it plain to me how godawful things have gotten.

Ac origins released yeeears ago, there is no way ubi can fix this fast since it's a big problem to solve and the game is old. I doubt their priority is to fix this instead of holiday vacation and that's normal. Just revert back the update or maybe even wait for a new windows update at this point.

comment,1g61arh,lsi1oxf,t3_1g61arh,pcgaming,"I installed yesterday for the first time to see how things are going (original Kickstarter backer).

Character creation is kind of cool, but nowhere as involved as most RPG games these days.

Choose to do the tutorial, got up out of bed was told to eat some food and drink water. Did it in the wrong order, water bottle is empty and no longer have a drink option, sink in the room can't be interacted with. Now stuck with a quest marker on myself telling me to dink water. Tried throwing bottle, it clipped thought he floor. Guess I soft locked the tutorial quest on the first step, impressive.

Aimlessly walked around unable to unlock my door, presumably because the tutorial still wants me to drink water. Found the quest log and abandoned the tutorial quest. Marker is gone but still locked inside my room.

Choose to force respawn. Woke up in med bay and able to walk out into the station yay. Instantly annoyed at the default slow RP walk, so sprinting everywhere seems to be the way to go. Got lost trying to find the dock. Found the info menu though, and turns out I don't have a ship actually. Guess I need to rent one? Tried to exit to menu in case the tutorial mode is an isolated instance and the game just crashed to desktop 10/10.

\[Edit:\] So fired up the game again this morning to give it another go, aaand there is a 44 Gb update. Ok installed that, aaand the character I created no longer exist, had to do character creation again. Ok no big deal didn't accomplish anything. Game takes forever to load, but ok I'm in aaand I can't get out of bed. Literally stuck there, see in chat that others have the same problem... After mashing F for like 5 minutes the get out of bed animation randomly played, aaand I'm stuck inside the wall. Tried exiting out and entering with no tutorial, literally failed to load. I guess the servers are overloaded since it's the weekend? Literally unplayable at the moment at least. Really not putting it's best foot forward so far that's for sure.

Every interaction between the companions feels like HR is in the room, and every interaction led by the main character Rook sounds like he's addressing an under-12 soccer team before a semi-final or teaching toddlers to properly share toys.""

Any dev who is paying attention knows. **What keeps you safe is being independent.** Once you are owned, you can be sold, and it's a matter of time until you're sold under a company that doesn't know and doesn't care and needs to make a 60% headcount cut.  Matter of time.

The NPC AI is such a bog on the CPU that if I'm around more than like 5 of them, the framerate takes a noticeable dip. Towns hover around 30-40 fps regardless of settings because of this. Additionally, whenever I walk up to one of the traders or tech in the first town, the fps just takes an absolute shit. No clue what that's about.


At the very least, stuttering hasn't been an issue so far, which might as well be a miracle for an Unreal Engine game at this point.

I agree when he says “They don’t want to be bamboozled— they just want to know what you’re making and why you’re making it and who it’s for.”  That’s still a job for marketing, it just needs to be targeted.  I think most people are sick of having ads jammed in their faces for games they’d never play (especially if those games turn out to be underwhelming or underdeveloped), but I’d argue there is still a place for targeted communication where players receive notice of new games based on their interests, prior gaming experience, etc.  A data driven marketer would answer all of those questions and communicate them to the right audience.  That said, the product needs to be of quality too— marketing can’t save a bad game, nor should it try.",746,,1714217880.0,Negative,0.623,neutral,0.899,-0.623,1,-0.623,-0.4937500000000001,Overall Negative

> 
> This initiative was created to make games live forever and once again bring the utmost attention to what the center of our work has been for the last 16 years: video game preservation.
> 
> We begin with the re-release of 100 classic games from our catalog with updated, improved, or quality-tested builds, including masterpieces like Heroes of Might and Magic® 3, Resident Evil, and Diablo+Hellfire.
> 
> One of our core missions from the very beginning was to preserve video games. For over a decade and a half, this mission has been our driving force. However, 2024 has made it clearer than ever just how vital this initiative is—and how crucial our role is in its continuation, as shown by the restoration of Alpha Protocol and the original Resident Evil trilogy.
> 
> Moreover, The Video Game History Foundation has recently shared that 87% of games created before 2010 are inaccessible today. This is something that we cannot accept, and with the help of the gaming community, we are set on getting that number down to zero.
> 
> The GOG Preservation Program is how we’ll achieve that. The GOG store identifies games that are part of the Preservation Program with a dedicated stamp. This stamp ensures that those games will run on your PC hassle-free, and you can enjoy them just as much as you did the first time you played them. 
> 
> These are not empty words – you can understand GOG's work on each game by looking at its Preservation Log.
> 
> Expect more and more games to join the GOG Preservation Program, both from our existing catalog and new classic additions.
> 
> We’ve made great efforts to make it happen, and we truly believe that with the Program, we can fight the dire situation of video games becoming inaccessible and keep them alive forever.
> 
> Your opinion and feedback are invaluable to us. So please share your thoughts.
> 
> And lastly – thank you; your support and love for games make everything possible.

comment,1hlkrlh,m3mznar,t3_1hlkrlh,pcgaming,"If you can't access the article (ad-block), here's a summarized tl;dr version:

>The prospect of Disney's Toontown Online impending shutdown was nothing short of devastating for the thousands of kids who had spent nearly a decade of their lives in this digital world made just for them. With less than a month before their beloved online world would be shut down, teens like Joey Ziolkowski set out on a seemingly impossible rescue mission: to save Toontown by re-creating it on their own private servers—without the permission of Disney.

>Today, Toontown Rewritten has more than 2 million registered users, with an average of 50,000 monthly users and 10,000 daily users. The Toontown Rewritten team knows they operate in murky waters. Without a licensing agreement from Disney, 11 years of hard work could be shut down at any minute by a Disney lawyer. That’s why they’ve taken extensive steps to try to circumvent any concerns the Mouse House would have, including founding a nonprofit organization to oversee the game; making the game free to play; forgoing advertising revenue; and removing NPCs of Disney characters like Mickey, Minnie, Goofy, and Donald Duck.

>These volunteers aren’t just donating their time, either. Toons of the World, the nonprofit behind Toontown Rewritten, is funded entirely through volunteer donations. Server costs alone for TTR amounted to nearly $17,000 in 2023, according to tax filings.  


>**How the developers got the Walt Disney Company to approve such a game, however, was thanks to some clever maneuvering.** As Schell tells it, *Toontown*’s bad guys were originally going to be evil businessmen, or the “Suits.” Production was chugging along until Roy Disney Jr., the nephew of Walt Disney and son of longtime chief executive Roy O. Disney, came by for a tour at the Imagineering studio and got a preview of the game. The businessman was not pleased.

>The next day, Schell’s team received a memo expressing as such. So how to placate the businessman without losing the game’s anti-corporate ethos? “We wrote back saying, ‘OK, we heard and understood. We will be changing it. The enemies will now be robots.’ We didn't mention that they were *business* robots,” Schell says. “It never came up again.”



>So in August 2013, 10 years after Toontown Online’s launch, Disney announced it would be pulling the plug. That brings us back to our group of high schoolers, who decided the game needed just as much saving from Disney as the cartoon world did from its Cogs. “The whole message of \[*Toontown*\] was ‘don't let the corporation grind you \[down\]...’ Schell says, “....I look at the *Toontown Rewritten* crowd, and what do they do? They're violating copyrights all over the place. Why? Because the corporation tore Toontown down.”

>By September 23, 2013—four days after Toontown Online went dark—Ziolkowski published a teaser video of pre-alpha, early gameplay for Toontown Rewritten. On September 1, 2017, TTR opened to the public. A team of roughly 130 volunteers dedicate themselves to keeping the game running and growing. ‘All of a sudden, this project, which had up until this point been just a ragtag bunch of misfits, needed some structure and some hierarchy and some backbone,’ said software engineer Sam Edwards.

>Whatever changes they do make, the TTR team’s emphasis is on keeping the artistic style and gameplay as close as possible to the spirit of the original. Meanwhile, veteran players return to the game to relive their childhoods, even if they now exist as real-world versions of the business Cogs they once fought against. It’s a classic Disney ending.",146,,1735069391.0,Negative,0.473,sadness,0.832,-0.473,1,-0.473,0.24525000000000002,Overall Neutral

Built my first PC for TF2. It’s disheartening to see what the game has become.

It's kinda sad to see a giant like TF2 go down like this. One thing is a game slowly dying due to time (has like 20 years now) or other games to play instead.

After 2 years of silence from Valve after the [last tweet from the Team Fortress twitter account](https://x.com/TeamFortress/status/1529970640224018433), TF2 players have decided to start a new campaign, #FixTF2, pleading with Valve to solve the game's rampant bot crisis.

Steam workshop support. Supports models, textures, maps, and campaigns (eg. Minerva, the only upload at the moment).

A whole bunch of bug fixes, including re-adding grass sprites, lighting and HDR fixes, new lightmaps (no more blocky flashlight), and many map-specific fixes.

Better controller and Deck support.

comment,1cf8ou9,l1noarn,t3_1cf8ou9,pcgaming,"While I'd love a remake that modernizes them, I'd be terrified that they'd remove some of the themes of the original games too. Like sure, the games had their jokes, their parodies, their references, but they were also DARK and DEPRESSING in a whole lot of ways. Like...

You can literally be a slaver in Fallout 2. Slaves exist, and you can join the slavers and capture some. 

Drug addiction is a big deal in Fallout 2. This newfangled drug, Jet, is literally ruining lives and turning people into a junkie. With modern Bethesda games, Jet is ""slow down time for 10 seconds and don't get addicted or you'll have to take an addictol lol"", but it was MUCH darker in Fallout 2.

There's rampant sexism. Play a female character and you'll have all sorts of demeaning language thrown your way. A few characters even say something like ""If you're not here to fuck me, Legs, then get out."" And you know what? With some of them, you can AGREE to fuck them in exchange for some benefit. A discount on a vital NPC you need to get from slavers. In another case you can trade sex for car upgrades (and then literally fuck the mechanic to death).

There's a shotgun wedding. You can fuck the daughter or son of a character in a small town, and this character will force you to marry the person at gunpoint.

You can *kill kids* (in the NA release anyway), and the NPCs around you will react to it in various ways. There's a karma trait linked to it.

These are just a handful of the major themes, ideas, situations that I'm afraid they'd remove because a ""modern audience wouldn't accept them"" or something like that. But they're also things that elevate Fallout 1 & 2 to being some of the greatest RPGs of all time, in my book, so I'd rather no remake than a remake that excluded that sort of stuff.",483,,1714320542.0,Negative,0.726,fear,0.473,-0.726,1,-0.726,-0.26475,Overall Neutral

post,1gj8qm3,,,pcgaming,"DA: The Veilguard held back by its bland and safe writing direction 
i tried playing it, and honestly those two cringe cut scenes are the least should be concerned of. The writing for the whole game just felt too safe, a big departure from previous DA. Even DA:I is not this safe.

The criticism ""feels like there's a HR in the room."" is absolutely legit and fair. Heck, even Varric manner of speech and behaviour are toned down. Most of cut scenes interaction felt like I'm watching conversations between corporate employees. There are moments some characters tried to be snarky, but it didn't deliver because it sounded like insults to jab at work colleagues.. which weird for a medieval fantasy. 

But, the character creation deserves respect, particularly face sliders. Super fun to mess around with. I spent hours on character creation menu.

Combat, well, it tried to be ME3 but ends up clunky because it combines DA:I action/strategy combat mechanics with ME3 fast-paced shooter feel. The dodging mech is particularly clunky if you're playing as a mage.

Backtracking on their insane policies at launch around used games and whatnot, then the backwards compatibility program, the One X launch and Gamepass.

But for all that good will he built, there has just been a massive failure to deliver compelling software. I look at Xbox over the past 10 years and you have to really ask, where are all the games?? In an entire generation, they launched a single Halo game that was pretty much universally disliked. The Series X launched in November 2020 and they've yet to even deliver a Gears of War, with the last one releasing at the tail end of 2019. Its kind of wild that Hi-Fi rush is considered their hit of the generation thus far, and then they can off the studio that made it.

Guy has some interesting ideas about where Xbox should go (some I think are good, some not), but the guy just fundamentally doesn't understand that games come first and foremost. Sure, I can play games on my phone or TV or whatever. That's great, but it's essentially useless if you don't have anything that I WANT to play. 7/10s don't cut it anymore. People don't have time to waste on them, ESPECIALLY when both of your main competitors are releasing damn near 10/10s on a regular basis. 

I also think he's too nice to a fault. Heads should have been rolling at 343 a long time ago. Halo infinite had the capability to take off due to battlefield 2042 and cod vanguard both flopping, they completely fumbled the bag. Gears has been dormant forever now. Who the hell knows when Fable is coming out, if it ever does. When's the last time you heard about the Rare game Everwild? Hellblade 2 is a 5 hour game that took 5 years of development? What the fuck are these studios doing? The development is far too lax, nobody is holding their asses to the fire. Yeah, crunch is bad but this is the inverse of crunch.

The Series S was a big mistake also IMO. Not enough memory and that is a serious limitation. Pair that with the boneheaded strategy that every game needs feature parity between S/X, and it's no wonder why devs are starting to abandon Xbox. Remember the self inflicted wound that happened where the Xbox version of BG3 was delayed because they couldn't get feature parity working on the Series S? 

That and the sales just aren't there, because people on Xbox have been trained to just wait for stuff to show up on game pass and not actually buy games. 

I mean, what is the last Xbox thing that has blown up into a huge success? Palworld, a game they had nothing to do with and is only an ""exclusive"" by sheer dumb luck?

Like saying it's not corporate greed while thinking laid off people can just hang out at the beach for a year... they have been looting the industry for so long that have straight created their own reality and don't even realise anymore.

This is the kind of people that rule over big companies, take decisions, and have a big impact on industries. People that know literally zero about any technicality or how things are done to make videogames in this case.

post,1d2pr04,,,leagueoflegends,"The Hall of Legends event was never about celebrating Faker, it was to use him to make money. Almost every League player loves Faker and we would have loved to to own the Ahri skin dedicated to him. Riot putting the full skin behind 600$ paywall is the biggest insult imaginable to us. Riot chose to exploit our love for Faker for their own gain. 

This was suppose to be something to remember Faker by, when he has retired and proof that we were here and cheering for him when he was still playing and lifted those Trophies. Faker never uses skin probably because he wanted to show the world that you don't need to be rich to be good at the game and be someone great.

Funny thing is, if the bundles were priced around 100$, then at least 6x players would been afford it and had bought it and Riot would have made the money anyways. But the greed at Riot is too short sighted to see that. Do not get FOMO from this.

""
G2 not only benched me at the end of 2021 during the 1st year of my 3 year contract, but they also made sure that under no circumstances would I go to another LEC team for egoistic reasons (financial / easier competition). 

KC saved me and also did everything they could to help me get back to LEC at the end of 2022 (removing buyout if I agreed to not receive half of my salary for that year). 

FNC then in turn decided to bench me after 4 months of my 2 year contract, trying to get me out after a few weeks already (failing to do so at an earlier time).

T1 saved me once again and is doing everything they can to not only support me during a continuous tough period of my life, but also help me as much as they can to make sure 2025 is a good situation for me.

The villains were / are within the region I ""abandoned"".

comment,1gtrlw4,lxow907,t3_1gtrlw4,leagueoflegends,"Arcane was always written to be two seasons. 

The confusion is because internally there was a budget conversation about “approving 5 seasons” - which simply means we were setting aside a bunch of money for lots of development and is completely irrelevant to the Arcane creative. The creative and making something great is what the priority should always be for Riot and our teams. 

We have also always envisioned telling more stories and continuing to expand the universe. That hasn’t ever changed - people just jump at rumors or misleading headlines and Riot didn’t correct them - but given those rumors gained momentum, happy to clarify. 

Just because that is our intent, doesn’t mean it’s easy or that we can pump these things out like a factory - just like making games that are worthy of players time / love is really hard, so too is telling great stories and making incredible shows / films (especially when we are building it from scratch for the first time).

That is always what Rioters are focused on (or should be focused on), no matter what 3rd party rumors say.

And since I’m here I’ll add - the “lol @ the cost” of Arcane arguments are silly from our perspective - as people have correctly pointed out the cost per minute of Arcane is about 1/3 to 1/4 of what Illumination / Pixar films cost. 

The market for this (“high quality adult focused animation”) didn’t exist before Arcane so Hollywood has a hard time getting their head around why we would do this.

I can think of plenty of other short shows where I feel like time is being wasted, but I genuinely was on the edge of my seat through every second of both seasons.


If they can consistently set this kind of bar, take as long as you need. Not everywhere in Runeterra has such emotive family storylines, so I really am curious how they will tackle other regions.",1564,,1732482992.0,Positive,0.774,sadness,0.548,0.774,1,0.774,0.65225,Overall Positive

comment,1gz1m6k,lytep20,t3_1gz1m6k,leagueoflegends,"The animation for Arcane set a whole new standard imo. The general look is immaculate, and then there's a 2min sequence every episode that is just pure art. While I'd not have minded seeing a more standard cartoon/anime style to tell League stories, what Fortiche did with Arcane is sublime and I'd not trade it in for more episodes of a faster release schedule. 

I know some are unhappy with pacing and the ending, I do think s2e9 could have been a 90min-er or just made an ep10 - I'm still happy with the conclusion. 

Its rare that I'll sit and just be totally encapsulated by a show, but Arcane had me hooked for all 18 episodes and will do on rewatches. I'm glad the show is getting it's flowers, good feedback will lead to more of these ambitious projects.",374,,1732488664.0,Positive,0.675,joy,0.889,0.675,1,0.675,0.65225,Overall Positive

post,1hbodzl,,,leagueoflegends,"The new Samira emote raises QC issues and questions on the use of AI for art  https://preview.redd.it/r3vrzzoka66e1.jpg?width=256&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=737be2ce83e41e6bec48adf2734d49e6a9df6720

There are multiple quality issues in regards to the new Samira emote, including:

* 6 fingers
* missing half of the lower lip
* Mismatched detailing on the collar
* Odd ear shading

While there's no certainty that this was made with generative AI, there is certainty that the quality control team dropped the ball with this one.

  
Edit: As I said, there's no confirmation that it was made with AI and it was pure speculation due to some mistakes that are consistent with usual AI issues.

  
LoLDev has released a sketch of it and denies the AI claim, they said that the emote will be fixed:

I rambled, I write to you know my beloved Jungler to inform you that the enemy team, those with the Nexsus opposite to ours on the Summoner's rift, recently utilized their summoner abilities. Despite us writing them out of the lore, it would see the ability persist in their absence and I would find it prudent to be aware of when you might be able to expect their return, should you happen to encounter the foul opponents during your escapades in the lane between lanes. Please see attached the collection of expected recovery time for their abilities. I sincerely hope you have a blessed game of League of Legends, and I eagerly await your expedient rotational direction towards our bottom lane.

With Love and Respect,

post,1gjg6x7,,,leagueoflegends,"With his 5th win, Faker will have more skins than 62 champions  Faker is on his way to 8th skin, and 9th as Prestige edition, after the 5th win this Worlds. He already has Championships Zed, Ryze, Ori, and Syndra. Plus Risen Legend LeBlanc, Risen Legend Ahri, and Immortalised Legend Ahri. With win at Worlds, he would have 8th skin plus he can do a Prestige Edition as 2024 MVP, which we can count as 9th. 

And there are actually [62 champions who have 8 or lower skins](https://wiki.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/List_of_skins_by_champion), so Faker will be quite high in skin’s ladder.

post,1gqcnf5,,,leagueoflegends,"Rekkles leaves T1/T1.A >Hey everyone,

>I have some important news to share with you about the next chapter of my journey.

>The biggest point of discussion—and what might come as a shock to you—is my decision to leave T1. Now, before everyone reacts, please give me a moment to explain. After hearing my story, I hope it will be easier to understand why.

>When I received the offer from Becker last year to come to Korea and try out for the LCK CL team, I was not in a great place mentally. I had recently been diagnosed as being on the autism spectrum, and combined with a family accident and a couple of tough years since leaving Fnatic in 2020, I was struggling. Because of this, I was actually leaning toward taking a break for the 2024 season. But since it was T1 asking, I knew future Martin would regret not giving it a try. I think we can all agree this was the right decision, but, as expected, it did not fix my issues—it just put them on hold. Now, I believe it is time for me to address those challenges, and to do that, I need to be in Sweden close to my family.

>Thankfully, I have been fortunate to receive an offer that allows me to continue playing professionally in the 2025 season from home. To put it in League of Legends terms, I am finally taking a “recall”—a chance to go back, refill my health and mana, buy some essential items and upgrade my skills before re-entering the map. I left home in 2013 when I was just 16, and now, nearly 12 years later at the age of 28, I get the chance to reset. I want to play for as long as possible, and when I imagine the years ahead, I realize this change could help make that goal achievable. Longevity is incredibly important to me at this stage of my career.

>I know this may feel like a surprising decision, especially after the high of winning Worlds together with ZOFGK + KTR. However I promised myself to stay committed to this plan, regardless of results or temporary emotions. This is me keeping that promise, and I hope you will understand that it comes from a place of wanting to stay in the game and continue improving.

>I will always be grateful for my time with T1, not just for the experience but for how it has helped me grow as a player and a person. Coming to Korea without experience in the role or knowing the language was a challenge, but T1 believed in me anyway. I want to thank my teammates, coaches and staff at T1 HQ for helping me along the way, and to all of our fans for supporting us. It has been an honor to wear the T1 badge.

>Thank you all for being here with me so far, and I hope you will join me for this next chapter as well. I could not do it without your support.

>다시 만나요!

post,1g020ub,,,leagueoflegends,"The League Wiki is Leaving Fandom TLDR: The wiki is leaving Fandom and becoming the official wiki for League in partnership with Riot and Weird Gloop. Find us on our new site: https://wiki.leagueoflegends.com

Hey everyone, on behalf of the editing team on the League wiki, I’m here to announce that we are **leaving Fandom** and launching the **OFFICIAL League of Legends Wiki**! We are doing this in partnership with our new hosts [Weird Gloop](https://weirdgloop.org/), the hosts of the Runescape and Minecraft wikis, and the full support of Riot, who are footing the bill for the server costs.

As many of you know (or have personally experienced), the excessive, shitty ads, pop-ups, and policies on Fandom have made the viewing experience awful and severely limit our ability to deliver our content and theme our wiki. The site is horribly slow and reading is especially painful for our many mobile readers. We’ve wanted to leave Fandom, but it’s possible now thanks to Riot.

Some fun examples of ads: https://youtube.com/clip/Ugkx3hDXNuBN_a7TtbYNPGPC2Paiv6XGbXVn

Riot approached us in early 2024 with the explicit idea of us becoming the official wiki and agreed to pay for our hosting. We ultimately chose to host the wiki on Weird Gloop and receive search engine optimization (SEO) help from them and Riot. We chose Weird Gloop because we have aligned views on making the most player friendly wiki possible and they have been fantastic partners in helping us on the backend.

You can find out more in Riot’s latest [blog post](https://www.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/news/announcements/the-official-league-of-legends-wiki/)!

We are going to continue to cover all content under the League Studio umbrella: the Runeterra IP/universe, League of Legends, Teamfight Tactics, Wild Rift, and Legends of Runeterra. All of our previous content will still be available and it will be the home of all new content as well like new champions, TFT sets, patches, skins, and more.

It will take some time for the new site to show up on search engines, so we highly recommend changing any old links to the new site and updating your bookmarks! You can also install the [Indie Wiki Buddy](https://getindie.wiki/) extension, which lets you ignore Fandom links altogether. The SEO battle won’t be won overnight, so we appreciate any help you give us. On behalf of the wiki team, we thank you all for the support over the years and we'll see you all on the new and improved, ***OFFICIAL*** [League of Legends Wiki](https://wiki.leagueoflegends.com)!

If you have any questions or feedback, feel free to chat with us on [discord](https://discord.gg/FBnJ8CH)

post,1gq4c12,,,leagueoflegends,"Teemo top is, legitimately, a degenerate gameplay pattern It's insane to see people whining about matchups they don't like playing against in different lanes, just to see what sticks. I swear: half the gameplay of League is lobbying Riot for buffs or nerfs with precision harping. Like, really. A tubby middle-aged alcoholic is insurmountable for you? Awww. 

For an actual, objective, concrete, serious 'degenerate gameplay pattern,' want to know one? Teemo. It's 1000% Teemo top. How crazy is it that the first time you enter lane, there's a chance he's already invisible and hiding in the brush? That the first you sense of him will not be the Yordle's visage, but the sound of his feet softly crunching in the grass, the rustle of underbrush passing over his smooth fur, or perhaps his pleasant scent of sunlight mingling with travel-dust and freshly baked scout biscuits? You know he's present and waiting for an opportunity to prick you with his devious blowgun, and there's nothing else for it but to sit there, breathing raggedly, until the Yordle decides to take his shot. 

There shouldn't be champions in the game that inflict such a degree of anticipation that I am having trouble starting at my computer screen. My palms start to sweat, and my vision swims as it darts between bush one, bush two, bush three. Which one? I'm guessing wildly. And he probably loves that. Oh, I bet he loves watching me crumble and panic. I think about what he must think of me--and my thoughts turn towards a place so dark and lost that a control ward's light would quickly be swallowed. Countless times I'll devolve into a quivering, directionless mess against him... his next victim, as he laughs and clenches his fingers around his toxic blowgun, ready to sap my strength and leave me helpless and at his mercy. 

But sure, Gragas, Nocturne, whoever else is toxic because they take advantage of convoluted mechanics or killed you early last game. Against Teemo, he dominates me without even pressing a button. Friendly reminder to not just say stuff to say stuff when it comes to game balance, because it adversely how the game grows over time.

comment,1dpqp19,lainyd7,t3_1dpqp19,leagueoflegends,"This revealing actually only got fixed for Lux E a little while (year or so) ago.

""Targeting"" enemy units with ``single-target``, ``area``, ``pointblankAOE``, or ``cone`` targeting type while the enemy team has no vision of you creates a reveal bubble on you at the start of the cast (when the engine-level targeting happens), unless the spell has this turned off with a parameter. 

The actual ""targeting area"" for area and cone spells is typically NOT what's actually used by the spell script afterwards; It's just a leftover of a type of targeting that they never fixed to even work with cast times (so before they were each changed to just do this at script level, cone spells like Darius E would ""find"" their targets on cast start, and then affect them at the end of the cast time - wherever they went).

Anyway, since this whole emerging reveals stuff is super obscure and controlled by spell data that isn't directly maintained or even controls anything besides the revealing* (\*new AI Bots might rely on this again too), that's why you get all these inconsistencies between spells and champions.

Ifyou ever wondered why Xerath W reveals you if an enemy was in the center circle specifically at the start of the cast, this is why.

post,1gs3rgw,,,leagueoflegends,"The toplaner ""TheBausffs"" of newly announced team Los Ratones  has been seen inting in soloq So, like many of you, I was hyped when famous canceller, Caedrel “Sally” Lamont, announced his new team, Los Ratones. The roster? Absolute banger: Nemesis, former FNC midlaner and Rekkles , literal recent world champion, plus some fresh blood like Velja and... uh... Thebausffs

Now, I’ll admit, I was cautiously optimistic. The team seemed like a fun mix: seasoned veterans, hungry rookies, and just enough chaos to make things interesting, the kind of lineup that could pull off a Cinderella story if everything clicked. Naturally, I was curious. I wanted to see what this “professional” side of TheBausffs looked like in action. So, like any rational person, I hopped onto his Twitch stream to get a sense of the guy Caedrel is putting his faith in. And what do I see?

Game 1: Kayn top. 0/11/0  
Okay, okay, everyone has a bad game. It happens, right?

Game 2: Irelia top. 2/14  
Uhm.. maybe he’s testing limits?

Game 3: Fiddlesticks toplane with aftershock*.* 1/12  
??????

I’m starting to think Caedrel picked him as part of a lost bet, or maybe Baus has some dirt on him. How else does a guy locking in Fiddlesticks top with Aftershock end up on a team with Rekkles and Nemesis? Then it clicked, he’s probably the mascot. He’s got the goofy, meme-worthy personality, and if you squint, he even kind of looks like a rat. But can you imagine the voice comms after he runs it down for the seventh time in scrims? “On me guys.”

The Global Times (环球时报), one of China Chinese Communist Party's flagship newspaper (often commenting on international issues from a Chinese nationalistic perspective), congratulated BLG Worlds 2024 win on Weibo (equivalent of Facebook in China) when the score was BLG 2-1 T1 and still halfway through Game 4.

In [this tweet ](https://x.com/JankosLoL/status/1807791680227008931)Jankos calls out IWillDominate, Gilius and ""some casters"" for misunderstanding how Sejuani E works, as he explains how his ultimate procs the extra damage off the stun. ""I basically played my mechanics pixel-perfect, but some frauds don't know that""

The tweet reads: ""Sejuani R procs her passive, I've also made a step backwards to proc the extra DMG from ult, as you wouldn't in melee range""

He also includes a clip of Gilius and IWillDominates liveview, where they say: ""Bro, why didn't he auto once? You saw his mechanics there? He's just a noob Sejuani or what? That's literally the difference between killing and not.""

Edit: IWDominate has since [admitted to his mistake](https://x.com/IWDominate/status/1807804451236859933), saying he was wrong and that Jankos has [played it optimally](https://x.com/IWDominate/status/1807811989047070805) in retrospect.

Nope. Doesn't matter. Mr. Warwick will huff and puff and blow down every champion during early game.

Then you're giving him two kills instead of one. Not very smart!

Wrong. He has *invaded* your jungle (past tense). Because if Warwick is next to your camp, it's already gone.

No, no you didn't. The turret did, and you're not the turret.

comment,1geqzg3,lubr7by,t3_1geqzg3,leagueoflegends,"I like this. Faker displays what more people need to realise - they are both incredible players and deserve all praises handed to them. Earlier this year, I thought it was impossible for Chovy to lose and to miss out on this opportunity. This time around, it just wasn't time despite the record showing season. 

The thing is that we're heading into football's dilemma with Messi/Ronaldo debates, where apparently it's impossible to like both players. For some reason, it needs to be a you vs. me-situation. We should all cherish that we have many incredible midlaners playing at this moment, instead of hating on those that lose. It happens, move on. 

I'm excited to see how the finals turn out and, while hoping for a Faker win, wouldn't mind Knight to get some recognition too (in the form of prizes).",885,,1730197281.0,Positive,0.48,neutral,0.441,0.48,1,0.48,0.673,Overall Positive

A single image from the scrim from today on what Bausen law is all about, Baus score is 1/7/1, Aurora score is 7/0/1, but Baus is the one with more gold in the entire game at that point, more cs, more plates taken and 0 bounty, Aurora has 550Gold that was eventually catched by Nemesis creating even more gold diff For Los Ratones.  


So yeah, this is what Bausen Law is all about.

comment,1f0u1y8,ljud3ui,t3_1f0u1y8,cs2,"* FMPONE is constantly sharing new [progress pictures of **Cache**](https://www.reddit.com/r/cs2/comments/1exnafm/fmpone_has_shared_new_progress_pictures_of_the/) for CS2. Once it is finished I am sure the devs will include it into the game. I think it will maybe take year to be finished and included.
* First mentions of a Valve-reworked version of **cobblestone** showed up in the game files a few months ago. Apparently, it will be winter-themed.
* **Train** for CS2 was shown off in the official dev wiki before CS2 even released. However, I think Valve are working on completely rebuilding it (like Overpass and Inferno).

I’m aware that a lot of people from both communities are generally in agreement valve needs to do something. I’ve seen a lot of mutual hatred for valve’s negligence on both subs, and a lot of discussion between the communities.

Should we make an official team up? Start making crossover art, review bomb both games, boycott valve, etc? Make some noise and get valve to do something?

3kliksphilips (one of the best and biggest CS YouTubers) has been very unlucky in the past: Most large Counter-Strike updates were released while he was on holiday.

This happened to the point where it has become a running gag that there’s a CS update while he’s on holiday.

“3kliksphilips can you go on holiday please?” has become synonymous with wanting a new CS update.

comment,1flprpb,lo565na,t3_1flprpb,cs2,"Personally, I think the title should be **""proof why aim isn't everything""**

CS2 is perhaps the most mechanically demanding game and esports out there

However, good aim only gets you so far. If you only have good aim, but bad movement, bad positioning, bad economic understanding, no grenade knowledge, etc.,

then you will:

* get pre-aimed because you are not moving and only standing in common angles
* get headshotted constantly because you aren't making yourself hard to hit
* be stuck on deagles because you are buying every round
* run in 1 after 1 into the enemies who are trading effectively
* get flashed
* get naded
* get mollied out of your position
* get smoked off
* etc.

 * Zugriff auf Einstellungen: Klicken Sie auf die Schaltfläche ""Einstellungen"", die normalerweise in der oberen rechten Ecke des Hauptmenüs befindet.

 * Navigieren Sie zu Sprachoptionen: Suchen Sie im Einstellungsmenü nach dem Abschnitt ""Sprache"". Es könnte unter einer allgemeineren Kategorie wie ""Benutzerinterface"" oder ""Allgemein"" sein.

 * Änderungen übernehmen: Bestätigen Sie Ihre Auswahl, indem Sie auf die Schaltfläche ""OK"" oder ""Übernehmen"" klicken (die genaue Wortwahl kann variieren).

 * Spiel neu starten: Counter-Strike 2 fordert Sie möglicherweise auf, das Spiel neu zu starten, damit die Sprachänderungen wirksam werden. Wenn nicht, können Sie das Spiel manuell beenden und neu starten.

comment,1gw5lfc,ly6vh33,t3_1gw5lfc,cs2,"I will get downvoted for saying this but hear me out.

**Sub-tick has more potential than 128-tick** 

It‘s already improved so much since it was implemented that it is getting close to overtaking 128-tick:

- The main problem with sub-tick was the inconsistent movement. This has FINALLY been fixed a month ago.

- Sub-tick will **always** give you the lowest possible delay when shooting. 128-tick can go just as low, but also higher and the delay will be dependent on whether or not you shoot just before or after the next tick. Sub-tick doesn‘t have this randomness.

- People were saying the game wasn‘t feeling crisp, but in reality it were the bad movement animations. They got updated and fixed a few months ago to match CS:GO‘s. 

- People were saying spraying sucked despite it being the exact same patterns as in CS:GO. This was because the visual feedback was missing in CS2. This was also fixed a few weeks ago when they added better decals and white spots where the last bullet hit.

- Now people (with bad internet) are blaming the connection on sub-tick. In reality, it is the movement animation system that takes too much bandwidth that affects people with no LAN / bad wifi. Valve already said they‘re working on it.

Be happy Valve is innovating. Sub-tick will be better in a few months if Valve keeps improving the game, servers and systems at this pace. It‘s already 10x better than on CS2‘s launch.",394,,1732157242.0,Positive,0.484,neutral,0.922,0.484,1,0.484,0.11324999999999999,Overall Neutral

post,1ft0uqz,,,dota2,"Playing Dota is the most disrespectful thing I do to myself This isn't a complaint or a brag thread, it's just some musings I had the other day.

I have a PhD. In my 9-5, I work with other PhDs, lawyers, and economists. Everyone has a law degree or Master's, minimum. We all treat each other with respect and work on complex legal and economic issues around the world.

In my daily life I have a loving, supportive, and brilliant partner. My friends give me hugs and (sometimes) kisses when they see me. All things considered (""all things"" being the state of the world in general), I am much better off than most, economically and socially and romantically.

And then I hop into Dota. I queue up, have to contend with my lane partner fighting for last hits or just AFKing in jungle, and then get called a ""fucking idiot"" or ""learn to look at minimap kid"", all while probably being old enough to be their dad.

Playing Dota is the dumbest, most disrespectful thing I can do for myself.

Considering how long Dota has been around and how old some of us might be, who else can relate?

Edit: small note here to say WOW. Didn't expect this level of engagement when I posted from the toilet. Impossible for me to respond to everything but I really enjoyed reading through all the responses. As with Dota, the types of people who love Dota enough to visit a forum and comment are as varied as you can imagine: lots of people who relate, the chill individuals who just want to mute-all and play, and then of course a small amount of individuals who misinterpreted or assumed things that were never said and went off. But just as I open myself up to being insulted everytime I launch Dota, so too did I expect that posting on apublic forum.

My writing maybe wasn't clean, and many of you understood my meaning, but it really was all about how playing Dota subjects us to very different environments than what we experience or subject ourselves to in our daily life. But ultimately, it's an absolutely brilliant game, regardless of our skill level or time investment or willingness to communicate with each other as we would face-to-face. I hope to still continue to enjoy it here and there over the years to come (whether playing or just watching the pro scene), and I hope you all do, too.

It's one of those games where you get excited about the prospect of having a good game and winning but forget that when you have a bad game it almost ruins your day; you feel like you wasted 9 other people's time or an hour of your own. You fight people because most people don't use voice chat and communicating effectively or at all with 4 other anonymous people you just met over text is almost impossible. Then most games these days people are muted or they mute you or they mute their whole team. You become your worst impulses and so do others.

It is, by far, the most unhealthy thing I put myself through.",90,,1727719107.0,Negative,0.914,sadness,0.596,-0.914,1,-0.914,0.0235,Overall Neutral

That being said immortal draft brings its own problems in ranked but in 95% of my games toxicity seems minimal and tryharding high. Might help that I’m a support player though. 

Anyways just my 2 cents, thanks for listening to my rant 😌 I do love me some unranked party queue with friends.",54,,1726061598.0,Negative,0.894,disgust,0.569,-0.894,1,-0.894,-0.3105,Overall Negative

comment,1g13ey1,lrdqy3q,t3_1g13ey1,dota2,"Puppey gets a lot of hate in this sub but personally, I admire the patience and appreciation he showed the dota fans during TI this year.

If you were at the arena and saw Puppey, you can probably attest to this but if he was standing still, a crowd of fans were created around him wherever he went during the weekend.

He'd take all the selfies of the existing crowd around him -> find 5 seconds free to move somewhere -> get stopped on the way -> a new crowd would form -> repeat.

I snapped a photo of him mid-crowd to be able to tell my friends at home about it:

Puppey stopped at the front right of the floor seating area to catch a quick look of the game and this is the crowd that has formed in [this picture (arrow on Puppey)](https://i.imgur.com/UEcO5Bc.jpeg) is what formed in less than a minute. I went took the photo, went off and queued for lunch, got it, came back to my seat and finished eating before he had moved on. He managed to get to where he was just behind my right shoulder when he got stopped by some other fans and the whole situation started over again.

And I saw this happen multiple times throughout the weekend, and Puppey seemed super happy each time.

I've been a fan of his dota gameplay for over a decade (man I'm old) but during TI I became a fan of him as a person.",554,,1728633504.0,Positive,0.527,neutral,0.44,0.527,1,0.527,-0.02562499999999998,Overall Neutral

post,1fj3wgb,,,dota2,"TI13 is the worst TI I've attended in person I've attended four TIs in person (TI6, TI8, TI12), and TI13 (TI2024) is undoubtedly the worst one. The production quality has dropped to a level where even a major from a few years ago was far superior to this year’s TI.

* In the Arena

While the arena itself is decent, the setup felt cheap — there were very limited food options, the gift shop was incredibly shabby, and the activity area was minimal. Honestly, it felt no better than attending a local concert. This was even more disappointing when compared to previous years I attended TI.

* No Free Gift Bags

This is the only TI where there were no free gift bags. All we received upon entering the arena was a ticket card and a small pin. That’s it.

* Cheap Opening Ceremony

Seriously? The opening ceremony was just a pre-recorded video. I couldn’t believe it.

* No Fun In-Between Activities

While Slack and Tsunami did a good job, their performances were about the only thing that deserved any praise. There were no other fun activities in between the games, leaving fans with little to do during breaks.

* Worst Cosplay Competition

The cosplay competition was so short that a friend who went to the bathroom missed the whole thing by the time he came back.

* No Player Interviews or Vlogs

In previous TIs, we were treated to player interviews, replays, fun games, and vlogs that gave us glimpses into the players' lives between matches. This year? Nothing. It felt empty and lacking.

* The Most Expensive TI, Yet the Worst Experience

To make matters worse, all of this ""worst of all time"" experience came at the highest ticket price of all time. It feels like the golden age of TI is over, and Valve has clearly given up on improving the professional Dota 2 scene.",2877,494,1726590966.0,Negative,0.882,disgust,0.96,-0.882,3,-2.646,-0.5916250000000001,Overall Negative

I mean they could release a single community-made chest and make enough money to actually make TI into a convention again. Weve seen that its still exciting even with a lower prize pool but I really feel like this has been spit in the face of the community who is eager to feel connection and have fun once a year to celebrate the game.   

Seems they want nothing to do with the game besides creating the game itself, which I find a damn shame when there is such a massive group of people ready to be invested in it",55,,1726595433.0,Negative,0.496,joy,0.648,-0.496,1,-0.496,-0.5916250000000001,Overall Negative

In my lowest moments, I found myself returning to DotA 2, a ""dead game"" in the eyes of many, but for me, it became an escape. Each match, each victory, and even the defeats brought a fleeting sense of purpose and relief. The familiar chaos of the game drowned out the chaos within me.

The dopamine rush from every ranked match helped me silence the echoes of pain and longing. In a strange way, this community became an unexpected comfort during these dark times.

post,1fheooz,,,dota2,"My Vengeful Spirit Arcana cosplay for TI13 Hi!! Im Vicky_kujikawa (twitter, instagram, tiktok) and I wanted to share the cosplay I have spent the past 3 months of my life fully working on.

The set is the arcana + Vision of the Seraph Scion.

It has more than 1000 unique feathers patterned and made out of eva foam, wings can be opened (idk if they captured that on stage) and both the wings and weapon have lights.

Im very sad the light on the stage was so bad because none of the lighting effects could be properly seen :( I wish it was darker. I also think the colours didnt look as pretty because of the lights again.

Im also wearing some heelless shoes to recreate her birs feet.

The fact that the arcana got released so late made me lose my sanity to complete this in time.

If anyone wants to check how I made evetthing and some close ups you can do it on my social media as I have uploaded everything there.

And of course if you like my work would aporeciate any kind of share or folloe. I have also cosplayed Death Prophet years ago (and Im very proud of that cosplay and photos!)",2741,122,1726412881.0,Negative,0.629,sadness,0.96,-0.629,3,-1.887,0.295,Overall Neutral

What really surprises me is that they didn't go for Insanias Chen when they had first-pick, letting GG snatch it up again on second pick. The series made it look like Insania has a way more shallow hero-pool than he does, his Chen is excellent and taking it away from GG seems an obvious move. But obviously they know something I don't.

post,1guh9tq,,,dota2,"I recently talked to a girl about Dota 2 Recently, I talked to a girl about Dota 2 at a posh restaurant, it did not go well.

She straight up asked me:

""Hey, what hero do you play the most?""

Upon hearing this question, my heart tightened, I began to have an intense panic attack and almost choked. So I gave my response:

""Y'know, the poison guy?""

I could see it in her eyes, a small flash of excitement.

""Oh? Viper? I love Viper, he is my main!""

I immediately tried to explain. ""N-no-""

""Then Silencer?""

""Sorry, I-""

""? He's not bad.""

""Also no...""

At this point, my head was already buried in my chest. I dared not even lift my head up, I was already sweating bullets, and the atmosphere was so awkward my twitching feet could almost penetrate a hole through the marble flooring.

""You play Broodmother? Then I'd agree it's pretty hard to say that so openly."" Her expression was already that of astonishment.

In this day and age, those who would play Broodmother are few in number. Either they still cling to old glory and sometimes OD on copium, or they are deranged in the mind. Quite pitiful they are. I felt her empathetic gaze on my neck, it shook me intensely like the time I accidently bought the battle pass bundle. I felt my face fluster, my breath got heavy, and my head dazed. I tried my damned hardest to calm my quivering legs and clenched my teeth to say the words I was about to say next. This took the last of my strength:

""Not her either!""

These words were wilted when they came out of my mouth, it's no more audible than a needle falling to a dancefloor. Though, I promise this was the loudest that I could speak at that time. I looked up. Her expression changed completely. There was a brief moment of dreadful silence.

""Then.... what hero do you play? I thought the game only had these heroes?""

Every single word she spoke struck me like hammers nailing down the last few pegs of the coffin to my weak heart. I was awestruck, my soul rendered apart by the sharpness of her words. Then, I could hold it in no more. Along with my words, a few strong-willed yet aggrieved tears rolled out of the corner of my eye.

""Venomancer, I play Venomancer.""

When I uttered his name, the discussions around us stopped, leaving me to wallop in the silence between my occasional sniffles. Feeling the pitiful gaze from passersby around me, I felt like an orphan dragging their disabled body to beg for spare change on the streets of Dota. I held my face in my hands, I was too embarrassed to let anyone see my miserable state.

She turned to leave. At this point, tears already washed my face, I was on the floor, my two arms gripped on her ankles, and didn't dare let go. I was a clown to the people around me. The last words that I let out that day before being dragged out by the security and falling into unconsciousness were spoken at that very moment.

""So what if his damage is low? It's not like he's unplayable! He will be good in the future! The devs will buff him one day, I'm sure of it.""

comment,1hg85kk,m2h73qi,t3_1hg85kk,overwatch,"That's true for many heroes. It seems they don't build over a body, they just make them as they go. Cardboard brug seems to be based more on her OW1 look, in overwatch 2 all the girls generally got thicker and more muscular

EDIT: To clarify further, it clearly just used her engineer/mechanic skin from OW1 as a base, or more accurately, it used the sparkplug skin as a base which is in turn based on the engineer/mechanic skin. Newer looks in OW2 seem to have changed hero proportions to be more in line with fan perceptions of what the characters should look like, but this is a new skin that is building from an old OW1 skin as a base

It also more realistically looks like what would fit under her tight armor for her default skins but OW2 skins showing midriff seem to have her torso expand to make up for the lack of space previously occupied by her armor. This is all probably to make sure her outline stays the same and her animations still look correct",2336,,1734433256.0,Neutral,0.786,neutral,0.884,0.0,1,0.0,-0.290875,Overall Neutral
comment,1hg85kk,m2hche6,t3_1hg85kk,overwatch,"So some games have like reused ""nude models"", basically a character model without clothes so that it's easier to model different outfits over them.

Overwatch despite its reputation, ironically doesn't have this or makes a new one for each new skin on a Hero and so the body is remade everytime with no solid vision on how the character's body should look.

This doesn't mean much for characters like Genji or Juno, but it causes alot of inconsistencies for characters like Brig and Mei.

Outside of a cinematic, there isn't a consistent answer for things on like how muscular Brig is or if Mei is even chubby or just has alot of clothes.",403,,1734436444.0,Negative,0.663,neutral,0.883,-0.663,1,-0.663,-0.290875,Overall Neutral

comment,1do31zq,la6rtw5,t3_1do31zq,overwatch,"Hello! This is a game UI practice and I thought of using my favorite game as an example. There were design decisions in this project where I considered it to be an upgrade as well as a downgrade compared to the current game. Moreover, I took inspirations from old console games, web templates, mobile apps, and operating systems from 10+ years ago to come up with visuals that resemble the late 2000s design.

I hope my design brought you back to your childhood! Also feel free to check this on my behance! [https://www.behance.net/gallery/201757859/UI-Practice-If-Overwatch-Was-a-2009-Game](https://www.behance.net/gallery/201757859/UI-Practice-If-Overwatch-Was-a-2009-Game)

It's a freaking black hole. Light cannot escape it. Snow would be easily absorbed, even if it came out bullet speeds. Beams of energy would be absorbed as well. Electrical currents would be absorbed.

post,1gjib0t,,,overwatch,"Any tips to improve? (Long text) I'm adding the meme so yk it isn't just text, but I've been playing for a really, really short time—as in, less than two weeks. I used to play a lot back when Bastion had his whole self-healing thingy and blah blah, before there were as many heroes as there are now, and I did decently at most back then. But I won't lie; I'm not the type to play shooters a lot. I'm nowhere near skilled in these types of games, and I stopped playing them—Overwatch included—until recently, when I thought, 'Why not try it again?' Honestly, I started horribly. I mean, I was so rusty to the point I barely averaged 20% or 30% accuracy if I was lucky. Recently, I got that number up to 40% or 60%, depending on the character, but I feel as if I'm stuck now. Sure, I've been playing for a short time after getting rusty, but I can't seem to improve my aim anymore. Am I trying to improve too fast, maybe? Should I try to improve my aim with maps?

post,1gpw7ze,,,overwatch,"When we say ""Old Overwatch"", we don't mean the literal launch day. Feels like this needs to be pointed out since there seems to be an influx of new OW2 players who played the classic mode and figured that's all there was to old Overwatch.

Overwatch 1 came out in 2016. Overwatch 2 came out in 2022. That's 6 years of Overwatch, 6 years of hero releases, 6 years of patches, and 6 years of varying levels of balance. What you think was the peak is subjective and up for discussion, but seeing the entirety of Overwatch 1 as a single experience is acting in very bad faith.

*""This mode sucks, you guys were really nostalgic for this?""*

Some were, I'm sure, but most of us understand that it was some time between the two titles where the game was absolute peak.

SYM? i genuinely don’t understand how you could think anyone but mei deserves it. first of all her kit matches perfectly. a big part of water bending and ESPECIALLY katana’s water bending is ice. i mean that’s literally how she started out. the show even started because she moved some ice and found aang. and what sym should have got it because her beam kinda looks like water? get out of here. secondly mei already rocks the coat and stuff, something we see katara wear throughout the show. i honestly feel like it’s so natural on mei and would probably look kinda weird on sym. mei even kinda has a similar hair thing going on. i don’t know personally i think mei was the obvious choice and i’m glad they did it. i’m just confused with all the hate on it.",6237,585,1734089699.0,Negative,0.534,surprise,0.971,-0.534,3,-1.602,-0.28800000000000003,Overall Neutral

comment,1hcx18q,m1rkqow,t3_1hcx18q,fortnite,"Save The World had IMMENSE potential.

If we were to look at the game in its earliest alpha stages, we'd see the developers genuinely caring about and making adjustments to the game. As some of us know, the game was meant to be more of a horror type PvE game with much more mature aspects in terms of husk designs and the overall atmosphere of the game.

That was changed later on to be more cartoony and fitted for teenagers. The game could've been so much more if they were to put more focus and passion into it after BR released. 

Literally this is the greatest game I've ever played. When I was a BR player in 2018 I heard of STW and that's its 'early access' and will soon be free to play. But after the state of development on June 29 2020 and the whole 'premium experience' and slow down of updates, that never happened. Of course it would be a disaster nowadays if it was free, but you get what I'm saying. 

This game could've been so much more... There is so much the devs could've done with the Twine Peaks. Just imagine y'all 🥲",142,,1734042319.0,Positive,0.57,fear,0.645,0.57,1,0.57,0.060124999999999984,Overall Neutral

**Bugs**

* With chat disabled pressing Enter prevents you from interacting until you press ESC again. So basically despite it being disabled you can still activate it without seeing it.
* Closing the inventory no longer works via the same key, you have to press ESC or physically move you mouse over the close button.

**Annoyances**

* Chat auto fades after 3 seconds.
* Everytime someone joins the chabox pops up.
* The chatbox shouldn't should even be there, just chat on screen like before which slowly fades away after 30 seconds until you hit Enter again to chat. The only chatbox that should be on screen is the input box, and only when typing, it should hide after you pressed Enter.

post,1h4tyil,,,fortnite,"New XP cap is anti consumer and it should be adressed publicly. Imagine this - you just found out about Fortnite and about STW. Save the World has sold you and you want to play it but you're also not interested in BR or any other gamemodes at all.   
Also, the game advertises itself that you can earn XP anywhere you want and you aren't forced to play a certain gamemode.

So you install fortnite, buy the BPass and buy access to STW. Everything seems great, you just reached your first few levels and got first few rewards and you think to yourself ""how cool of them to let me gain XP for the pass by playing my favourite gamemode!""

But the player doesn't realize one thing - the season lasts exactly 105 days (or 14 weeks and few days) which means the weekly cap will be reset exactly 14 times before season ends

If my math is correct - 14 x 9 = 117  
Which basically means we are no longer able to finish the BPass fully by the end of this season just by playing STW 

Now let's get back to the theoritical new player that doesn't realize that and he missess out on big amount of rewards from the BPass, because they didn't play BR or did any challanges from other gamemodes.

They basically wasted their money, are angry and were forced to slowly crawl they way through the pass, just to be greeted with end of the season and lack of any chance to get rest of the rewards...

This is EXTREMELY anti-consumer friendly, especially since STW is a paid gamemode unlike rest of the game. What am I or any other person supposed to do now if I want to reach level 200 but aren't interested in playing BR or any other metaslop vomited onto my screen? Did Epic even considered that there are people that spent 99% of their time in STW?

post,1gxx8i6,,,fortnite,"Founder's Weapons Okay so I made a Live Chat with Epic Games asking about a possibile return of Founder's Weapons. I asked because every Founder's Weapon has its Exclusive Perk. No other weapons have these perks. For example the Founder's Revolt has the Exclusive Perk that makes projectiles bounce to another enemy. The other ones have perks that gives a more Reload Speed, Damage or similar things...so nothing so special in my opinion. Instead speaking of the Nocturno...well...it's fantastic. Its Exclusive Perk is probably underrated but with a good hero build you can make a ton of damage with it and with the explosion. So what did they say?

Briefly no. But they told me to suggest this thing in one of their official channel. Actually I'm posting it in r/FORTnITE but I'll repost in the official one (r/FortniteBR) cuz they said I can post Save The World topic there too. 

Anyway, back in the suggestion:
Following the Exclusivity in Battle Royale with the cosmetics (like reskins or just different colors of exclusive skins), they could make a new Weapon Schematic with the same Exclusive Perk but with different perks or less damage, crit chance, crit damage, fire rate, reload speed, mag size or anything else. Doing this they won't make Founders mad about letting an expensive thing available again and at the same time giving the access of new builds etc to non Founders Players.

...or maybe they can add again the Founder's Bundle without V-Bugs Earnings.

I hope the StW Devs will read this hoping to be a good suggestion or something to encourage them to do something about it. Thanks for your attention. :)",621,210,1732359842.0,Positive,0.565,neutral,0.638,0.565,3,1.6949999999999998,0.29824999999999996,Overall Neutral

Like, I want to remind people that EpicGames fell bass-ackwards into success after using Fortnite's engine to rip off PUBG to cash in on a trend, and the only reason they ever look competent is because they have enough money to shrug off any amount of stupidity. 

They literally operate a store that its own internal estimates say won't be profitable until 2028. They became the biggest non-government funder of Ukraine just for PR. They have lost THREE class-action lawsuits. They got their game removed from half of the mobile market off a publicity stunt for a legal battle they half lost. Epic is not playing 5D chess.

comment,1eqlibr,lhsvg4b,t3_1eqlibr,apexlegends,"As a guys who wants to play Caustic and tries to a lot, its a compound issue and frankly he just sucks.  I play him for fun, but my stats and success plummet and eventually switch back to another hero where I can be effective on damage, movement, or support. 

1. He’s particularly bad against the top picked characters.  All the top mobility characters are the top picks overall. They all can so easily avoid a barrel.  There’s essentially no situation where mobility characters can’t just get around or over a well fortified position.  And likewise, he doesn’t pair well with any of them when they are on your team too.  It’s hard to control a building when your Pathfinder has success being a flying squirrel. 

2.  Out in the open he’s a massive liability.  Not only is he a beefy target with no escape moves and no cover, but he can cause full squad death because teams will push that situation too.  He used to have some cover with a barrel, kind of, but that’s gone now too. 

3.  So many of the new locations are obviously built in such a way to limit his ability to set up well.  Multiple entry points, rooftop access, windows galore, or rooms that are so small they are just death traps.  So any attempt to control almost seems like an invitation to get sniped, grenade spammed, Fuse or Maggie spammed, or all of the above.  Vertical noise is confusing as hell too, so you generally don’t want to be caught with a team buzzing around your building now knowing where they will hit you from. 

4.  Even if someone really gets sucked into a barrel trap, everyone is now wise to the fact that they deal like 7 damage.  Many have simply adjusted to fighting through it and using their own abilities to gain back a damage advantage.  Like a Shiela, or even Balastics tactical. 

5.  When they made the barrels easily destroyable, they added a third way to laugh in caustics face.  Now players can easily avoid them, take the low damage, or destroy them, depending on whatever is most advantageous to them given the scenario. 

6. They keep adding ways to best the gas and it adds up over time. Watson stops him (even a friendly one!), Lifeline can just healing drone, Altar teleports through walls. Fuses larger AOE will pop barrels before you can replace them, bigger Maggie big fire will destroy one through a wall before a push, and on and on. Now you can get two-shotted with blue armor by Vantage as you sloth across an open area.  More legends and new abilities - so much different when there were like 8-10 total and only a couple had direct counters. 

He’s honestly just miserable to play and #2 has been his major issue for a long time.  That was always his Achilles which is fine, but now he has 100 Achilles. You’re just a dead duck during transition which is horrible in a team game with randoms.  You basically need a character to give you mobility or else you will get caught on the move. 

So I actually think he’s worse in casual than top tier play.  People don’t care as much so it’s not as flagrant but his kit creates liability and does almost nothing to help others.  You can’t even control well if you’re playing with the top mobility characters who won’t benefit from staying in a room or building with you. 

PS: Oh right, and all the new Crypto love means you're just a duck for their ult

comment,1e3y50x,ldbgioj,t3_1e3y50x,apexlegends,"Tip for fighting these guys: don't mag dump them when they are first coming in with all their momentum, that's exactly what they are trying to get you to do to give themselves an advantage. Make yourself hard to hit cause it will be very difficult for them to hit you while they are moving like this if you aren't standing still. Know they will lose their momentum, capitalize on that. 

Some other tips: A lot of people get shell shocked seeing this but know that they will change direction after jumping, this makes this patterns predictable and you should take advantage of that. If you are on controller you should anti-mirror their strafe (strafe opposite direction they are strafing), this will maximize the aim assist. If you are on MnK you may want to mirror their strafe, but this could make yourself easier to hit so be aware of that. Also try not to overaim, since they usually move around a center point it is better to underaim—that applies to both inputs but is easier to mess up on MnK",724,,1721063540.0,Negative,0.566,surprise,0.719,-0.566,1,-0.566,-0.7208749999999999,Overall Negative

Like i heard this first from a youtube video but the video didn't include the part ""they want an art piece"" so when the ignite fan came to global shop i was short like 40 vps. I explained it and asked for vp. They actually gave the vp after several hours and told me ""We decided to give you extra vp this time however we will want an art project next time, doesn't need to be good at all.

post,1d30v9r,,,valorant,"Reyna is a failure of game design Reyna is poorly designed in Valorant and doesn't teach players how to play the game properly, leading to a high amount of Reyna mains in mid-high elo with the game sense of a bronze player. In this essay i will... etc etc

**The only lesson to be learned from your mistakes playing Reyna is that you didn't get the kill**



1. **Reyna does not teach players to position well**

Imagine this scenario where, on round start, a defender runs it down B long on bind looking for a pick and runs into the entire enemy team.



https://preview.redd.it/itb7rjtij93d1.png?width=256&format=png&auto=webp&s=014c7a78036772c02a4c5c31d116d240483ee359

Your average scenario here with almost any agent is that you run out into a 1v5 and die. You'd probably think to yourself ""wow all 5 of them were there, that was a dumb spot to stand. I should play further back so I can escape or get a teammate to double peek with me and use util to secure.""

Now let's swap that out for Reyna.



https://preview.redd.it/mj45oq5xj93d1.png?width=196&format=png&auto=webp&s=eebb66eab754fd9aa19c11a82baa085ad7b83709

Reyna runs out, sees 5 enemies and dies, but instead the lesson learned is

**""My aim was bad, I would've been fine if I got a kill.""**

Reyna will then try the same strategy again, and when she gets a kill she is rewarded and her behaviour is reinforced by dismissing and retreating back to site.



**2. Reyna does not teach players how to effectively use utility for anyone other than herself**



https://preview.redd.it/dyvll0njl93d1.png?width=292&format=png&auto=webp&s=eb8cb060f386c66c2cf894934bb6c329d58722f6

Reyna's only situational piece of utility is a near-sight blind. She is the only character in the entire game that has a castable blind with **NO** downsides. Every single other ability in the game that blinds **affects your  teammates**. It's also one of 2 blinds in the entire game that **goes through walls**. If you throw a skye flash directly out into the middle of a fight or throw your omen blind from the backline you could blind your whole team and lose the fight.

Picture this scenario on Ascent A-site. Attacker team is doing a full push against 3 defenders on A.



https://preview.redd.it/0hmt91xsm93d1.png?width=375&format=png&auto=webp&s=39208c9ae239c788a6b611aeba6acc96c8302fa1

If omen misuses his blind here, he blinds the Jett playing dice, but also blinds his Deadlock and Clove. This puts the attackers at a massive disadvantage. Omen's team loses the push and Omen gets flamed for team flashing. Omen, who wants to avoid this in the future, learns from his mistake. He now knows that he needs to stand off to the side, or be aware of where his teammates are standing when he throws his blind.

Now we swap omen out for Reyna



https://preview.redd.it/0o1eiqwin93d1.png?width=271&format=png&auto=webp&s=434d197e7ce86b471bdef99ea5e1ee5b2c590fe5

Reyna can throw her blind anywhere, in any situation. It blinds anyone who can see it from any range. Reyna's team pushes the site, and if Reyna and her team dies her only lesson to be learned again is

**""My aim was bad, I would've been fine if I got a kill.""**

**3. Reyna does not teach players how to effectively use ultimate abilities**

Every single ultimate ability in this game **except for Reyna's** has a set of use case scenarios, and a set of non-use case scenarios. For example, you wouldn't phoenix ult in the middle of site, you'd get punished. You wouldn't use your kj ult in mid, you'd get punished. Reyna's ultimate is the only ultimate in the entire game that can be used effectively on round start **every time it's available.** There is no downside to using the Reyna ult, you cannot disadvantage or kill your teammates with the Reyna ult, you cannot put yourself at a disadvantage with the Reyna ult. You cannot waste the Reyna ult by any measure other than inactivity. The only lesson to be learned from dying and losing the Reyna ult is, again:

**""My aim was bad, I would've been fine if I got a kill.""**



**4. Reyna does not teach players about trade opportunities**

Reyna's dismiss and heal mechanics effectively allow her to cancel or heavily mitigate any trade opportunities presented to her enemies.

https://preview.redd.it/l54e3lr4q93d1.png?width=298&format=png&auto=webp&s=05edc1773df62f96f4a8e5f20c7658ab50469eea

In this scenario on Split's mail/heaven area, lets pretend it's pistol round and everyone here has a ghost and no armor. Fade has swung into the Harbor. Fade gets the jump on Harbor and although Harbor manages to heavily tag the Fade, she secures the kill on him. As soon as this happens Gekko, who is nearby is able to quickly swing into position before the Fade is ready and secure the kill, trading out his teammate and securing the round. If Gekko is faster and both players are able to fight Fade together, she is very likely to still lose, even if she kills the Harbor. Fade has learned a valuable lesson in that if she is taking a fight, she needs to be prepared for someone else to swing her and take measures, such as backing off the angle and re-positioning, using dog to stop the trade, or playing a safer angle to begin with. If Fade takes damage in a fight, she's less likely to win the next fight and will likely be traded out. Now lets swap Fade out for Reyna:



https://preview.redd.it/atvodso5r93d1.png?width=301&format=png&auto=webp&s=50dafcbcfccb20ba05780b14cccfd2cec73ce700



Again, lets pretend it's pistol round and all 3 players have a ghost. Reyna pushes and while Harbor manages to heavily tag her, Reyna secures the kill. Reyna immediately activates her heal and is suddenly swung by Gekko. She now has more health than she had when she was fighting Harbor, and is able to secure the kill on Gekko as well. Reyna does not have to worry about being tagged and easily traded out on low-hp, and therefore does not need to have a plan to disengage. If Gekko is able to swing before Harbor is killed, as long as Reyna gets the kill on Harbor, she is able to dismiss and disengage from the fight and cancel the trade for free. If Reyna loses this fight, the only lesson to be learned is, again:

**""My aim was bad, I would've been fine if I got a kill.""**



So where does this leave players that only play Reyna? They've learned in almost every situation that their aim was poor and that they just needed to secure the kill to win. Every win condition in Valorant is getting the kill. There are no nuances or complex mechanics to interact with in this game **as long as you get the kill**. You do not need to perfect your utility usage and site takes **as long as you get the kill.** You don't need to worry about being traded **as long as you get the kill**.

**What are the consequences of this?**

We've seen from the above examples that Reyna is far too easy and far too forgiving to players, and while other players using different agents are climbing the ranks learning a wide variety of skills such as effective utility usage, strategy, positioning, teamwork and other meta-knowledge, Reyna players are learning that their only mistake was not getting the kill.

Thank you for listening to my TED talk

**tl;dr reyna as an agent does not have to interact with almost any of the complex systems and strategies of Valorant and people that only play Reyna are not given equal learning opportunities to their peers, only developing their aim leaving their game sense in the gutter.**",4492,853,1716947529.0,Negative,0.891,disgust,0.296,-0.891,3,-2.673,-0.22475,Overall Neutral

post,1fp1pz2,,,valorant,"The end for my journey, and my dream Hello everyone, I’m kei, and this is my goodbye to Valorant and my dream that is no longer achievable for me. Sorry in advance for any grammatical, punctual errors and so on and so forth because it’s hard for me to text, and I’m a little bit of emotional rn. 
So what was that dream? To become a pro player. For the most of you it may sound silly, and childish, but for me it was a brightly burning passion, to which I dedicated myself with a whole heart. I love Valorant and everything about it. I love E-sports, I love agents, I love in-game mechanics, even movement. Everything for me is perfect, but this doesn’t matter anymore. 
The reason why I’m writing this is because since I was born I had a disease that caused an irreversible damage to my eyes, and I’m partially disabled, but despite of that I was able to play like a normal person, without any trouble, till the 21 of September of this year hit. I got another kind of disease that affected my right eye, and the center of it is in a kind of blur, so it makes it so I can’t aim in game at all. I just cannot see. 
I know that I could write 3+ paragraphs about my journey, love, and burning passion to it, but I think for everyone who decided to read this epitaph of my dream is way too much yapping. 
Have a great day, pursue your dreams at any cost if it makes your heart burn with passion, and goodbye Valorant, I love you",4240,182,1727262269.0,Positive,0.669,sadness,0.944,0.669,3,2.007,0.644125,Overall Positive

comment,1dm2wlv,l9t4p0m,t3_1dm2wlv,valorant,"This is pretty cool. So it doesn’t snap to head, it just gives you lower sens when you overlap with a body.

I like the approach though. It's so ""simple"" that I'm sure quite a lot of the time designers would just scrap it early on, but in practice that looks like it works very nicely given valorant's gameplay. Wouldn't work in a game like COD, but definitely makes sense for a tac shooter. Gives me old mobile-fps vibes.",40,,1719088856.0,Positive,0.843,neutral,0.899,0.843,1,0.843,0.25325,Overall Neutral

post,1ffrcmo,,,valorant,"Why does Harbor tell the enemy team how to dodge his ULT? Is he stupid?

For those who are unaware (considering his abysmal pick rate) after summoning his big rain puddle (that is for some reason called an ultimate) he makes an urgent and important announcement for the whole enemy team ""I sudjest youu moooove!""

Like, thanks? But why are you helping the enemy team, bro?

The first time I was playing against him I knew shit about his abilities and when I found myself in the **deadly** pond of water I thought that was the end but this kind man's advice saved my life.

I was so unprepared of an enemy helping me that I thought someone from my team sudjested me moooving through the voice chat.

So I wonder why people are not so willing to play this agent, lmao.

Isn't him helping like this considered sabotaging or griefing btw?

post,1f0ukcs,,,valorant,"AverageJonas just announced he is quitting VALORANT permenately While it's sad to see such a major and pivotal player in the community leave, it is also understandable. Some of the reasons that AverageJonas raises for leaving are feeling burnt out and wishing to move on to other games like Dota, Palworld and the new game ""Deadlock"" by Valve. Good luck AverageJonas on your new journey 🫡.

comment,1fobgh6,loosh9h,t3_1fobgh6,minecraft,"Seen a little confusion here, so consider this the educational comment. If I made any mistakes, feel free to correct me.

HRT is short for hormone replacement therapy. It's basically where you medicate with hormones to help rebalance your body's hormones to help you feel comfortable. It's a form of gender affirming care.

It's commonly associated with transitioning from one gender to another, but this isn't the only application of HRT. Cisgendered people (people who identify as the gender they were assigned at birth) can also take hormone suppliments, for example, some men will experience a drop in their testosterone levels (T-Levels) as they get older, and they may take testosterone to regulate this.

There are many ways to take Estrogen/Testosterone during HRT. Injections, creams, and pills are all common application methods. I'm not 100% what determines what you get, whether certain methods are more effective than others, etc. But basically any way the human body can absorb it is fair game.",841,,1727184995.0,Neutral,0.659,neutral,0.962,0.0,1,0.0,0.55075,Overall Positive

post,1fy8i7p,,,minecraft,"My son’s Minecraft Make A Wish My son is 9 years old and has Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy.  He was granted a wish from Make A Wish and I’ve been talking with him to try to help him come up with a wish.  He’s been playing Minecraft more than half of his life and it’s his favorite thing in the world.  His wish is to see the headquarters where his favorite game is made.  First he asked to go to Mojang in Sweden but from what I read online, it’s just a bunch of offices and maybe not as magical as he thinks.  I don’t know much about the US Mojang headquarters in Redmond, WA but maybe that would be a better destination for his wish?  

Maybe there is a better idea for a Minecraft related wish?  Maybe attend the movie premiere for the Minecraft movie? Or is there some other Minecraft destination that should be on our radar?

comment,1fy8i7p,lqs6z4m,t3_1fy8i7p,minecraft,"I highly recommend you reach out to Mojang (Make A Wish can probably help with that) and explain your situation to them. The people there will know what possibilities there are, and chances are they'll be able to arrange things that we wouldn't even think of. Given how popular this game is, it wouldn't surprise me if they've done this sort of thing for lots of other children.  
  
> First he asked to go to Mojang in Sweden but from what I read online, it’s just a bunch of offices and maybe not as magical as he thinks.  
  
It is indeed just an office building, but he might still enjoy it depending on his interests. A lot of well-known Minecraft developers work there, so chances are he might get to meet some of the people he looks up to. They might also be able to show him some of the behind-the-scenes stuff that happens during development, which can be super interesting as well. Bet they've got some cool prototypes and other work-in-progress stuff laying around that they might be able to show off as well.",8802,,1728311889.0,Positive,0.529,surprise,0.506,0.529,1,0.529,0.6455,Overall Positive
