I just spent the last 3 hours figuring out why I couldn't get into Windows because my keyboard and mouse wouldn't work. Just before that, I started smelling hot plastic - my graphics card was running +90°C because again, Vanguard disabled my cooling software (My PC case got very bad airflow, I have to decrease my GPU performance to keep it cool enough).

Vanguard really needs to prevent us from launching the game while X software is active -and asking us to close it, even if we need to reboot just after- instead of disabling everything silently.

EDIT regarding my GPU: the issue with my graphics card started few days ago but I wasn't able to link it to Vanguard. Since my case was made to hold a GT630, the airflow sucks hard and I made a profile which I always use with target performance at 75% for my GTX970. Less performance, but less heat and then less noise. Few days ago, Asus GPU Tweak gave me ""Error BIOS load failed"" when starting, and my GPU was spinning like crazy in a TFT game. I didn't fry my GPU (but others are claiming so), but it's not comfortable at all for me to have it blowing at fullspeed when playing a TFT game.

&#x200B;

u/RiotArkem got downvoted into hell, so i'll copy/pasta what he said just in case

"" We're working on ways to make the experience better. Our current notification pop-ups aren't as good as they could be and we're looking for ways to give you more control over how Vanguard works.

We're happy to do anything we can to make this smoother for everyone as long as it doesn't give an opening for cheaters.

TL;DR: Expect improvements before launch.""

post,valorant,2020,gdl3es,"I redesigned the Valorant ranked icons. What do you think? Hi all, I’m a UI/UX designer. My friends and I were very excited for Valorant ranked, and disappointed when we saw the icons. When I heard Shroud complain in one of his videos, I felt the need to give the icons my own hot take.

**Why I felt like the Valorant ranked icons were lacking:**

* Silhouettes are not distinct enough
* Platinum is a rusted copper color
* Immortal and Valorant don’t feel powerful enough
* Tiers are cleverly incorporated into the icons, but it makes every rank feel the same, and not intuitive

**What I tried to achieve in my design:**

* Progression of silhouettes. Each rank grows upon the last
* Intuitive colors that rank up with you
* “Make Immortal and Valorant great again”
* Easy to tell which tier
* Taking advantage of the existing Valorant imagery, such as:
   * Valorant logo
   * Valorant ranked icon
   * Ultimate charge dots
   * Valorant loading screen spark animation

Here is my design:

[Colored](https://preview.redd.it/74o9bevakyw41.png?width=8288&format=png&auto=webp&s=934c467ad9e38045fe2959b26aa5557e31b00e0a)

I reused as many of the original colors as possible. I eventually had to do some tweaking because bronze, gold, immortal used very similar colors. I used Phoenix as inspiration for Immortal, which seems apt, right?

Here’s a mockup of what it would look like in-game (screenshot taken from somewhere on Reddit):

**My design process:**

* Sketching a fuck ton of ideas and researching ranked icons from other video games
* Looking at a lot of Valorant imagery to create a moodboard
* Mocking up icons in Figma (because I’m a UI/UX designer) in grayscale first to create distinct silhouettes
* Adding colors
* Mocking it up on a screenshot to see what it would look like

Overall, took me a day to do. Shout-out to my boyfriend who gave really helpful critiques throughout the process. Hope you all like it!

post,valorant,2020,hpwcho,"The Current OP Meta is a Result of all of Valorant's Combined Flaws. Hey guys, I'm a 10 year CS player here. Previously played at Level 9 Faceit and A - ESEA. Have probably 1000+ hours of watching pro games under my belt, and even more spent in KZ and HnS servers. I love Valorant, and I love a lot of what they're trying to do with this game in comparison to CS. But, I think the current OP meta is a result of almost every short coming the game has right now (for the most part).

Firstly, I think it's important to preface this by saying that Valorant is 100% by design, made to be easier / more approachable than CS:GO. You can see this in almost every aspect of the game. If it's something that was intimidating to new players in CS, it's been massively simplified here. Spray patterns are far less aggressive. Lineups have been almost entirely eliminated, or completely streamlined. Movement speed has been reduced to allow for easier tracking and aiming. Counter-strafing has been forgotten and replaced by instant momentum. Even the slight advantage you got from good movement (brought along by thousands of hours of practice in CS:GO) has been entirely eliminated by a massive simplification of movement in general, as well as how severe tagging is. I'm not saying these are negative aspects of the game. I understand almost if not all of these changes. Tons of these choices succeed in their desired goal, and it's lead to tons of my friends enjoying this game despite never getting more than 4 games into CS.

With all that said tho, lots of these choices indirectly feed into the current OP meta.

I don't say this lightly either. If you were to directly compare the AWP and the OP, the AWP is hands down 3x more powerful than the OP currently is.

It boasts :

* More ammo overall, and more ammo per clip.
* Instantaneous ADS, and instantaneous Accuracy after scoping in. (though this is more a trait of all scoped weapons in CS:GO)
* Better hip-fire accuracy.
* Higher ROF
* More forgiving movement accuracy

//Thanks to u/IAmNotOnRedditAtWork for pointing some of these out as they escaped me

I have a shortish video on this, with some old community server / lower level faceit games. It's presented as more of a frag movie than anything so there's no need to watch it, but I do think it can offer some important context when talking about how insane the AWP actually is for high level players.

I've edited it to have specific time stamps in the description so that you can jump between the clips that are actually relevant to this discussion. Turn down volume as there is music and I'm sure its obnoxious. [Here you go](https://youtu.be/pOV2nbWDYro)

Despite the obvious advantages the AWP has, we don't really see it being as prevalent and oppressive as we do in Valorant. We do not see double AWP and Triple AWP rounds being NEAR as viable as they are here, with triple AWP rounds being almost nonexistent.

I chalk this up to quite a few things :

&#x200B;

* Movement speed. I think this is discounted quite a bit by nearly everyone. But people fail to realize how big of a deal this really is. I don't think I need to elaborate on this too much. But I think it's important to highlight ""punishing"" an AWPer. Typically, in CS you're only going to punish an AWPer if they miss their shot. Sure you can smoke them off or flash them, but typically at a high level they'll be playing in a position where it's easy to fall back and avoid being traded if they do get flashed off their angle, that is until you're on site. (Also important to note that not all AWPers play aggressive at lower levels). If it's mathematically easier to hit shots in Valorant, you bet your ass this is having an overall effect on how consistent this weapon can perform. It also (purposefully) eliminates the usefulness of jiggle peeking or baiting shots, which is a massive part of counter-play in CS. I'm not saying they should increase movement speed. I just think pointing this out is healthy for understanding and discussing this topic as a whole.

&#x200B;

* Movement Speed pt. 2. On top of movement speed in Valorant being much lower, many CS players will probably tell you that the way in which you move in Valorant is instantaneous. There is no counter strafing, and as a result, if you were to stand still, and then start running, you reach your max velocity almost immediately, if not immediately. This is the same in reverse. You lose your momentum the second you let go off WASD, your momentum being what brings about innaccuracy. This allows the OP to be hyper aggressive in situations where it shouldn't be. Period. You can hold an angle, whiff your shot, and then repeek that same angle aggressively all because you have no aim penalty within a time frame where your aggression should be punishable. In CS:GO the max velocity is higher, and the acceleration has a longer time between min and max. This makes it so that repeeking an angle has a window of innaccuracy that is PARAMOUNT in balancing for a weapon like this. The OP in Valorant currently has little counter-play outside of maybe DDoSing your opponent and hoping they miss shots.'

&#x200B;

* Utility. This isn't a secret. Most the player-base is probably aware in some form that this is having an effect on the meta. On top of there being very little vision limiting utility (smokes), I think the lack of counter play regarding flashes is also an issue. In CS, it's usually quite easy to see a flash coming, and depending on your weapon and/or position, either turn and avoid the flash, or to turn and run entirely. Sometimes if it's a pop flash you'll tank it and pray you don't die. But in Valorant, the flashes are very very quick to pop, and they last almost no time at all. You can't act off your own flash at all on most angles, and ton's of choke points require you to walk a distance where the flash is entirely negated anyway. For instance, Ascent A site. If you flash from main the distance between main and site is large enough that most people holding close aren't going to be flashed by the time you're pushed up. So maybe you get the AWPer off the long angle they're holding, and then you start pushing only for the person holding close to take contact and have the AWPer peek back out. This is why we see Phoenix being so viable in TSM's lineup. Flashing out smokes gives the entire team the biggest possible window in order to act on that utility. It's basically equivalent to a pop flash in CS, and also allows you to have more control over where you're flashing onto a site. So you can flash and pop out of the smoke much quicker than if you were around a corner, and you can also flash much deeper into a choke point then you'd normally be able to. That said, this is not a direct counter to OP meta. It's just an issue with flashes I've noticed, and a sort of ""work around"" I've seen take center stage.

And this kinda brings me to my next issue. And probably the one we all should have expected.

&#x200B;

* Map design. Outside of most the maps feeling incredibly linear, and despite them feeling like Hallway simulator 2020. I think there's another issue in relation to thoughtful map design. One of the things I mentioned above was how certain elements were streamlined, in relation to utility mainly. This, in my opinion, also relates to the map design.

CS has very tried and true bits of utility at play. Smokes, Mollies, and Flashes. When you play CS at a level where executes are necessary, it's actually quite fascinating to learn how each map has been designed with utility constantly in mind. Cache B site for instance, there's a window directly above site meant for throwing utility. Mirage A has a massive area above ramp for throwing util. Inferno Apts even has fucking windows on the opposite side of site, with a chimney adjacent to them in order for you to bank utility off of. Dust 2 recently underwent a change in B tuns to allow for more utility and site executes given how hard the site was too take control of. Whether it be on attacks or retakes. Valorant has streamlined ""utility"" so much, that they've forgotten the exact reason why it was implemented in the way that it was in CS:GO, and why it worked so well. Valorant has thrown thoughtful map design out the window in favor of meaningless gimmicks that fall flat after your 5th game on the map.

Guess what Riot, I don't care about opening and closing destructible doors, or ropes that give you a surprising amount of velocity and accuracy while attached, and definitely not 3 fucking sites. I play ranked games where my opponents go 3-14 and then start fragging out when they decide to whip out the OP. The gun is too easy to use and it sports almost zero counter-play. IT IS AN ISSUE. I understand not jumping the gun and rushing towards some half ass balancing decision, but you've been so quick to address smaller issues that didn't actively suck the fun out of the game and reward players for using an obvious crutch.

// People have pointed out some poor phrasing on my part here, would just like to iterate that I'm not against these kinds of gimmicks, they have a place and I don't mean to undermine anyone who enjoys them. I just think these gimmicks are being used in place of good map design. Sort of a ""sure ascent is a terrible map but here are some doors you can open and close, this one has ropes!""

Ascent is the closest map to CS design we currently have in Valorant in my opinion, and it still ignores most of what made those maps work in the first place. Scrap the gimmicks. Nobody wants this random shit. I want maps with intelligent design choices, meaningful spots for fair trades at the beginning of rounds, I want maps designed with rotates in mind and counter-play at heart. You can tell CS maps are designed with all the games utility in mind. I'm constantly reminded that I can't say the same about any of Valorant's maps.

With that being said, what are some ways to fix these issues?

&#x200B;

1. Add a slight time frame with the OP that adds inaccuracy after moving, keep this outside of movement speed, have it be its own value. For instance, if you scope in with the OP, then strafe to the side and stop moving, add an extra .5 or whatever amount of time where there is still an innaccuracy debuff applied. OPs are meant for holding angles, they are already ridiculously good at that in this game. Punish them for playing aggressive.
2. Phoenix's flash needs a slight ""rework"" to come more into line with vision blocking utility in relation to cutting off angles. Phoenix's flash shouldn't pop so quickly. I think it sports niche usability with little counter-play. When throwing out Phoenix's flash, have it hover in air at the very end of it's duration while giving it an obvious ""charge-up"" animation, give a larger (but still small) window in order to either back off an angle, or to turn your back too it, and then have it pop, and increase the time frame in which you're flashed slightly. I also considered having Phoenix be invulnerable to his flash, as a way to give Phoenix a way to more reliably entry, while still forcing him to play slightly outside of his team in these situations, (or risk flashing them). This promotes playing anti flash and/or less predictable and maybe even more dangerous positions in order to deny Phoenix this ground when he attempts to entry. I think it adds a reasonable amount of counter play in a game that severely lacks it currently, I think it gives Phoenix some needed independence and room to make these types of solo plays, while also letting an agent specifically gain ground around OPers. I think a good way to envision this is Ascension A site. Instead of OPing heaven when you know Phoenix likes to flash in from main and push you off your angle, you can play on site to the left, and play anti flash in order to kill him when he attempts to entry. Diagram [Here](https://ibb.co/NL9g8WW)
3. LET YOUR COMMUNITY DESIGN MAPS FOR YOU. For the love of god the fact that I even have to say this makes me angry. Community interaction has lead to CS being the powerhouse of an E-sport it is today. Volcano's involvement is proof of this. No one is saying you have to add them as actual competitive maps, but acting like you can produce better content than your entire community is ridiculously naive when you've already shown that's NOT the case. Add some kind of community tool for your players to design maps, and have some kind of game mode that rotates these featured community maps every couple of months or something. Even if it's just to give the team at Riot ideas and inspiration. I was worried months ago when you said you weren't going to allow even the most basic of community creativity in this regard. It's okay to be wrong Riot. Valve was smart enough to realize the community could carry some of that workload, while also teaching them and giving them inspiration. Volcano is on your dev team because of this reality.",2020-07-12T23:39:36,LABEL_2,0.561060905456543

post,valorant,2022,v1v76x,"Playing in Iron is the complete human experience, and here's why 1. It is jazz. Lineups don't exist. Instead, players improvise their utilities based on their mood and the current situation. You'll never see them use those utilities in that exact way ever again, and that's what makes them magical. Tear away the veneer of practice and learned habits, and you have raw human expression. Viper walls cast seemingly at random, Sova darts that give more information than they get. An ambitious Sage who learns to place her wall on top of boxes can be found proudly standing atop a new box every round.
  
2. It is human connection. Duels are just that: Duels. There's no TTK, there's no reaction time. Two players meet each other like vagrants in the night. Their friends are far away, they are strangers to each other. They unload an entire clip at each other, sometimes all at once, sometimes in bursts between peeking and hiding. They cut each other's hair, they lick each other's toes. By the time one has killed the other, he has come to view his fallen opponent less as a stranger and more as a dear companion in a brutal world. He feels grief and mourns the loss.  
  
3. It teaches contentment. Iron players know every feeling. We are the tiniest fish in the ocean of Valorant. We are the minnows, and it's the poor fish between us and sharks who come into our little pools and beat up on us when the sharks are through with them. But we accept it, and instead of passing on this trauma, we sublimate it down within ourselves and become stronger, though not better. We have died to the last bullet of a full Odin spray, we have been caught with our knives out, we have peeked angles that were clearly being held by a sniper, we have wasted a full clip and then been killed by a Frenzy, a Stinger, or a slurry of Guardian bodyshots, we have watched someone reload their gun in front of us and then kill us with it. We have felt it all. We did it again the next round. And it's okay. We have found peace.  
  
4. It is true love. The same ocean teems with covetous, desirous, rapacious fish. Little fish seek bigger fish, and plot still for even bigger fish. No such delusions in Iron. Every human connection is genuine. Girls love boys for who they are and not their skill, which is little, and vice versa, and vice vica, and verse versa. There are no clout chasers, no rank chasers, no one adds anyone else in Iron with the false hope that they'll be carried to Diamond. Connections are made to deepen the individual experience in a way that only love can. Without the pretense, two gamers together can create a jazz that one alone never could, this is the power of true love.",2022-06-01T01:14:37,LABEL_1,0.5313147306442261

post,valorant,2020,ifsbki,"The vandal's First bullet inaccuracy is ridiculous. I was playing an unrated match yesterday using the vandal and this happened, as shown in the clip I started to tap-fire the enemy sova in the head while we were BOTH not moving and he was looking in a different direction while using the operator and the bullets just kept going to the sides of his head. Honestly, I don't know why first bullet inaccuracy with the vandal is so bad or why it's even a thing in the game in the first place.

EDIT: After reading a lot of comments on this thread I've taken into consideration the fact that I could've used ADS and crouching for more accuracy, that's something I typically do if I'm in very long-range combat, like for example when pushing C long on heaven, but I don't think that at the distance I was standing at on the clip to be fair for my bullets to be so inaccurate while standing still, putting my crosshair right on the sova's head, tap-firing and missing the first three shots.

Also i wanna point out 2 things about Deathmatch, that minimap update every 5 secs or so was really not necessary, maybe show players who stay in the same spot for too long.

post,valorant,2020,iejymh,"Valorant Agent Concept: Quantum So I devoted some of my time and mediocre art skills to creating a concept for a Valorant agent!  


Meet Quantum! I took some design and lore inspiration from already existing things in Valorant, and got to thinking about what an agent out of my imagination would look and play like. I'm not too great at art but I had fun coming up with the concept nonetheless. Hope you all like it too! :)

post,valorant,2020,j6mfol,"Wardell accused me of streaming sniping and it kind of tilts me. I'm diamond 2 btw and got matched with his smurf.

For one I had no idea who he was till the very end of the game when i looked him up due to the other team giving hints. I mean like fuck I made a a few good plays and then he said ""stop stream sniping "" . Our whole team became confused and then we all assumed hes some big streamer and tried guessing. 

The other team said subroza and during second to last round I wanted to see who it was before it ended . Subroza was offline so I checked wardell and boom it was him lol. I watched our match through his vod and he was lowkey kind of toxic lol. Accused us of stream sniping since early rounds when we weren't. 

It's kind of like disrespectful to me that making good plays turn into insults and shit. I was honored to play against him but now my opinion of wardells personality have changed .We wouldn't have known at all if he just kept quiet in chat lol.

Btw we lost 12-14 and I bottom fragged.  He's just better ofc.

Edit: okay didn't expect this to blow up. I don't want this to start a witch hunt on wardell. It's just as a fan  I felt a bit disappointed.",2020-10-07T15:11:21,LABEL_0,0.6922737956047058
post,valorant,2021,rptvbg,"Valorant Needs a Hunger Bar In-Game  In my opinon, valrant is a game. However, as maney of you guys know this game is prety unrelstic, like how brimestone dont got any games on his ipad. One of the most requested ideas in valrant is that riot needs to add a hunger bar. 

This is what hunger bar in valrant would do. First if you dont eat then you get hungrey. After a while then your stomach grumbles so if your hideing in a corner, the enemeys can hear your stomach which reveals your position. Next if you dont eat for a few days in valrant then you die of starvation.

How do you get food thogh? Its prety easy, in all of the maps there is some grass that you can eat. Also if your in a sandy map like BIND then you can eat sand but it doesnt give you that much hunger becuse its sandy. Also your alowed to eat your team mates and enemeys if you kill them.

Overall , hunger bar needs to be add to valrant and would make this game more fun and realstic.

Here is what hunger bar in valrant would look like:
