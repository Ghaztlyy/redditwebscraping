I know she is trash in competitive (because apparently baiting her abilities is exactly how the game is meant to be played) but that doesn’t justify her existence. “Damage” characters don’t belong in a game like valorant.

comment,valorant,2020,fnvavrq,g42u2o,"I feel like Raze is a hold over from when this was likely a different game. Maybe it was more Overwatch-y or CoD-y. They said she was the second character ever designed, which makes me think this.

I like her grenades as area denial/chip damage... if only they functioned that way. Like max 100 damage instead of the full kill it does now. I personally think the roomba is the perfect style of ability as a utility gadget that kills. I think it could definitely be a recon bolt instead but honestly I like the roomba in its entirety. The satchels I don't like because of the flashy quake style of gameplay it brings. Maybe if it were a single hop instead of being able to double jump. Or make it her signature, 1 charge that recharges on kills.

The ULT is unsaveable. Easy nerf to 7 ticks to earn, aggressively lower the kill radius. In a game about out aiming and out positioning your opponent why does this fucking thing exist?

Raze is a very ""easy"" design imo. It's very easy to design a character that explodes shit in a game about shooting shit. It's like a basic archetype of shooters, big boom. But just because we can doesn't mean we should rito.

There will definitely be a number of balance patches before the beta is over. Sage and Cypher are very very strong, and Raze is just a butt to play against.",2020-04-19T16:53:26,LABEL_0,0.4758640229701996,neutral,0.6677412986755371

If you use HWMonitor (in my case) Vanguard disables the reading for the voltages, CPU temps (and other temperature reading stuff on your motherboard) and other things.

Riot needs to do something about their anti-cheat. This is not going to work in the long run. One of the things they should do is that the anti-cheat only should run when you are launching the game (like other anti-cheat software does) and it should be turned off when the game is not running.

comment,valorant,2020,fpodkc3,gek5rm,"Vanguard is blocking the input from my keyboard and mouse. I had to boot into BIOS > enable secure mode boot so Vanguard wouldn't load on boot and only then would the input from my mouse and keyboard be brought back. I confirmed Vanguard to be the issue by uninstalling Vanguard in secure boot, booting without secure mode and seeing I once again had input. I then reinstalled Vanguard, restarted my PC (still outside secure boot) only to have the input of my mouse and keyboard once again be disabled upon restart with Vanguard enabled. What the fuck is going on? Can literally not play the game or use my PC outside of secure boot as it stands.

For info I have a Logitech G Pro Wireless and K65.

Edit: I can confirm removing the interception driver allowed me to regain input of my mouse and keyboard while Vanguard is active. /u/RiotArkem said they would announce if they would disallow Kovaaks from being used together with Valorant but they've said nothing so this is incredibly frustrating, even more so since they for whatever reason decided *not* to have mouse acceleration inside the client so I'm literally forced to use a 3rd party application.

comment,valorant,2020,fpi22yw,gdl3es,"Really good, reminds me a lot of OW ranks.  

One thing I'm not sure about is simply having the ult dots represent subrank divisions, it's certainly very clear, but it doesn't really feel a ""part"" of the actual rank icon.  I noticed there's a diamond space in the middle for all the ranks, so I wonder about maybe using that?  So at rank 3, you'd have 3 vertically stacked chevrons in the middle (like the singular chevron in your Gold rank), at rank 2, only 2 chevrons, at rank 1 only 1 chevron.  You'd have to redo some of the later ranks apart from valorant, but it could be interesting.  

I also think you have the right idea with the materials, but I think Diamond and Immortal could be a bit more glowy or luminous, especially comparing them to higher ranks in OW like Diamond and Masters.  And of course Valorant would be glowy and have the lightning bolt particle effect.",2020-05-05T06:42:23,LABEL_2,0.7235738039016724,surprise,0.6230269074440002
comment,valorant,2020,fphzxlm,gdl3es,"These are great. One improvement I'd like to see is having Immortal be a bit more flashy though, add on to the shape and volume of it a little more as you did with the Valorant rank.

Since Riot themselves distinguished both Immortal and Valorant from the other ranks in shape, it seems only fitting to have a clear distinction here as well.

Amazing job though, this is well made and contrary to popular belief I'm sure it can give the Riot team which is on the inevitable redesigning of the icons some inspiration.",2020-05-05T06:22:33,LABEL_2,0.8917045593261719,neutral,0.6803542375564575

I just spent the last 3 hours figuring out why I couldn't get into Windows because my keyboard and mouse wouldn't work. Just before that, I started smelling hot plastic - my graphics card was running +90°C because again, Vanguard disabled my cooling software (My PC case got very bad airflow, I have to decrease my GPU performance to keep it cool enough).

Vanguard really needs to prevent us from launching the game while X software is active -and asking us to close it, even if we need to reboot just after- instead of disabling everything silently.

EDIT regarding my GPU: the issue with my graphics card started few days ago but I wasn't able to link it to Vanguard. Since my case was made to hold a GT630, the airflow sucks hard and I made a profile which I always use with target performance at 75% for my GTX970. Less performance, but less heat and then less noise. Few days ago, Asus GPU Tweak gave me ""Error BIOS load failed"" when starting, and my GPU was spinning like crazy in a TFT game. I didn't fry my GPU (but others are claiming so), but it's not comfortable at all for me to have it blowing at fullspeed when playing a TFT game.

&#x200B;

u/RiotArkem got downvoted into hell, so i'll copy/pasta what he said just in case

"" We're working on ways to make the experience better. Our current notification pop-ups aren't as good as they could be and we're looking for ways to give you more control over how Vanguard works.

We're happy to do anything we can to make this smoother for everyone as long as it doesn't give an opening for cheaters.

TL;DR: Expect improvements before launch.""

post,valorant,2020,gdl3es,,"I redesigned the Valorant ranked icons. What do you think? Hi all, I’m a UI/UX designer. My friends and I were very excited for Valorant ranked, and disappointed when we saw the icons. When I heard Shroud complain in one of his videos, I felt the need to give the icons my own hot take.

**Why I felt like the Valorant ranked icons were lacking:**

* Silhouettes are not distinct enough
* Platinum is a rusted copper color
* Immortal and Valorant don’t feel powerful enough
* Tiers are cleverly incorporated into the icons, but it makes every rank feel the same, and not intuitive

**What I tried to achieve in my design:**

* Progression of silhouettes. Each rank grows upon the last
* Intuitive colors that rank up with you
* “Make Immortal and Valorant great again”
* Easy to tell which tier
* Taking advantage of the existing Valorant imagery, such as:
   * Valorant logo
   * Valorant ranked icon
   * Ultimate charge dots
   * Valorant loading screen spark animation

Here is my design:

[Colored](https://preview.redd.it/74o9bevakyw41.png?width=8288&format=png&auto=webp&s=934c467ad9e38045fe2959b26aa5557e31b00e0a)

I reused as many of the original colors as possible. I eventually had to do some tweaking because bronze, gold, immortal used very similar colors. I used Phoenix as inspiration for Immortal, which seems apt, right?

Here’s a mockup of what it would look like in-game (screenshot taken from somewhere on Reddit):

**My design process:**

* Sketching a fuck ton of ideas and researching ranked icons from other video games
* Looking at a lot of Valorant imagery to create a moodboard
* Mocking up icons in Figma (because I’m a UI/UX designer) in grayscale first to create distinct silhouettes
* Adding colors
* Mocking it up on a screenshot to see what it would look like

Overall, took me a day to do. Shout-out to my boyfriend who gave really helpful critiques throughout the process. Hope you all like it!

Edit: I woke up to 12.7k upvotes. Thank you all very much for the enthusiasm and feedback. Solid points and ideas made in the comments.   


Edit edit: 14.4k upvotes-- you guys make me want to go back and try a few things, such as adding embers to Immortal, and tweaking the colors to align more with the matte aesthetic of the UI. I meant for Platinum to feel a different, like a breaking point into high rank. It was a risk, but I personally think the shape is really cool. If this ever were implemented for real, the tier dots might have to be changed for small res.",2020-05-05T05:57:31,LABEL_1,0.54564368724823,neutral,0.6219977140426636

Upvoting for visibility.

EDIT: THE BUG IS NOT FIXED. The implementation of the HUD filter is very buggy and it is clearly mentioned as [beta] in the filter selection list. This is still working on and off with varying degrees of success. Just wanted to clear it up because of all the speculation in the thread on a perceived fix. 

Also as a side note, no bug fix is deployed this quickly in any dev environment, assuming they heard about the bug through this thread, there is little to no chance that a fix has been created, tested and deployed.",2021-06-25T17:19:07,LABEL_0,0.8040453195571899,neutral,0.45260757207870483

comment,valorant,2021,h2z9jav,o7jrgo,"Tried this in the range. Yes, it works. However, you can't see any HUD, what teammates/enemies are alive or dead, can't buy weapons, can't see what abilities you have, and most importantly...you can't see the minimap. Turning on this antiflash makes the game unplayable IMO, but still Riot will have to fix it and are going to have a hell of a job.

Edit: It's been pointed out this can be keybinded. Yes, you can turn it on and off at the click of a button :-( I'd highly recommend not doing this because it's going to be super obvious to the anti-cheat what you're doing...would Riot ban you for an Nvidia filter exploit? Maybe.

comment,valorant,2020,g3zgm89,imgfwo,"Using my stump on the keyboard always feels like a ball rolling on different keys close to each other. Whenever I start playing a new game, I always try to configure most of the keys in a small radius that includes Q-W-E-R-A-S-D-F-Z-X-1-2-3-Shift and Tab. Over the years my nub has developed excellent muscle memory to hit these exact keys without looking.

Moreover, I have the Logitech G402 mouse that has 5 extra buttons on the side that can be configured to whichever keys you want. It gives me incredible control over complex games like Fortnite, Valorant, etc. and I can call myself a semi-pro player!

comment,valorant,2020,fxfymdz,ho5joc,"Hey buddy congrats!

Some useful tips that helped me improve, if you're interested.

Go into the practice mode vs the bots. Practice on easy mode, kill 30 bots as they spawn (you press F3 iirc to change the bot settings while in the target practice area where the bots are) 

Adjust your sensitivity as low as you can comfortably handle it. 

Personally I like 800 dpi and 0.3 sensitivity 

Some players use really high sens but the majority are low sens at the higher ranks, because generally speaking you have less room for error with a LOWER sens especially at med-long ranges. 

Once you can comfortably get 28+ kills on easy mode then switch to medium and try. There is a huge jump in difficulty between easy and med, and between med and hard. So dont get discouraged. There are some days I'll practice vs bots for a couple of hours and not even play ranked matches. They're very important because if you cant kill bots on medium or hard difficulty then you won't be able to kill players at higher ranks either.

To put into perspective, I'm a Plat 2 player currently and I can get 22-25 kills on a good day vs the Hard bots. They're flickshot headshot only, if you dont land the first two bullets the bot disappears and a new one pops up. 

It teaches you muscle memory and quick reaction time. It helps significantly when you have a firm command over your mouse and aim. Learn to stop moving when shooting. Literally just let go of WSAD and then shoot. If you're holding any movement button WSAD and shoot at the same time then your bullets will miss their target. It is highly inaccurate to shoot while moving at all (unless walking in med range or maybe running very close range). 

Practice practice practice. 

Shoot at the walls in the practice mode and see how the gun has a pattern it always follows. Master the recoil pattern until you can get your first 5-10 bullets landing in the same spot or very close. 

You'll realize that at 40+ m range you will need to control your spray and maybe only shoot in 2-3 round bursts. Practice letting go of the fire button right when two or three bullets are shot off. Timing is key here. 

If you try to hold down fire at long range you will miss more often than not. The bot to your right that has a range indicator is useful for practicing this.

Really just use that practice arena and it will improve your gameplay. But it takes hours every week at least because there are players at diamond and higher who spend hours per day practicing.

Make sure your crosshair is highly visible and allows you to land your shots without obstructing your view or being easy to lose sight of. 4 2 2 is very popular for crosshairs among pros. That's 4 length 2 width 2 gap, white, yellow, or cyan with no outline. 

Or if you like outline try 4 2 4 with outline on.

Push yourself to your limits and use your intellect to adapt and figure out how to make the game work for you. Watch lots of videos of players and how they move and shoot.

These are the basics. Once you get this down you'll see a huge improvement in your online gameplay. You'll be more accurate and lose less fire fights.

Then you'll move on to more advanced tactics such as crosshair placement and movement and knowing when to rotate or how to use abilities and when etc... 

Have fun with it and dont get discouraged.",2020-07-10T01:36:09,LABEL_1,0.5024690628051758,neutral,0.863290548324585

comment,valorant,2020,g4d3fpd,ioclkt,"Real reasons why I suck:

* Obviously, bad luck with teammates. Yeah it happens a lot in Bronze.
* I hit feet way more than I hit heads.
* I bought Kovaaks but have no idea what sandbox and training to do which will benefit me. Not exactly a super user-friendly piece of software if you don't know how to use it already.
* I only JUST got a mousepad yesterday and that has made a difference already. Kicking myself for not getting one earlier
* I haven't studied agent-specific abilities for each map enough. I couldn't tell you where the hell to shoot Sova's recon bolt. I just blast that shit and hope for the best.
* Up until recently, I had a comically high mouse sensitivity
* I tend to play at night to chill out, and alcohol is usually involved in that...

In summary: I'm 32 and this is my first video game where I have to do homework and training to get better at.

comment,valorant,2020,g4d30od,ioclkt,"Ima be real with you in this time of memes and jebaited posts.

In most games I am a gold-diamondish player, depending on how much work I put into the game and how motivated I am, but i avoided FPS completely until Valorant (I'm 30 now).

Every time I slump in this game I drop from silver 3/gold 1 to bronze within a few days, and then it may take me 1-2 weeks or literally only 3 games (if im kinda lucky) to get it back. Something that LoL taught me and that is even MORE true in this game is this:

If I tell myself that I am better than my rank, I tilt WAY more. I play worse. I don't think as creatively. I try to play like I'm with gold players, when I'm solo Q'ing in bronze fucking 2. And you know what happens? I eat shit. When we win, I bot frag. When we lose, I top frag but I barely go even KDR.

Every single time i slump, the only thing that gets me out of it is exactly what you said: I have to remind myself that right now I'm a fucking bronze 2 player. It hurts, but once I accept it, I can let go of the frustration and just play. Then literally the next day I usually start hard carrying games because I'm playing the games i'm IN, not the games i WISH i was in.

I lose a lot of confidence when I tilt. I hesitate a lot. I'm not somebody who plays better when I hate my team or I love my team. I'm somebody who plays  better when I don't expect my team to do a goddamn thing, and I do whatever I personally have to do to win (LoL taught me that).

TL;DR: As long as I'm trying to be better than I am currently playing, I'm actually gonna play worse. Save the personal skill analysis for after the game. While in the game, dedicate all of your energy to ""What can I do?"" Acknowledging my suck and my teammates' suck like ""this is just the way it is. cant change it. cant worry about it"" = I play WAY better. I hope you can do the same <3

You'll get out of bronze if you stay humble. I BELIEVE!

**Edit: I'm getting some weird misunderstanding comments, so I wanted to add this:**

I never said in Valorant I'm a gold-diamond player. ! I said in some games I was gold/plat/diamond equivalent, which I have been each across many different games. The point you guys are making against me, is actually my entire point: that just because you're good at one game or good sometimes doesn't mean you're entitled to the rank you think you should have. While I've alrady reached gold multiple times in this game, I lack experience and consistency with the game to currently maintain it, and sometimes I just play super bad. It happens. That's the whole point of my post

Two people already have started trying to flame me and made the exact same misunderstanding, so i decided to edit this post.",2020-09-08T02:51:21,LABEL_0,0.5622910261154175,neutral,0.49078676104545593

comment,valorant,2021,h6uogsd,ote9sx,"A couple of years ago we decided there should be a better way for players to find CS:GO teammates. Since then, we’ve had fun learning and competing in Valorant.

We all know what it’s like to play ranked and want to help everyone avoid toxicity. So, after months of work… We’re launching TEAMS.gg for Valorant. - [https://teams.gg/valorant](https://teams.gg/valorant)

Whether you’re looking for an Immortal DuoQ partner or a 5-stack to ride out of ELO hell together - hopefully this will help us all avoid Jett insta-locks and find a group of friends to play with 😊

**Edit: So many of you have created profiles that there is a large queue on the Valorant API now. If your rank/stats don't appear straight away. Don't worry, they will appear in time. This may also mean that you see fewer people in Discover to begin with (if you're looking for specific ranks) while we wait for everyone's ranks to appear.**",2021-07-29T01:10:50,LABEL_2,0.5778993368148804,neutral,0.89119952917099

comment,valorant,2020,fuox71o,h81o1f,"to be fair; they arent recolors, they are new models of these guns. but youre right, the fact that the 71€ pack doesnt come with all the level ups included but must be purchased ADDITIONALLY with incredibly expensive radiant points is a joke. i did some quick maths and came up with this:

* **\~71€** for the pack  
* all skins combined need **4x (30 R + 45 R)** to complete all level ups, thats 300R total
* the pass yields **170 R** so an additional **11€** to the **71€**, so **82€**
* so we need another **130 R** to unlock the remaining level and the cheapest way to purchase them is with buy them for **9200 V** and the cheapest way to get THOSE are purchasing **5500 V** and **4400 V** respectively for the low prive of **98€**

**IN CONCLUSION:**  
in order to get ALL THE THINGS in the skin pack you have to spend **AT LEAST 180€**

post,valorant,2020,h81o1f,,"$71 Skin Bundles Shouldn’t Be A Thing The skins in this game look fantastic, but really $71 for 5 colored skins. You can get a brand new AAA game like Cyberpunk for example plus a season pass for a game with so much content or you know 5 recolors for guns...

And that’s all they practically are recolors except the knife, the only way to give them cool animations and sound/lighting effects is to throw even more money into the specific skins themselves, sooo much money for a few skins. 

Please Valorant so many people want to buy skins but not for over the price of a brand new AAA game.

comment,valorant,2020,g0cv6s3,i3oq28,"Hi thanks for checking it out!

This was my first time modelling a project for a build, it came out well. I started modelling it immediately after the Valorant beta dropped so its got a few inaccuracies, but besides that, the model is life sized (A little over a meter long.) it has a removable mag with a few defused rounds on top for flavor, the holo-sight attaches via magnets, and lights up a piece of acrylic to replicate that glowing sight when you ADS in game.

comment,valorant,2020,fsihhnj,guewve,"Can we start a comment thread for popular ""slang"" from CS that new players to Valorant should know about?

Rotate - essentially means move to a different location, often to a different bomb site. 

Trade - two players have had a fight, one has died. Getting a trade means you (a third player) are getting the easy kill on the weakened player who was left alive from the initial fight.

CT - the defenders spawn.

T - the attackers spawn

AWP - the gun known as Operator in Valorant

AK - the gun known as Vandal in Valorant

Bomb - known as a spike in Valorant

Deagle - the gun known as the Sheriff

If anyone else can think of any, post 'em up!

Eco round - a round where you are low on money, so this round you don't spend anything, and then next round you will have enough money for a full buy.

Force/full buy - a round where everyone on your team is to spend as much money as possible to get the best equipment and increase your chances of winning

Boost - use an ability to help a teammate get height over a ledge or onto something

Dink - a headshot

Lurk - a lone player who creeps around the opposite side of the map to his team, trying to catch enemy players off guard

Peek - moving your character into a position where an enemy player is already looking, or likely to be looking

Edit:
 Double doors - any room or area of the map that has two large doors as an entrance/exit",2020-06-01T18:10:43,LABEL_1,0.6513582468032837,neutral,0.7894200682640076

I enjoy playing OP on ascent holding from tree/cat with an OP because there aren’t any flashes that will make me back off, and most players I face don’t quite know how to peek that angle quick without dying. 
In order to learn how to play that angle though, I also learned how to counter it, which is to abuse the instant accuracy when you let go of any movement key.

The reason CS has thrived for soooo long is not simply because of community maps, but community content in general. Outside maps and skin design, community servers are what keep even older CS games alive today. Having different game modes born because of the freedom the source engine give.

The Range is nice, but it's still too restrictive in comparison to what aim_botz offers. When practicing my spray, I find it annoying to have to shoot the clear button when I can layer bind it to another button. (aim_botz has it automatically but I bind r_cleardecals to some of my nades and inspects too).",2020-07-13T02:15:49,LABEL_1,0.4507877230644226,neutral,0.4816766083240509
comment,valorant,2020,fxuc8qh,hpwcho,Number 3 is probably my biggest problem about the game rn. Riot is trying so hard to monetize the game and it really shows. I remember just months ago when CS had a map making contest and two of the top maps were added to the game. Not to mention countless community maps that pros currently use for practice before tournaments. There are even fun coop adventure maps that were created to replicate Skyrim. All of these were made possible through the workshop which I would consider Steams greatest strength.,2020-07-13T00:43:18,LABEL_1,0.45159730315208435,neutral,0.6720103621482849

comment,valorant,2020,fq68xlb,gh453l,"This is currently written in Python, and designed in a way that I can just change a few csv files and it can be used for other Agents as well.   My next step is going to be to recreate this within a web application,  because that allows for dynamic updates of the locations and easier access.

Edit: To give credit where it is due, here is the font I used: [https://www.reddit.com/r/VALORANT/comments/g0747t/valorant\_font/](https://www.reddit.com/r/VALORANT/comments/g0747t/valorant_font/)

Edit 2: I will be releasing the github project tomorrow, working out the last few things for the first release

Edit 3: There seem to be a few people asking why it just shows pictures.  There will be links to YouTube clips for each setup.  But once you learn the setup, you will most likely need a small refresher on what the exact lineup is, you dont need to watch the full clip again to see the setup.  That's the point of the pictures.  This thread has given some really good feedback and ideas for the application, and I will definitely be turning this into a website as well as it should have been.

&#x200B;

Edit 4: Due to a lot of demand, I am releasing this a little early.  Please read the full Github page, and if you have any suggestions or problems, please post them in the issues section of the Github page.  If it is a feature recommendation, please give it the 'Enhancement' label.  This is still a work in progress and I guarantee you that by the end of the week, I will have all 3 maps up, and support for other Agents.

Because they have to take in all the abilities its a struggle i guess, but all the maps are all the same. 1 long entry and 1 choke point to a side. Defenders can always peek first.

Starts off with 4 Jetts one Brim, every time a Jett dies they switch to Brim. Might be hard/impossible for 1 brim to kill a Jett with ult tho, at least within a few minutes. Maybe just Raze.

Hopefully we will get a custom deathmatch or ideally a more general customizable game mode. Unfortunately I highly doubt it.

comment,valorant,2020,fyebzcf,ht0qj7,"I like using the Viper Ult in the center of where the bots spawn in the shooting range, setting the bots to move, and then hopping into the Ult with them and moving around and shooting them.

The target acquisition feels a lot more natural as most of the time they spawn out of your range of vision and you have to move to be able to see them, which gets you to practice moving and shooting outside of the standard strafing back and forth some people will do when warming up. Sometimes they spawn outside of the ult, which allows you to practice peeking through utility. You also benefit from improving your ability to locate the enemy based off of sound.",2020-07-18T04:44:25,LABEL_2,0.7748727202415466,neutral,0.870793879032135

post,valorant,2020,hpwcho,,"The Current OP Meta is a Result of all of Valorant's Combined Flaws. Hey guys, I'm a 10 year CS player here. Previously played at Level 9 Faceit and A - ESEA. Have probably 1000+ hours of watching pro games under my belt, and even more spent in KZ and HnS servers. I love Valorant, and I love a lot of what they're trying to do with this game in comparison to CS. But, I think the current OP meta is a result of almost every short coming the game has right now (for the most part).

Firstly, I think it's important to preface this by saying that Valorant is 100% by design, made to be easier / more approachable than CS:GO. You can see this in almost every aspect of the game. If it's something that was intimidating to new players in CS, it's been massively simplified here. Spray patterns are far less aggressive. Lineups have been almost entirely eliminated, or completely streamlined. Movement speed has been reduced to allow for easier tracking and aiming. Counter-strafing has been forgotten and replaced by instant momentum. Even the slight advantage you got from good movement (brought along by thousands of hours of practice in CS:GO) has been entirely eliminated by a massive simplification of movement in general, as well as how severe tagging is. I'm not saying these are negative aspects of the game. I understand almost if not all of these changes. Tons of these choices succeed in their desired goal, and it's lead to tons of my friends enjoying this game despite never getting more than 4 games into CS.

With all that said tho, lots of these choices indirectly feed into the current OP meta.

I don't say this lightly either. If you were to directly compare the AWP and the OP, the AWP is hands down 3x more powerful than the OP currently is.

It boasts :

* More ammo overall, and more ammo per clip.
* Instantaneous ADS, and instantaneous Accuracy after scoping in. (though this is more a trait of all scoped weapons in CS:GO)
* Better hip-fire accuracy.
* Higher ROF
* More forgiving movement accuracy

//Thanks to u/IAmNotOnRedditAtWork for pointing some of these out as they escaped me

I have a shortish video on this, with some old community server / lower level faceit games. It's presented as more of a frag movie than anything so there's no need to watch it, but I do think it can offer some important context when talking about how insane the AWP actually is for high level players.

I've edited it to have specific time stamps in the description so that you can jump between the clips that are actually relevant to this discussion. Turn down volume as there is music and I'm sure its obnoxious. [Here you go](https://youtu.be/pOV2nbWDYro)

Despite the obvious advantages the AWP has, we don't really see it being as prevalent and oppressive as we do in Valorant. We do not see double AWP and Triple AWP rounds being NEAR as viable as they are here, with triple AWP rounds being almost nonexistent.

I chalk this up to quite a few things :

&#x200B;

* Movement speed. I think this is discounted quite a bit by nearly everyone. But people fail to realize how big of a deal this really is. I don't think I need to elaborate on this too much. But I think it's important to highlight ""punishing"" an AWPer. Typically, in CS you're only going to punish an AWPer if they miss their shot. Sure you can smoke them off or flash them, but typically at a high level they'll be playing in a position where it's easy to fall back and avoid being traded if they do get flashed off their angle, that is until you're on site. (Also important to note that not all AWPers play aggressive at lower levels). If it's mathematically easier to hit shots in Valorant, you bet your ass this is having an overall effect on how consistent this weapon can perform. It also (purposefully) eliminates the usefulness of jiggle peeking or baiting shots, which is a massive part of counter-play in CS. I'm not saying they should increase movement speed. I just think pointing this out is healthy for understanding and discussing this topic as a whole.

&#x200B;

* Movement Speed pt. 2. On top of movement speed in Valorant being much lower, many CS players will probably tell you that the way in which you move in Valorant is instantaneous. There is no counter strafing, and as a result, if you were to stand still, and then start running, you reach your max velocity almost immediately, if not immediately. This is the same in reverse. You lose your momentum the second you let go off WASD, your momentum being what brings about innaccuracy. This allows the OP to be hyper aggressive in situations where it shouldn't be. Period. You can hold an angle, whiff your shot, and then repeek that same angle aggressively all because you have no aim penalty within a time frame where your aggression should be punishable. In CS:GO the max velocity is higher, and the acceleration has a longer time between min and max. This makes it so that repeeking an angle has a window of innaccuracy that is PARAMOUNT in balancing for a weapon like this. The OP in Valorant currently has little counter-play outside of maybe DDoSing your opponent and hoping they miss shots.'

&#x200B;

* Utility. This isn't a secret. Most the player-base is probably aware in some form that this is having an effect on the meta. On top of there being very little vision limiting utility (smokes), I think the lack of counter play regarding flashes is also an issue. In CS, it's usually quite easy to see a flash coming, and depending on your weapon and/or position, either turn and avoid the flash, or to turn and run entirely. Sometimes if it's a pop flash you'll tank it and pray you don't die. But in Valorant, the flashes are very very quick to pop, and they last almost no time at all. You can't act off your own flash at all on most angles, and ton's of choke points require you to walk a distance where the flash is entirely negated anyway. For instance, Ascent A site. If you flash from main the distance between main and site is large enough that most people holding close aren't going to be flashed by the time you're pushed up. So maybe you get the AWPer off the long angle they're holding, and then you start pushing only for the person holding close to take contact and have the AWPer peek back out. This is why we see Phoenix being so viable in TSM's lineup. Flashing out smokes gives the entire team the biggest possible window in order to act on that utility. It's basically equivalent to a pop flash in CS, and also allows you to have more control over where you're flashing onto a site. So you can flash and pop out of the smoke much quicker than if you were around a corner, and you can also flash much deeper into a choke point then you'd normally be able to. That said, this is not a direct counter to OP meta. It's just an issue with flashes I've noticed, and a sort of ""work around"" I've seen take center stage.

And this kinda brings me to my next issue. And probably the one we all should have expected.

&#x200B;

* Map design. Outside of most the maps feeling incredibly linear, and despite them feeling like Hallway simulator 2020. I think there's another issue in relation to thoughtful map design. One of the things I mentioned above was how certain elements were streamlined, in relation to utility mainly. This, in my opinion, also relates to the map design.

CS has very tried and true bits of utility at play. Smokes, Mollies, and Flashes. When you play CS at a level where executes are necessary, it's actually quite fascinating to learn how each map has been designed with utility constantly in mind. Cache B site for instance, there's a window directly above site meant for throwing utility. Mirage A has a massive area above ramp for throwing util. Inferno Apts even has fucking windows on the opposite side of site, with a chimney adjacent to them in order for you to bank utility off of. Dust 2 recently underwent a change in B tuns to allow for more utility and site executes given how hard the site was too take control of. Whether it be on attacks or retakes. Valorant has streamlined ""utility"" so much, that they've forgotten the exact reason why it was implemented in the way that it was in CS:GO, and why it worked so well. Valorant has thrown thoughtful map design out the window in favor of meaningless gimmicks that fall flat after your 5th game on the map.

Guess what Riot, I don't care about opening and closing destructible doors, or ropes that give you a surprising amount of velocity and accuracy while attached, and definitely not 3 fucking sites. I play ranked games where my opponents go 3-14 and then start fragging out when they decide to whip out the OP. The gun is too easy to use and it sports almost zero counter-play. IT IS AN ISSUE. I understand not jumping the gun and rushing towards some half ass balancing decision, but you've been so quick to address smaller issues that didn't actively suck the fun out of the game and reward players for using an obvious crutch.

// People have pointed out some poor phrasing on my part here, would just like to iterate that I'm not against these kinds of gimmicks, they have a place and I don't mean to undermine anyone who enjoys them. I just think these gimmicks are being used in place of good map design. Sort of a ""sure ascent is a terrible map but here are some doors you can open and close, this one has ropes!""

Ascent is the closest map to CS design we currently have in Valorant in my opinion, and it still ignores most of what made those maps work in the first place. Scrap the gimmicks. Nobody wants this random shit. I want maps with intelligent design choices, meaningful spots for fair trades at the beginning of rounds, I want maps designed with rotates in mind and counter-play at heart. You can tell CS maps are designed with all the games utility in mind. I'm constantly reminded that I can't say the same about any of Valorant's maps.

With that being said, what are some ways to fix these issues?

&#x200B;

1. Add a slight time frame with the OP that adds inaccuracy after moving, keep this outside of movement speed, have it be its own value. For instance, if you scope in with the OP, then strafe to the side and stop moving, add an extra .5 or whatever amount of time where there is still an innaccuracy debuff applied. OPs are meant for holding angles, they are already ridiculously good at that in this game. Punish them for playing aggressive.
2. Phoenix's flash needs a slight ""rework"" to come more into line with vision blocking utility in relation to cutting off angles. Phoenix's flash shouldn't pop so quickly. I think it sports niche usability with little counter-play. When throwing out Phoenix's flash, have it hover in air at the very end of it's duration while giving it an obvious ""charge-up"" animation, give a larger (but still small) window in order to either back off an angle, or to turn your back too it, and then have it pop, and increase the time frame in which you're flashed slightly. I also considered having Phoenix be invulnerable to his flash, as a way to give Phoenix a way to more reliably entry, while still forcing him to play slightly outside of his team in these situations, (or risk flashing them). This promotes playing anti flash and/or less predictable and maybe even more dangerous positions in order to deny Phoenix this ground when he attempts to entry. I think it adds a reasonable amount of counter play in a game that severely lacks it currently, I think it gives Phoenix some needed independence and room to make these types of solo plays, while also letting an agent specifically gain ground around OPers. I think a good way to envision this is Ascension A site. Instead of OPing heaven when you know Phoenix likes to flash in from main and push you off your angle, you can play on site to the left, and play anti flash in order to kill him when he attempts to entry. Diagram [Here](https://ibb.co/NL9g8WW)
3. LET YOUR COMMUNITY DESIGN MAPS FOR YOU. For the love of god the fact that I even have to say this makes me angry. Community interaction has lead to CS being the powerhouse of an E-sport it is today. Volcano's involvement is proof of this. No one is saying you have to add them as actual competitive maps, but acting like you can produce better content than your entire community is ridiculously naive when you've already shown that's NOT the case. Add some kind of community tool for your players to design maps, and have some kind of game mode that rotates these featured community maps every couple of months or something. Even if it's just to give the team at Riot ideas and inspiration. I was worried months ago when you said you weren't going to allow even the most basic of community creativity in this regard. It's okay to be wrong Riot. Valve was smart enough to realize the community could carry some of that workload, while also teaching them and giving them inspiration. Volcano is on your dev team because of this reality.",2020-07-12T23:39:36,LABEL_2,0.561060905456543,neutral,0.924018144607544

post,valorant,2020,hwcxvo,,"I'd rather have more Maps than Agents Just some guy's dumb opinion but, I would personally love to see more maps than agents in this game. I'd much prefer have one new map per episode or act or whatever than an agent. Because I feel like with the current 11 we have right now, they all already have unique abilities and playstyles to keep people busy without craving for a new one, whereas the maps however, at least for me, I'm getting so fricking tired of playing in Haven for the fifth time in a row. Plus, me personally I am REALLY interested in the lore of this game would love to see more of the world. It's not a complaint, more of a suggestion. Thanks 4 readin

P.S. I understand that creating maps is much more time consuming and challenging on the devs part, so to compensate, another solution would just be to let the community create maps and just pick the best one using like a contest or something and the winner gets to have a free dragon skin or something. Just a suggestion.
