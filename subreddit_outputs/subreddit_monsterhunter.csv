Distilling some commonly-answered questions in this comment:

\-""Is that actual slow-motion?"" Yes, I'm using a slow-motion soft-mod for this clip. The moment where I dunk Bazel is actually the ""real-time"" part of the clip. Everything else is sped up to match normal gameplay speeds.

\-""Over 1000 damage on a Bazelgeuse head without heroics?"" Those damage numbers I achieved are possible in-game. The setup for it is ridiculous though. You need max spiribirds with the demon petalace, all attack boosting items, peak performance lvl 3, white sharpness, and the elemental boost melody/infernal melody from HH.

\-""How long did this take?"" 4 hours of failure. Bazel tends to do his ultimate when not heated up...so I didn't have a lot of chances to practice the dunk timing with his better hit zone available.

\-""Bonk?"" Bonk.",2021-07-09T11:31:56,LABEL_1,0.5057899951934814,neutral,0.7507247924804688

Just wanted to highlight this, so people can know that not only the director is bad at making movies, but also a scummy person who puts money first, people lives second.

comment,monsterhunter,2024,lqhx4jm,1fwwl4h,"First of all, **awesome** work.

It is unique enough not to overlap into other weapon themes, it promotes the use of the lesser widespread Blunt type of damage and most importantly it has a focus on its gameplay, you want to combo your blows in unique combinations to properly balance your Phial resource.

I would like to share some insights regarding how I see the special moves coming in actual play:

* The **BIG BOOM**, I get it, I am a Gunlance user at heart, and nothing fills it with more joy than a huge Wyvern Fire to the face of the nearest monster. However 6 seconds is a rather long time to be standing still for a single move on an action packed fight. Fortunatelly, it seems this number came from the amount of Phials used on the attack (2 seconds for every pair x3 = 6 sec). You may want to reduce the number to something like 1,5 sec per pair of Phials. That way you still have a huge pay off in about 4,5 seconds, which would be at least closer the the Wyvern Fire example above.
* All of the moves that involve using the R button have a rather unique identity, except for the Left and Right Haymakers. Since each costs a single Phial of their respective type, maybe you could add something to differentiate them instead of being the same move done with a different hand. As a few examples, you could consider moving the offset attack to the Red (Circle) haymaker to have a defensive move and put a Shoryuken on the Green (Triangle) Haymaker, to give you more tools to work with against flying enemies instead of relying on the Leap which uses both types of Phials.
* Talking about the Leap, you could also go one step beyond and make it able to be charged for increased distance or increased damage Skullcrusher moves.

In any case, I find your weapon really compelling and would 100% test it if I had the chance.  
Best of luck, and happy hunting.",2024-10-06T02:47:51,LABEL_2,0.5405735373497009,joy,0.5295143127441406
