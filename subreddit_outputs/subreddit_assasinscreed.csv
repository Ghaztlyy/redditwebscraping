I like just running around however, and I also really like the Rope Launcher since you can weave it smoothly in you freeruns and get back up quickly if you failed a jump (well, if this game had a jump button anyway).",2024-12-18T04:25:25,LABEL_2,0.7587270736694336,neutral,0.8009951710700989

Top it off with being generally buggy and having a poor pc port, there's really nothing that elevates it above any other entry in the series. It's middling at best IMO. Perfectly okay to like it, it's subjective after all.",2024-12-18T10:03:46,LABEL_0,0.815617024898529,disgust,0.907264232635498
