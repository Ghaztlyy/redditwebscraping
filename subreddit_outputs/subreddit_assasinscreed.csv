post,assasinscreed,2024,1g005dm,"Replaying the series again! Here's my tier list, thoughts? They are also in order from left to right within the tiers, so Odyssey is my #1 (yea controversial i know, but im in love with Greek Mythology IRL and RPG's are my favorite genre, so i was basically the perfect target demo lol) & AC1 is my #12 (story was good but the gameplay just felt way too repetitive, a remake could potentially see it bumped up in between Unity & Rogue if done right).

*I have played a small part of revelations back in the day but 14 year old me could NOT beat that carriage chase. I really need to go back and try again, I loved 2 & Brotherhood so much. Always bothered me that I never finished Ezio's story...",2024-10-10T03:40:32,LABEL_2,0.6221863627433777

post,assasinscreed,2024,1hei3jh,"I finished ac unity... The story was pretty flat but good. The Parkour was so good and the flashy moves arno does to get down was very cool. The world was built very well for parkour, tightly knitted buildings, ropes to cross distant buildings I rarely no infact I don't remember dropping down to cross. It is pretty annoying to get down to cross two buildings in the new ac games.

Since I played mirage and unity side by side the difference was huge. I missed the double assissnation in mirage. The Parkour felt very lively compared to mirage. Imo arno got the best drip.

Paris was very beautifuly crafted all the churches and the poity thingðŸ¤Œ. It is as they say one of the best looking ac games. Tho for me origins followed by unity.

Gameplay was okayish or they could have done better since I finished syndicate first i felt alot of elements missing(sling shot was not one of them) The absence of quick access wheel made it a bit chaotic.

The game was unfinished felt rushed to me. But regardless hands down one of the best AC game.",2024-12-15T09:44:36,LABEL_2,0.6906848549842834
