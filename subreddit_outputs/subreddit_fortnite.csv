- Ramirez came back as a ghost! CALL THE GHOSTBUSTER

- Dennis thinks Ramirez is not ghost boss material, shoot the ghost with the gun.

- Ramirez is dead! Feed her ashes to a smasher so the devs won't be able to bring her back!

post,fortnite,2020,hiqq0o,,"#SaveSaveTheWorld Hey there fellow commanders. Well, 2020 continues to be awful doesn't it? The world is on fire IRL, and Epic has officially thrown in the towel for our beloved game mode so we cant even pretend to Save the World.

This news is heartbreaking to us as a mod team as we all love not only STW as a game mode but also this community and what all of us together have created here. Without each of you this community wouldn't be what it is. We truly wish that the game leaving Early Access was going to herald some new awesome changes for players experiencing the game for the first time as well as all of us who have been here to watch the game change since July 2017 when it first launched into Early Access. Unfortunately it appears the Storm has won and that isn't in the cards. Devastated by this news doesn't even begin to describe our feelings at this point.

While we are players first we are still moderators and want to talk about how this sub will work going forward.

Effective immediately will be relaxing the rules on this sub - the entire rules page will be updated in the next few days, but for right now here is what you can expect us to still moderate consistently:

* NSFW content
* Personal attacks
* Buying/Selling things
* Scams

Pretty much anything else is fair game for now as long as its related to Fortnite STW in some way. Memes? Go for it. LFG? Find people if you can. With that said this is a hastily thrown together list - if we see stuff that is against Reddit's site rules and/or just does not need to be here, we may still remove it. 

In short we understand you are upset, but remember to still be nice and respectful to each other. 

Good luck Commanders, wherever you are.
