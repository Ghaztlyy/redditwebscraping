post,dota2,2020,ganyoe,"the amount of sexual harassment I receive as a female dotA player is abhorrent Over 2,500 hours on dota. Played 3 pub games today and in every one after using my mic/revealing myself as a female there was a creep. In my last game I had a guy harassing me for tit pics (and then when I refused he started demanding how much I weigh, because ""with my voice I had to be over 200lbs or a man with hairy tits."") lovely, right? That is one voice line from 3 games of hearing this shit. I'm fucking over it. the kicker? not a single teammate spoke up or told the douchenozzles to knock it off. this is a community issue. sexual harassment should NOT be tolerated and there needs to be more severe punishment for this vs feeding or afking. 

I am losing my love for this game and the community.

post,dota2,2021,m0suug,"I am retiring from Dota 2 Wiki. Here's what that means for the community. I'm Lemon, head admin of [Dota 2 Wiki](http://dota2.gamepedia.com/Dota_2_Wiki). For the last 9 years, I've been keeping the wiki updated (with much help from /u/Bu3nyy and others). But I haven't played Dota for many years now, and simply don't have time to keep doing this. So I'm retiring.

Luckily, over the last few years Buny has taken over game mechanics updates, while I still update the hats, events, lore, TI, and generally anything that's not gameplay mechanics. So after I leave, **the cosmetics database will stop being updated**. Pages for events like [Aghanim's Labyrinth](https://dota2.gamepedia.com/Aghanim%27s_Labyrinth) will no longer be made, at least not by me. 

Buny has said he will keep updating game mechanics for the time being, so don't worry if you only care about hero balance changes. But if anyone wants to help with the other stuff, read on:

#The Cosmetics Database

The [cosmetics database](https://dota2.gamepedia.com/Cosmetic_Item) is currently 100% up to date (12,294 articles). I've made a page for every single hat and HUD item in the game, except for a few temporary event items. All hats have previews in the form of videos, gifs, or screenshots. All significant customizations (effects, animations, icons, sounds, styles) have been checked and listed on the wiki.

This has taken well over 1000 hours over the years, even with a Python script. Arcanas and complicated treasures can take 3~4 hours, even with my familiar routine/setup. Each summer's TI cosmetics take up to 100 hours. Because of the time needed, I don't really expect anyone to keep updating the hat database. And tbh, no one else has really shown an interest in doing it since the game came out. 

If you want to try and update it, just look at any similar page and copy the templates, then fill in each parameter. General information on every item is found in items_game.txt (the schema). To find the full customizations list for making tables, check the schema & the file in Dota Workshop Tools (the in-game displays are sometimes incomplete or incorrect). Icons and sounds are extracted from .pak files. Basic knowledge of Mediawiki markup is nice. Exact spelling of everything is required or things will break. Use the source editor, visual edits suck.

Programs I use: 

* ValveResourceViewer to extract game files (schema, icons, etc)
* Dota Workshop Tools to check custom animations lists & capture some effects/models  
* Notepad++ to parse patch notes/mass find & replace
* OBS Studio to record videos
* Adobe After Effects & Premiere to edit/crop videos
* Photoshop for animated gifs/screenies

#Event Pages
Event pages like [The International](https://dota2.gamepedia.com/The_International_10_Battle_Pass), [Diretide](https://dota2.gamepedia.com/Diretide_2020) or [The Underhollow](https://dota2.gamepedia.com/The_Underhollow) are not hard to make, they just require time and good organization of information. I try to use as many tables as possible, new headings whenever necessary, and short sentences in point form so things are understandable at a glance.

If you make a page for a future event, don't write long rambling paragraphs that nobody will read. Extract icons from game files so it doesn't look like a wall of plain text, then arrange as much info in tables as you can.

#The Lore Database

The [lore database](https://dota2.gamepedia.com/Lore) has about 650 articles, and represents maybe 10% of Dota 2's lore. The idea was to make a wiki page for every character, god, place, species, artifact, concept -- every tiny little thing that's mentioned even once in hero biographies, hat flavor text, comics, trailers, event lore, Underlords, Artifact, etc. This was a HUGE fantasy project and I basically gave up after a few hundred hours.

I've gone over most of the older hero bios/voice lines/item flavor texts, but never started on the comics, Underlords cards, let alone the upcoming anime. Adding references after every sentence and writing the same info on multiple related pages turned to be super tedious, so I don't expect people to do it that seriously (but it would be nice).

If you want to help complete it, try to look at the way the existing pages are done, and just copy the page & fill in the blanks. The templates are simple and easy to use. Reference tags are strongly recommended and work just like the ones on Wikipedia. 

#Others
Miscellaneous work on articles like Patches, [Versions](https://dota2.gamepedia.com/Game_Versions), Dota Plus, Shards, [Chat Wheel](https://dota2.gamepedia.com/Chat_Wheel), [Medals](https://dota2.gamepedia.com/Matchmaking/Seasonal_Rankings), [Trophies](https://dota2.gamepedia.com/Trophy), [Emoticons](https://dota2.gamepedia.com/Emoticons), etc. [List here](https://dota2.gamepedia.com/Template:SystemNav). Most of these don't require big frequent updates and should be easy for anyone to do, just change or add a few things to the existing tables.

#Goodbye
It's been a great 9 years with the Dota 2 community, and I've had many tense 90-min matches where I really had to go pee but couldn't let down my team so I just used an old yogurt bucket under my bed while waiting to respawn. There was also much in-game flaming over my unorthodox jungle Sniper strategy (uwu). But that's okay, I forgive you all <3

/u/Bu3nyy is now the head admin in charge of Dota 2 Wiki. I've transferred everything over to him. Please direct all future complaints to the Bunbun.

Thanks everybody. Goodbye.

Edit: Thanks for the appreciation everyone! If anyone wants to donate a few bucks to me, there's a link on the wiki's [Twitter profile](https://twitter.com/dota2wiki). I am really poor and will use it for dental work ;_;

Edit 2: Wow, thanks for all the recognition & gold & donations everybody! It's really gonna help me out. I'm going to bed now, so goodnight and thanks again to all, and I hope the best for the future of the Dota 2 community.",2021-03-09T07:12:37,LABEL_1,0.5376672148704529

post,dota2,2020,hip4ou,"It is time to expose DOTA2 cheats and for Valve to make an effort. Patches updating. People blinded by the excitement and spending altogether millions and millions of dollars. Occasionally you may find yourself asking sometimes when you lose a game: ""Skywrath is scripting"",""Meepo is scripting"", ""Tinker can't possibly spam all spells and items that fast"". And all you think is that you should report that bastard and ease yourself with your own theory that 1 out of 10 games, there is at least one cheater. No my friend, ***what if I told you that 10 out of 10 games, there is always someone cheating?*** I Am expecting that every time i'm playing right now.

Because cheats are still available as before and you can actually spend just a mere ***2 dollar*** for a **whole weeks** access to cheat your way through in Dota2. What is this cheat i'm talking about? This page is currently only in russian language. With a little help of automatic google translate, I could easily find out where to press the buttons and finally found myself in the buying section.

I Also found out that there is around 70 000 members in that page (Source in swedish according to my own language google translation:  [https://imgur.com/gallery/DQqmaLh](https://imgur.com/gallery/DQqmaLh) ) and they probably all had access to dota scripts. According to [dota.rgp.io](https://dota.rgp.io) , Russian and Europe servers are always dominating with at least 14 000 active players at the same time ***(If you are not playing in EU West or East, you wouldn't know that Russian Server is always first and best option with lowest ping).*** Therefore, have you ever felt like you played with cheaters, that feeling must have been spot on. My guess is that Russian and European servers are very corrupt.

Out of respect to the community, I do **not** want to expose the name of the developers because it also means **you** having access from the moment you are reading this post. So I will try my best to prevent you from exploiting it because it's simply not that worth it. AND if you are possibly working with valve or anything, I will gladly share the source in private. If you, as a dota player, feel the urge to find this cheat, even if i'm trying to avoid that, then I say good luck and I hope it is the answer to all of your hopes of becoming a better dota player but believe me;

**It is not.** You will also get virus warnings and maybe you will also contribute to Valve making an effort to shut this script down.

[https://imgur.com/gallery/brx3Pml](https://imgur.com/gallery/brx3Pml)

[https://imgur.com/gallery/2HwnlLx](https://imgur.com/gallery/2HwnlLx)

And to answer your questions already now: YES I tried this cheat for a month, just to make sure I know what this is about and I can tell you once again that the cheat script is definitely not making you a better player. I never received any ban during this time as an active Dota 2 player since 2012. Honestly, if I got banned, I would have been more happy cause then I know that Valve can actually detect cheats. There is scripts for many heroes included in this application. You can guess it: Yes you press one button and spam combos for heroes like Tinker, Skywrath, Kunkka, Phoenix, Morphling, Invoker, Meepo, Pudge and more. I Will state from my own experience that you are better off practicing a few days if you wanna land good hooks or sun strikes rather than doing these scripts because honestly, it is just way too complicated to have a third party key setting to think about at the same time. And besides, combos can backslide very hard and you look like an idiot when you are throwing cold snap and tornado on one enemy just to throw chaos meteor on the other one far behind.  [https://imgur.com/gallery/yhGSELo](https://imgur.com/gallery/yhGSELo)

But on smart peoples hands, ***This can be really dangerous.***

**Let me tell you first about the basic and obvious detectable cheats:**

* You can snatch runes automatically but this is detectable during replays if you are not hovering your mouse on the bounty rune.
* You can zoom out the camera as if you were spectating a game but you are playing a ranked game. You can autoblock creeps and this is a total accurate blocking, but still detectable during replays.
* You can afk while jungling with bot and auto buy tomes.
* You can auto stack and auto disable heroes who are trying to blink or attack you.
* You also have the possibility to use exactly **ALL** cosmetic items and weather while playing but this is only showing for yourself.

**Here comes the scary part of that script, The awareness:**

* You can detect wards and sentries placed by the enemy, there is also an indicator showing above your own hero when there is true sight on you. So if you are playing Riki or Bounty or Invoker with ghost walk, you can easily see when they are seeing you and you can avoid gang bang.
* You have an indicator for techies mines and an indicator for enemy mana bars and cooldown of heroes ultis and spells. [https://imgur.com/gallery/ofI9CMy](https://imgur.com/gallery/ofI9CMy)

&#x200B;

* Incoming projectiles such as Pudge hooks, Lina stun, Ancient apparitions ulti, Kunkkas ghostship and torrent, Invokers sun strike, Miranas arrow can all be totally shown to you too and it's honestly VERY scary how accurately you can avoid all spells from being hit and still make it look like it's based on game sense.
* Enemy illusions appear as your own illusions in blue shape, this is just a total F\*\*k you to Phantom Lancer and Naga. [https://imgur.com/gallery/tqPw8gY](https://imgur.com/gallery/tqPw8gY)

&#x200B;

* You also get notifications when and where enemy team smokes or attacks roshan and as if it can't get any worse, you get to see where the enemy is farming in the jungle. [https://imgur.com/gallery/UOQlyK7](https://imgur.com/gallery/UOQlyK7)

Obviously, all these features together with a team, can be VERY VERY dangerous. You will have full control of map and this is honestly just super ridiculous because that script is still being updated. I sincerely hope that this post will mean anything for you as a player because I feel so betrayed, knowing that this shit exists for this long time and as a becoming father in November, I know that my dota days will be easily over soon but I surely hope that Valve will at least make an effort to shut this down. Or at least update dota to not be cooperative with third party applications or SOMETHING.

Thanks for your precious time./P

**Edit**: The response is huge guys and I deeply appreciate your discussions, insights and also all of your sceptical thoughts!

First of all, this is not me trying to advertise cheat in any form. Even though I know the outcome may glorify peoples thoughts and curiosity for cheating. But you know what? Who wouldn't be if it's so damn easy to get your hands on these nasty scripts. I am not blaming anyone who tries.

The real nasty business here is the cheat developers actually making a BIG profit out of this. Heck, let's do some more napkin math here:

Let us assume that 70 000 registered members actually spent 2 dollars once for a week of access to dota 2 cheats. That is still an INSANE amount of 140 000 $! That money could have all gone to TI prize pool.. !

Second. Me stating that 10 out of 10 games having a cheater, should be taken very lightly since it's just a plain assumption without any source. Altough I still believe that cheats are as common as always having a teleport scroll in your inventory.

**I REPEAT**: These cheats will NOT make you a better player! As many people have stated here. Skill overcomes cheaters but it is a true fact that being aware of your enemy team is a big game breaker and therefore, it is a very dangerous feature! Many people here have talked about their friends having these scripts. But imagine a team of full house using scripts together and using communication skills to actually break the game completely to your benefits. That is the real deal I am trying to achieve here.",2020-06-30T23:09:17,LABEL_0,0.5844717025756836

post,dota2,2022,xltjmf,"my death letter (probably) Hello. This is Kamyab. An Iranian Dota player, filmmaker and photographer.
As you guys may know, Iran is having a revolution right now. Police killed a 22 year old girl because of fucking hijab. People are in the streets for 6 days now. They are taking police stations, banks, mayors' offices and everything. Government cuts off out internet most of the dayand all of the night. I sat in my room for 6 days now, watching all the videos of people fighting the regime. I can't anymore! I am crying as im writing this. So now, 1:35 pm, im going to play 1 more dota game. My love, my escape, my joy, my life. Then im gonna go join my brothers and sisters on the streets. To help them, to help my country get back what she deserves. To take back the Iran we had 40 years ago. 
Im asking you to share the hashtag #opiran and #mahsaamini in your social accounts; maybe the world helps us win this civil war. 
If you guys didnt see me, didnt hear from me or even if you DON'T FUCKING CARE for me and my country, just know that this community gave me life. I LOVE ALL OF YOU. From pro players to noobs like myself. From cyka blyat saying mad russians to weird SEA players. From casters to analysers. I LOVE U ALL! I loved every single second I spent in this game. I loved every piece of this community.
WISH US LUCK! 
Much Love, Kamyab Tizrø.
___________________
EDIT: Update: just got home. It's 1:52 am now. Man, I did not expect all this respect and love. I did not know that our dota community is so caring. 1 week ago, as an Iranian, I thought that we are alone in this world. I thought everybody hates us. But through this week and specially in the past couple of minutes that I got to read some of your responses, I understood that no matter what culture people have or what country people live in, we're all human and we care for each other and we are against non human things. Did I say I love you enough times to thank you for your kindness? This community definitely knows the way to cheer up a broken soul. Some of you wrote some dota related jokes, some of you sent straight forward love, some of you told their stories. Man, I'm gonna fall sleep reading these comments.
As an update to the situation. Police forces are doubled, at least where I went to. They are beating people alot. At first they just attacked young people but now they are beating up the adults and older people. All the girls have removed their scarves and just burning them. I was on my way to the car to come back to home when a group of 10 took me to a corner and interrogate me. they hit me once in the leg which was not painful at all but they hit me once in the head too which was a little painful at the moment, but I just held my head like I was in alot of pain so they leave me. They searched my phone for pictures and messages but I dont keep any on my phone. They also searched my camera bag and went through some of my photos on my camera which they couldnt find anything useful to them. They were somewhat concerned about hitting me in the head and they just let me go. Tonight was a success, because we are just making the regime tired. They cant hold on forever. the police needs rest. But us, people, are more than them and we can finally outrun them. I will go out again every night and I will update this post here. One more time, I FKN LOVE YOU PEOPLE. 1 for all and all for 1 🧡✊
________________________
EDIT2: update:
so, it's been about a week since my last update. we go to the streets every second day. ( i dont know if this phrase is right, i mean that i go today, i take a day off and i go the day after that). this way we have more chance that the police can't recognize us. the police is tired. alot! they are using religious children with police uniforms (without ranks) to fill out the streets. some cities are under people's full control. the regime is using tanks and heavy guns to take back those cities. people are tired too. they can't work, they can't communicate. we have no mobile data. we only have internet for home telephones and that is so weak. a majority of people around iran are having a strike. they are not going to work, so this way the economy forces the regime to answer our needs. oh, aside from all of this, did I tell you they FUCKING BANNED DOTA2 today. so i guess,""my death letter"" title was not that much of a joke. i dont know if this censorship is permanent or not, i guess not, but I hope I can play this game again, someday.
______________
Edit3: update:
So, I'm alive, but they killed alot. They are killing at least 20 people everyday. They are weak. Some news says that the officials of Iran are sending their families to other countries with private planes. People are going to the streets more and more everyday. They sent a man with AK47 to a mosque in Shiraz and he killed 15 people. Innocent people. It's the kind of mosque that security will search down to your asshole! And he brought a fkn AK47! Regime says it was ISIS but they designed a poster about the Terrorist Attack and posted it an hour before the attack! :)) anyway, the people around the world are protesting for us and they are giving us such energy and hope that we are destroying the regime everyday. I will update this more frequently from now on. Thanks for being our voice ✊🇮🇷🧡

Edit4: update
November 10th 2022
So we have 2 important days coming. 1 is today. The other one is Nov19th. 
7 days ago they killed a boy from my city. Erfan. We all knew him. Thousands of people from the neighbour cities came to our city for the funeral. Police didnt let us mourn our friend. They brought special forces and shot at the people. People resisted a lot. But they couldnt handle the gunshots and smoke grenades. Today is the 7th day and more people are about to come here and to their own cities. The regime shared a statement to all cities via news and megaphones through the streets that all the shops and malls and etc should be closed. It's literally war! Today is going to be a blood bath in all over Iran. but! Nov19th is different. All the countries around the world are rising for Iran. All the iranians and non iranians who love iranian people are going to the streets at the same time to be the voice of iran. Also the iranians are going to go to the streets with full power.

post,dota2,2020,gvkmal,"Thank you Valve for giving us 1.95% more levels. We really don't deserve 1.95% levels, especially for the TI10 and the world on crisis. A decade of supporting and following the game, 1.95% free levels feels so wrong. It feels like we're stealing 1.95% wealth of Lord Gaben, Valve and it's executives; especially the executives.

I know it's hard to say but, the dota 2 community doesn't deserve 1.95% levels. With the TI10 BattlePass full of evenly distributed generous rewards like Disco Balls, Hot Peppers, ~~(Ralai) (Rilai) (Rylia)~~ Rylai spin and recycling through Sideshop, which are definitely not a scam and gambling.

How can the community have the audacity to complain and not be grateful of 1.95% more levels? How can they say TI10 BattlePass is a spendfest, pay to pay, and gambling when we got more 1.95% more levels?

To be honest, the community deserve less immortal treasures, a shorter version of temporary ^(ceb) voice line for reaching or buying out for the prestigious level 100 reward, and more limited edition Arcana to not definitely create fear of missing out.

If Valve continue to give out 1.95% more levels, they might ran out of budget for the new player experience. Also, they definitely did not nerfed the wagering and guild contract points before launch, fortunately, Valve is very generous and ""increased"" the points you can earn from them.

Once again, I can't thank enough Valve for 1.95% more levels from Valve. We, from the community are very thankful for 1.95% more levels.

post,dota2,2022,y9eyti,"Valve owes the community an explanation around this year's TI The most glaring of issues that we know about, to date, deserves answers to these questions:

* Does Valve feel like the integrity of the matches are compromised by the fact that there are no sound proof booths, giving advantage to the English speaking players? 

* Is there a chance that a non-English primary language team may have been eliminated due to playing an English primary language team that may have been able to use the caster and crowd noises to their advantage?

* Did Valve decide to be hands off with this year's TI, leaving the quality and integrity of Dota's premier tournament in the sole hands of PGL?

* Did Valve issue an RFP out to tournament organizers and if PGL's proposal won, did they meet expectations for a Dota TI caliber tournament?

* If they did not meet the expectations, how will PGL be held accountable? 

* If there were thousands of people queued up to buy tickets for TI, why did PGL book an event space that only had 500 seats for the playoffs?

* Should the community lower its expectations about future TIs or will Valve ensure that the quality of the production and the integrity of the games meet a certain minimum standard going forward?",2022-10-21T08:37:36,LABEL_0,0.539013147354126
