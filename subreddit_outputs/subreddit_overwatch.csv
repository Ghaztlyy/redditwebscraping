post,overwatch,2020,ekd1pt,"Hey Blizzard, any chance of whipping up a couple of firefighter skins for Junkrat and Roadhog to raise money for the Aussie wildfires? You did it with Mercy for breast cancer research, and it was a great success. Even Junkrat would get on board with this: he wants to blow things up, not burn the world down.

EDIT: Someone cross-posted this to the Overwatch official forums and asked me to [link it here](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/overwatch/t/junkhog-charity-skins-in-support-of-australias-fire-roverwatch/443649)",2020-01-05T21:32:32,LABEL_2,0.502781093120575

post,overwatch,2021,mwf8e4,"thank you r/overwatch and r/cow the communities on r/overwatch and r/Competitiveoverwatch have meant so much to me. i just wanted to sign off one last time and thank you for all of your inspiration, shared stories and highlights, feedback, criticism and comradery. 

&#x200B;

whenever i think about the reddit communities, i always think of r/Overwatch as ""timmy"" (aka punch kid): bright-eyed, optimistic and r/Competitiveoverwatch as ""brian"" the slightly jaded older brother who realizes in the end that he actually loves overwatch but just kind of forgets it along the way sometimes...

&#x200B;

either way, you're amazing and you made my career better. you made me a better designer and game director.

&#x200B;

please take care of the overwatch team. they are wonderful, caring, brilliant people and they need you right now.

post,overwatch,2022,ye16uv,"This subreddit is in damage control mode This subreddit is deliberately removing posts that give genuine criticism to the monetization system of Overwatch 2.

It is also removing posts that point to the illegality of the monetization system in current countries such as Australia and most of the EU. 

I urge everyone to continue with the outcry and, if you live in a country where the monetization system is illegal, to contact your local representative.
