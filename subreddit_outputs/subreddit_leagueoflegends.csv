post,leagueoflegends,2020,h9hxzf,"I'm almost 43, I just hit Gold, and I have no one to tell it to. TL;DR: I'm old but Gold.

I've been playing League for over nine years now, and the dream always was to be above average. It's not a big dream, but there you go.

When we still had ELO, that meant being above 1200 (I never was). As soon as we had the ranked system, I wanted to be Gold. That's where the shiny borders are. That's where you get skins. That's where you can tell people you're actually kinda decent at this game.

The problem always was that I suck. My already non-existent mechanical skills managed to deteriorate even further after I hit 40. I also can't play every day, since my family and my job come first. And there's always too much happening on the screen for me to follow. I regularly confuse my own character with one of my teammates. I'm incapable of outplaying anyone.

So what I do is play braindead champions in the toplane, disable chat, ward as much as possible, bash towers whenever I can, and let the young folk carry me.

This afternoon it finally happened. I goofed around on Garen a bit while my Draven killed everyone and everything, and at the end of that game I was Gold. I'm absolutely ecstatic, but no one I know plays League. In fact, everyone I know thinks I'm a bit of a twat to still play videogames at my age. But to me this is a big thing.

So there you go. And I'm pretty sure if I can do this, any one of you can too!",2020-06-15T22:57:02,LABEL_0,0.5353337526321411

post,leagueoflegends,2020,g18sl2,"Riot is forcing me to change my name due to Coronavirus. Hey all, 

So I will try to keep this anonymous as possible, though it's quite hard given my current situation. I've been playing League of Legends for 6 years under the alias Squid Corona - squids are my favourite animal and Corona, believe it or not, is my real life surname. 

As I'm sure everyone is well aware, there is a global pandemic called COVID-19 or, as very inconveniently for me, better known as Coronavirus. Trust me, I've heard all the jokes possible from friends and co-workers. 

At the start of 2019 I managed to change my in-game name to just ""Corona"" as I thought the shorter version of my name was nicer, worked well with telling my real life friends to add me on League, as they all know it's my surname and I think Corona is a cool name so why not have just that. I had to use one of those third party sites to check the name and stay up till midnight in order to secure my family name in League (as a side note, Riot should really consider implementing a bot-detect system to stop name sniping).

I'm by most descriptions a casual player - I play one or two games a day of normal draft pick, almost always with friends just as a way of relaxing after work. On the 1st of April, I try to login to be greeted with a message telling me I need to change my name in order to proceed. I thought it was amusing at first, as almost every game a player would say in chat ""nice name"" to me, but I just shrugged my shoulders and emailed Riot in the hopes of them agreeing that it was a funny situation, and my name would be white-listed. 

After two weeks of back and forth with multiple ""Player Support Specialists"", I was told that they had come to the conclusion that my name would not get white-listed and that I would have to change it if I wanted to keep playing League of Legends. **This is specially stupid since in other regions, players with the name Corona are still active and playing.**

This to me is all very disappointing. I haven't chosen the name ""Corona"" for any reason, and certainly haven't done it during the covid-19 outbreak. I feel like Riot are just sticking a big middle finger to me and telling me that my family name is inappropriate to be a part of their game. I'm posting this to reddit because I want to know if the community really feels offended by the summoner name ""Corona"", or if I'm right in feeling a mild rage and sense of unfairness.

EDIT: here's proof of communication: https://imgur.com/a/OE9l8sc
Proof of ID has also been privately sent.

EDIT 2: Thanks for the pressure reddit, Riot has given me my account back!",2020-04-15T00:32:38,LABEL_1,0.4587266743183136

So i Opened op.gg and searched the name of the account he was playing on in the video ""ProfessorIRONxd"" and geuss what there where no account with this name

So i searched the name of his jungler playing zac ""Wreck It Ralph\*\*""\*\* And found the game that had the fed akali in it , which is his only zac game go check it if u want [https://na.op.gg/summoner/userName=Wreck+It+Ralph](https://na.op.gg/summoner/userName=Wreck+It+Ralph)

And i found out that he changed the account name to ""reeeeeeent"" Right after he finished making this video his op.gg [https://na.op.gg/summoner/userName=reeeeeeent](https://na.op.gg/summoner/userName=reeeeeeent)

and if u check this op.gg  ur gonna find that the last 3 games played where akali games that he won (last one played is the one in the video) but before that all of the other games is him going 0/8 ,0/13  etc for 16 games in a row

> I'm gay. I've struggled with my personal identity my entire life. While my parents were working in China, I moved around a lot from homestay to homestay, which is basically where you live in a stranger's home. At the age of 8, I was bombarded with homophobic and sexist remarks at home, and whenever I did something that wasn't ""manly,"" I was told, ""Why are you acting like a girl?"" and to stop being ""gay."" I was hyper-conscious of how I should act and tried not to act or sound ""gay,"" but I was still constantly bullied at school for it. No child should have to feel like they don't belong. Working in the video game industry hasn't helped matters either. On almost every team I've been on, I've heard homophobic comments from either my teammates or the staff and felt uncomfortable, even borderline afraid of possibly losing my job if I told the truth. I'm at a point in my life where I've accepted who I am, and it's taken me a long time to get there. My story is not unique. The gaming industry is rampant with sexism, prejudice, and homophobia. I don't believe there's a quick fix, but it starts with us holding ourselves to a higher standard and treating everyone with dignity. We need to educate people in esports of proper conduct within the workplace. I'm not making this announcement because I owe everyone the details of my personal life, but because I want there to be more awareness about the problems our community faces. Thank you to my parents and friends who have made me feel like I belong. You the real ones.",2022-05-08T02:11:16,LABEL_0,0.695418119430542
post,leagueoflegends,2021,mw8kfy,"Goodbye, League: A brief love letter from a visually impaired player I was not expecting today to be any different in terms of big life changes, it's really just a Thursday, pandemic seems to be easing up a little... But this morning, as I was playing draft pick, I understood something very painful: It was the last time I would play League of Legends.

I have been experiencing a very sudden process of sight loss due to untreated glaucoma since April 2020 that culminated in me hitting the threshold for legal blindness last December. All throughout the process, I kept playing League, as it was legitimately my favorite game and I had so much fun playing, but the past three months or so have been incredibly taxing, emotionally. I was playing more sporadically because even 15 minutes of straining my eyes leaves me with a migraine, but the more time that went between matches, the more noticeable my sight loss became whenever I logged in and sat for 30 minutes watching my gameplay worsen, the information slowly becoming something I could not parse. It was obviously not just the migraines, but the solidification of the fact that, well, fuck, I am going blind.

I know the community has a reputation for being jaded and toxic, and to an extent, I did get splashes of that experience, but honestly? My experience as a player was overwhelmingly positive. League was something for me to bond over with my real life friends, and a gateway to kind communities where I got to know online friends that would come to matter more to me than words could express. It was rewarding, I could see myself improve with practice, even if I never aimed for a high rank, and sitting down every night to play a few hours was the only thing that kept me going in what have been, quite frankly, a shit couple of years. When I think of League it's never the bad matches that stick with me, it's the neat outplays, the honest conversations about life in voice chat, the delight that came with messing around with builds and meeting people that I had this in common with. 

Today was the day the loss finally hit. I was playing a Lux match, and understanding that even with my main, even with the more contrasting skin I could find, and all the color settings adjusted, and a giant monitor with a magnifier could not do anything about the fact that I just could not play because I could not see anything relevant. No abilities, no health bars, no indicators... My lack of peripheral vision also meant that all my attempts at hitting anything were mostly guesswork. Hell, the only reason I knew who I even was playing was the color of the blurry HP bar that took up a quarter of my monitor. 

I don't think I can kid myself anymore into thinking that things will remain the same even as this huge part of my life changes into something unknown and terrifying. I hate that League of all things was what made me understand how real and irreversible the sight loss is, but it is what it is. So today, I have decided that I have played my last game of League. I did not savor it. I did not prep a goodbye party, and if this is a goodbye speech then it's kind of shitty.

I would still like to make use of this cheesy word vomit to thank League players and the team behind the game. You've brought many things to my life that I hope will remain now that League is no longer in it, and I am grateful. Regardless of what comes next, I will remember these times in my life fondly, and that's pretty much invaluable.

Thank you, it's been great. See you on the flip side.",2021-04-23T00:25:30,LABEL_1,0.4019353985786438

post,leagueoflegends,2020,hyr8dn,"Red Side Cannon Minions have 20 lower attack range than Blue Side ones (for 11 years, since Alpha) I was writing a new wiki page about [unit size](https://leagueoflegends.fandom.com/wiki/Size) the other day. One of the size modifiers that exists is Baron Buff, which only affects minions, but sure enough, this page was about non-champion sizes, too.

So after I set out to determine those modifiers, I also wanted to confirm the attack range increases on the Baron Buff page, which I asked a friend to get me. For the Cannon Minions, he returned '1050/1030 total range'.

I looked at those 2 values the same way you are right now. Nope, this isn't about other minions on any separate map; these are SR cannon minions. The Blue Cannon has 300 attack range; The Red Cannon only has 280 range!

As it turned out, this has been a bug since the earliest builds of the game we have access to; all the way back from Alpha! Minions are coded as separate units for both sides of the map; So are skins, technically, albeit they properly draw from the same data file for the gameplay side (the only differences are tags like 'human' and 'freljord' which VO interactions use). Same types of minions...do not draw from the same file. Not a big problem, though, as they only have to get a few values right? Yes, in theory, that isn't a big problem.

Unfortunately, in the game right now, [**this** is an excerpt the Blue Cannon Minion data file](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/334447591372619778/736725095849918484/unknown.png), and [this is the same excerpt in the data for the Red Cannon minion](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/334447591372619778/736722781516857444/unknown.png). apart from the Name ID's, notice a difference?

And indeed, in the game, these minions adhere to those range values. 

[If you make 2 opposing cannons run into each other without interference, they'll not always start attacking each other at the same time like same-ranged units would](see \*Edit below for why this link is missing) - instead the Blue Minion goes first a lot of times. The reason it doesn't happen always is that 'is my enemy in attack range yet' is checked only so often, which is also why attacking an enemy moves your champion slightly closer than their attack range would require most of the time. Some would argue that that is to aid in chasing/orb-walking, but I don't think it was set up with that in mind. In any case, attack pathfinding at least doesn't path you into Dragon pit if you want to attack someone on the other side of that wall that is in range of Dragon pit at the time, which would be dumb.

###Edit: I got some help in re-doing the proof for this:

Using Syndra W, we can get exact range values and eliminate the *'is my enemy in attack range yet' check* by throwing the minion straight from inside its range to slightly further than it was before. If it attacks without walking, it's inside its attack range; If it nudges forward first, it was thrown further than it's attack range.

[Test with Blue Cannon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KGli9vl6LA) | [Test with Red Cannon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Spxwe27i6P4)

Here is a [comparison for the longest throw at which the minion doesn't nudge forward (= is still in attack range) at.](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/549266844964618242/737305947759837324/unknown.png) The difference isn't large (it's about 5% of attack range against a normal-sized champion), but you can see it [via the cursor location.](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/549266844964618242/737307018922295387/unknown.png)

-

Also, [there's a Ryze bug that made separating these minions kinda annoying yet kind of fun.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmgKH_Aadps) This is the reason you canot port a single Rift Herald, or a single minion period, btw (first minion takes last ported champion's position, or won't get a new location at all if no champion was ported).

-

I tried showing off this difference in the one patch where the new HUD showed unit ranges in the collapsed version (5.14), [however minions all show as 0-ranged anyway due to ((bug))](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/549266844964618242/737283877122343043/unknown.png). Which is sad, maybe someone would have noticed it then already!

-

The fact that blue team seems to generally win when the game is left alone by players entirely might be due to this bug. Blue team also has a higher winrate overall in the game, which is often attributed to the assymetry in HUD and the map, which is reasonable, but I wonder what the impact of this bug has been on that winrate, afterall.

-

\*Edit: Turns out the mentioned tickrates make this way too hard, and upon reviewing the best clip I have, it has minion damage increase due to my target dummies leveling up, so ~~I'll remake this for you with a proof that's less up-to chance.~~

Edit2: Remade proof. Now definitive. See above.

post,leagueoflegends,2020,k1rhma,"A 53 year old Mum giving thanks to League of Legends for helping her to reconnect with her son Five years ago, I felt disconnected from my 17 year old son. All he talked about was League and I had never played a computer game in my life. I did not understand why he couldn't just stop mid-game when I needed him to. I did not understand his love of esports. We were drifting apart.

So, I asked him to teach me how to play.

To say that it was a steep learning curve is an understatement. But I kept at it because I loved him. The more I understood about the game, the closer we got. After some disastrous games on Summoner's Rift (where I was rightly flamed for not knowing how to ping), I switched to just playing ARAM because it forced me to learn what all champions do. It was also more chill.

While I was never very good and never tried playing ranked, I understood enough to enjoy watching the LCK, MSI and Worlds. In 2019, my son and I travelled to Taiwan together to watch both of the semifinals of MSI. It is a memory that I will always cherish.

post,leagueoflegends,2020,gm2hd4,"The Only Way to Solve Toxicity is with More Sexually Aggressive Skins/Champions The only way to solve toxicity in SoloQ is with more sexually aggressive skins. 
&nbsp;

Think about it. What causes toxicity in Soloq? Toxicity exists because players play the game. However, by having more sexually aggressive skins/champions. By limiting the hands require to play the game to one the toxicity would be reduced literally to 50%. That one toxic player in your team? His toxicity now are reduced to 50%. He call your mom fat? He now calls you mom. 
&nbsp;

#But We already have some and that didn't help
Pool party Taric, Armor of the fifth age Taric, Ahri, Pajama Urgot, Rek Sai, etc. They are all great skins/champions but there is a greater demand than the supply. Everyone has their ""playstyle"" and not all their ""playstyle"" is being fulfilled. So more skins/champions would make players happier. 
&nbsp;

Let's compare real numbers. Not counting PBE let's say toxicity level in Fiddlestick Rework Patch is 10. Right now the toxicity level is 0 on Voibear Rework patch(10.11) as of today. You can even say no one is playing on that patch except Riot Client Programers. This is why I think Fiddlestick should have been reworked to a Waifu that hugs you when he ults and not this little scared farmer's son hiding in the jungle. 

#Real Science behind it
 Freud the father of Psychology says that libido, our sexual desire, drives our every action. Libido has a broader meaning than just sexual desire but it doesn't fit my narrative so I am going to ignore it. Right now League player's libido are not being fulfilled so they try to release it in ways that could be harmful to people around them and themselves. 
 &nbsp;

#Top Lane
Top lane has been recognized as one of the worst roles to play but there is a reason people still play them. If you ask any top laners why they **really** play top lane they would say ""I just want to see two big dudes smashing each other."" This is why people play top. People pick Jax so they can see and feel Jax use his big and necessary large rod against Malphite who is literally just a big bulge. However, this is not enough for some players. When they play jax they imagine themself as Jax smashing Malphite but when they realize they are the one being smashed their mental collapse. Their libido went unfulfilled so they tried to smash anything that is close by which is in many cases their junglers. They smashed Jungler via their chat and well that is how toxicity start. 
&nbsp;

But if Jax or even Malphite has a attractive skin Jax wouldn't need to chat or int to fulfill his libido. He could simply zoom in on his character which he is already doing it anyway. He could just play his best and accept he can't be on top every game and sometimes he have to be bottom. This combine with 50% of hand usage elimination would eliminate toxicity on Top lane. 
#ADC
ADC players are masochists. They like being slaved around by their random braindead partner. They like comparing their suffering to other ADC and enjoy the rush of freedom when eventually their shackle are set free. That high when 0/10 Jinx reached 4 items and is no longer a ranged minion is something no any role can reach. But now that even when you reach 4 items that high is no longer guaranteed. 30 minutes of buildup just to be instantly killed off by a 0/2/99 mid laner. Where does that energy go? That energy that has been built up for the last 30 minutes? Into the chat it goes. 
&nbsp;

People start picking Mages bot not because they are stronger or something(lol) but because they have better skins. Ahri, Vlad, Ziggs, Syndra all have very attractive skins and only MF could really compete against them. Which is probably why MF has one of the highest pick rate and win rate. 
#Mid/Jungle/Support
NO one cares about those roles. They don't do anything in game anyway so there is no need to talk about them. Right now games are decided by Top and ADC. Mid/Jungle/Support has no agency whatsoever compare to Top/ADC so there is no point talking about them. 
#It's time for more Kaisa Skin
Voibear Rework is a step in the right direction. This would fulfill people with questionable desires and hopefully stop them from going outside. Many people libido are being unfulfilled and by giving them champions and skin that matched their disgusting desire they would be happier. Don't ask which demographic they made Yuumi for. For F2P player the Honor System could reward them with skins which would prompt them to think libido in long term and reward holding it in. Streamers should also be encouraged to equipped those skins so the viewers could learn that that is a way to release their libido. I don't think it is right to witch hunt streamers that don't equip those skins since everyone has their own ""preference"" and you never know what the context is. Unless obviously if they play Taric without Pool Party or Gem of the fifth age skin but even then just report them and don't personally attack them.
&nbsp;

#What I am trying to say is: It is time to pull out Pool Part Urgot.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

#Potential Question:
&nbsp;

1. Why does NA have this problem and not Korea?
&nbsp;

A: Cause NA doesn't have Kpop and not having Kpop stars ruling your country is a big disadvantage culturally. Everyone there is playing League to please their Kpop King/Queen so victory is the way they fulfill their libido. 

&nbsp;

2. How about the little blue mens ruining my games??

&nbsp;

A: Those blue men are typically called smurfs and they are actually pro player/coaches trying to scout that Gold 4 Brand that solo killed Faker years ago. Unfortunately, the scout is unsuccessful but still ongoing and now it is almost a part of the game. Just try your best and maybe you can fool them that you are the brand player and get in LCS. Just remember that they are scouting because they are not at Faker's level so just laugh at them desperately trying to scout Faker killer in Iron 2 and being hardstuck at LCS. 

&nbsp;

3. What should I do when other player tries to fulfill their libido on me?

&nbsp;

A: If you are into it you can enter their role play but just don't become the problem trying to solve the problem. Let's say your step-sister is stuck in the bathroom and needs your help. Don't go in and get stuck yourselves. Call the fire department because accidents in the bathroom are dangerous and can break some bones if you are not careful. Sometime the fire department comes too late or never comes. In that case, you should simply lock the door and cover your ear to prevent your sister's dying cry from traumatizing you. Know that even Saints like Voyboy are unsuccessful in helping others get unstuck. Don't get yourself stuck trying to help others because now your stepmom has to come help and it just keeps ongoing.

post,leagueoflegends,2021,qws4vk,"[Announcement] I will be staying as a silver player for 2022 Hi all, just to clear up some speculations.

I'd like to announce I will be staying in Silver for the 2022 Season. I'm sure most people have read the leaks from Bloop & ESPORTMANÍACOS in regards to me reaching gold next season. I did receive a lot of enticing offers, with the final conversation being centered around me potentially joining DIG upon reaching Gold (unfortunately I already have a mousepad though).

We could not come to a firm decision on whether I would be reaching Gold next season, as such I have made the choice to stay in Silver. This is my personal choice and one that I hope my fans will still support me through out my career.

Thank you.",2021-11-18T23:26:34,LABEL_2,0.579295814037323

post,leagueoflegends,2021,m49dx5,"Ziggs is practically obsolete, with only a 0.8% pick-rate. To make him meta again, I propose replacing his character model with an anime girl. Introducing Kled and Zigg's adoptive daughter: KLEEGS, the Hexplosive Expert Updated bio: Kleegs is the adopted daughter of Kled and Ziggs. She takes after Ziggs a lot more though, since Kled left to ""go buy some milk"" 2 days after her adoption. She wears a smaller version of Zigg's goggles and throws the same bombs as him to attack. Her hat is a legendary magic-resistant item known as the Adoptive Helm.

Essentially, this is a VGU that changes Zigg's character model to Kleeg's. The same is done for all his/her skins. Her abilities and stats are exactly the same as Ziggs, but since she's an anime girl, she will sell many skins and will be forced to be meta.

Although Ziggs will no longer be in the game, he'll live on as a character in the lore, until he dies a tragic death to further Kleeg's character development. Thank you.

Our job as bush people is to beat up innocent animals and occasionally make fights unfair for the other team. We are not your personal on-demand “win this lane on my behalf” valet service to carry your lp to your elo of choice. We cannot guarantee your lane wins with a single gank, nor can we suddenly turn the tide in your favor when you’ve handed the Katarina 1,000 free gold and have yet to even consider a null magic mantle. We are not designed to be able to perfectly smitesteal a 4 man bot lane on drake on command, and we are not capable of warding more than twice every few minutes. If you die solo in lane multiple times, you not only have made it frustratingly difficult to try and gank your lane, but the problem you just created is now going to show up in our bushes poking our flying lizards. And we will have to somehow make due with what we have.

You are responsible for your own lane. Your death is not the fault of the dog on the other side of the map eating several live chickens.

post,leagueoflegends,2021,m9xbzg,"Forcing new players to wait 9 levels for smite and flash still doesn't make any sense. If Riot acknowledges jungle as a proper role and a part of how the game is meant to be played then the summoner spell Smite shouldn't be restricted.

And also since flash is ""mandatory"" on basically every champ, why is that not the spell they are given with heal at lvl 1, so that they can learn how the game is suppose to be played? Instead they play heal and ghost and then once they learn the game they go ""Oh, hey, I actually have to take this summoner that I have never used before on every champion.

You could also argue that this is a smurf-only issue but I've seen tens of thousands of players complaining that they would like to begin the game as jungler, and maybe if they could be a jungler earlier on, there would be better junglers in the lower level and elos. Saying this is a smurf-only problem is blind hate coming from someone who had bad experiences with smurfs, I mean, have you ever asked the new players if they would like to jungle?

Dodging is not a problem, the problem is THE REASON why people are dodging. People are not dodging for fun or just to ruin other players experience, people dodge games because they feel threatened by other players, people dodge games because they are being held hostage by other players, people dodge games because they got matched with streamers who FORCE them to give up role for their sake.

Do not amp up LP penalties for dodges but instead look into the issue why people are dodging in a first place. Do not turn the blind eye to the fact that the problem lies elsewhere and suggested solution will turn out to be even more frustrating for the players.

Instead of punishing players for dodging games make them feel secure enough so they don't have to dodge. People are not doing this for fun. They just don't want to waste 20-50 minutes of their time because of some soloq teorrirst clown.",2020-04-04T19:33:37,LABEL_0,0.8095365762710571

post,leagueoflegends,2020,grabyg,"Shout out to the game designers for Warwick This is not a sarcastic post. My girlfriend started playing league, and she loved the idea of playing jungler when I explained it to her. Warwick has been perfectly designed for a new player and a new jungler.

The q and his passive keep him on great health while jungling at all stages in the game. He can solo dragon and Rift herald easily (she LOVES getting all 4 dragons). His blood trail let’s her know when someone on the map is low, so she knows that she may have an opportunity to gank.

I’m a diamond jungle main, and I’ve pretty much never played Warwick, but watching and teaching her how to play it really gave me a huge appreciation for that champions design. I’d have to say it’s one of the most successful reworks ever done in the game.


**

edit: Here are the answers some of the most common questions I've had on the thread...

**How do you have a girlfriend and get to diamond**:  Got to diamond first, the girlfriend comes shorty after.

**How did you get your girlfriend to play League**: She always heard me playing and having a great time, so eventually she wanted to learn.  We actually played that old Miniclip game Motherload together a lot when we started dating so she 'gets' gaming.

**Can I watch your girlfriend**: If you mean watch her play league.... yes! I am not allowed to post my twitch account on reddit however

post,leagueoflegends,2020,k65t24,"KDA has become progressively more cringey as it has gone on, and now we are reaching peak levels. The music videos and stuff were cool, same with the skins and the music itself. But now we’re getting these weird “interviews” with the characters, and it’s just getting more and more cringey to me.

[Take this Akali one for example. ](https://youtu.be/j1RjqonnU7M) Using a different voice actress than both the singer or her in game character, she sounds like a 13 year old trying to sound cool. The animation on all of these is getting worse and worse, she looks like an animated Ps2 character. I legitimately think they are using some form of the face-tracking webcam software that just places a 3D character over someone else, that’s how bad it looks.

And don’t get me started with the [poorly photoshopped people using hand drawn KDA heads](https://images.contentstack.io/v3/assets/blt731acb42bb3d1659/blta8d515531d8ce728/5f600414d70e764f3292008b/MBAR_014_Akali003_16x9.jpg?quality=90). And yes, this is from the official KDA website, not fan made. I can’t see how that was approved by anyone to post, it looks so bad. I really thought all of the videos and posts I have been seeing were fan made, but nope, Riot is responsible for them.

I liked KDA and what it started out as, and I still do to an extent, but this just seems super desperate to appeal to a younger audience and it’s comical to me.

Edit: Saying “this isn’t made for you, it’s for KDA fans” doesn’t even apply, because I said I liked KDA right out the gate. It’s the poorly made videos and promos that are bothersome, not because of what it is, but because it looks so rushed and thrown together last second for a cash grab that it’s almost insulting to people who legitimately enjoyed it. As a KDA fan I AM THE INTENDED AUDIENCE and what is being made SUCKS.",2020-12-04T04:44:56,LABEL_0,0.8858216404914856

Naturally I'd imagine that this would upset my teammates, however my teammates seem to get upset no matter what happens which is exactly why they are the type of people from which I need some space.

If anyone thinks this would be unbalanced I think that reducing the champion's base magic resist by 2 would put him in a more balanced state",2021-05-16T07:23:27,LABEL_0,0.47200462222099304
post,leagueoflegends,2021,l3645c,"Releasing six champions per year seems quite excessive when we already have more than 150. We should have more minor updates and full VGUs. It honestly surprises me that Riot is going with the route of making even more champions. I mean, I always wondered how far League would go when it comes to its roster, after all, more than 150 characters in a single game is a hell lot, and it seems like its going in the direction of becoming way too much.

I know that stopping new releases is extremely unlikely and hell, I'm not really saying Riot should straight up stop releasing new champions for a while, but reworks have always been an excellent to introduce content that was, realistically, new, while also updating stuff that is outdated, and considering we're having a poll to pick one of five champions, why not simply rework like three of them and get rid of three new champion releases?

Having less new champions would also have the effect of making the ones getting released more memorable. Now, the pandemic probably contributed to the issue, but it felt like some champions were thrown in the game without ceremony: Lillia, Samira and Rell were particularly overshadowed by the champions released close to them, Lillia could not compete with the hype around Yasuo's brother, most people were talking about Seraphine when Samira was released, and Rell stood in the shadow of the Ruined King. Keep in mind I'm not saying those champions are bad or that I hate them, but they weren't given much time in the spotlight because of other champions that received much more attention even before they were officially announced.

Also, its not like Riot needs to go too far with VGUs, Ezreal is one example of a VGU that only changed one ability, but because the champion is popular, the update to his appearence and voicelines was hyped enough. We have some ugly-looking popular champions like Ahri and Lux, whose voicelines don't fit their story anymore, as well as some champions that could use only minor tweaks on their kits in addition to new appearences. Of course, we should have big VGUs (fingers crossed for Udyr to win the poll), but not all champions need gigantic changes.

An issue that is usually brought up when this topic shows up is the fact that new champions usually make more money. I cannot confirm nor deny this, because I don't have any sources, but I really wonder if all of them make that much money. Because here is the thing, I don't doubt some of them made a lot of money, Sett had a prestige skin, Yone would sell simply because he is Yasuo's brother and Seraphine was released with a lot of hype and an Ultimate skin with one of the most popular themes in the game, but did the others really make an ammount of money that, say, a reworked champion wouldn't make with their remade skins? What if champions that get reworked get one new skin too if that is the issue?

Again, I don't have the number to argue here, but I honestly don't think champions that get overshadowed are selling so much to justify the choice of inflating the ammount of champions in the roster. Besides, even if we assume that there is a loss of money, I don't think Riot would be hurt by gaining slightly less than the millions they make every year in exchange for improving the old stuff that will benefit the game in the long run. Specially because, if the number of champions start growing uncontrollably, it could reach a state that is much harder to manage.

I know this topic has been brought before, but honestly, if the community keeps bringing it up, maybe its something that could be looked into, many people aren't content with the number of new releases and how it cost us potential VGUs. An excess of releases doesn't seem like a good idea in the long run.

**EDIT:** This is a late edit (12 days), but it is relevant. Riot Reav3 has dispelled the myth that new champions make more money than VGUs and commented on why they don't do more of those. [Here is what he said:](https://old.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/lbohdz/only_one_league_vgu_will_be_released_this_year/glwvmhq/)

> I'm not sure where this perception that Champs make so much more then VGUs came from. Some VGUS have made more money then new champs,(especially ones with big skin catalogs that get updated with the VGU) some niche champs make much less then the base line VGU makes. Also, after we VGU a champ we can still make skins for it, just like a new champ. At the end of the day it doesn't matter though. The Champions Team is part of the Gameplay initiative at Riot, whos main goal is engagement not revenue. Skins in general make waaaay more then any new champion ever makes, and it's not really a goal for the Champions team to make revenue. Our main goal is engagement, which is to say we want to make products that keep people playing LoL. One of the reasons we toned down VGUs was that we saw data that showed that whenever we do a VGU some amount of players quite the game completely, usually mains of the champ that don't like the rework. If we do A LOT of VGUs in a year like we did in the past, we actually start actively going against the main goal of champs team which is engagement since we would see less engagement with the game as a result of many players quitting due to the VGUs. Actually a couple years back when we did a lot of VGUS (and the class updates) we saw in player surveys at the time a pretty big upswing in players upset that we were changing way to much, way to fast that season. This has since come down a lot since we cut class updates and reduced VGUs. Now like I have mentioned in the past, we still want to do VGUs as we believe in the longevity of LoL and part of that is making sure the game feels modern and up to date, which means updating old champs that don't feel that way, but I dont think just saying ""all players want vgu's"" is a accurate statement, at least not according to real data we have from player surveys.

Now, this certainly explains why they don't do more big VGUs, and it is a good reason, people leaving the game due to the changes to their mains is something that we know happens (even though I, personally, would never leave over that), and, like I said before, the whole ""new champions make more money"" excuse (because we know now that it is an excuse) didn't make any sense. However, this does not explain why they don't do smaller updates like Ezreal, who only needed a small kit change and got a new model and voicelines. They could still do this, because, since the kit would be mostly the same, people would not leave over that and would actually have their main looking better and having more to say.",2021-01-23T13:32:31,LABEL_1,0.47129330039024353
