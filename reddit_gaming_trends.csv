There are 3 sheets. 1 if you don't plan on selling the base PS5 (if you even have it) so you can play the 5 exclusives it has, 1 if you plan on selling the base PS5 but keep the money, and 1 if you plan on selling the base PS5 and put that money towards the PC. Each sheet has 4 separate tables. Two for optional disc drive, two without disc drive. There are then 2 more cases. One if you need a cheap keyboard and mouse set, and one if you don't need that.

Prices are from [mindfactory.de](http://mindfactory.de) and they're generally within 10% around EU countries, but YMMV.

1f43gps,gaming,Call of Duty install sizes seem to be creeping into anti-trust territory. Let me explain. ,"I have read the news about the 300 gig install size and the Activision ""walk back"" of this news to it ""might"" need 300 gigs eventually and don't think this lack of compression has anything to do with necessary file sizing - but is being used as a loophole toward monopolizing hard drive space. 

For many gamers, hard drive space and internet speed, caps, etc create a situation where the install size of COD discourages installs of its software, while also preventing installs of competitors. Sure, many might be capable of getting better internet or an expanded drive if they want - but also perhaps many COD players cannot. I can't help but feel this bloating of install size is just another attempt at forcing players into an attachment to product based on lack of resources - not enjoyment. 

There is no damn way a game with a handful of maps needs that much damn space. The ""cinematics"" being used as an excuse is just that. 

Thoughts?

Edit: Hoo-boy, trying to add any replies has only summoned the troll brigade, so let me add one retort to all of the comments saying ""OP dumb not no wat antitrust is."" The original post says that these install sizes appear ""to me"" to be exploiting an antitrust loophole in order to discourage competition. The same can be said of several ""live service"" games with install size bloat. The lazy optimization feels like learned helplessness, and the push by Activision with an ""optimization roadmap"" like damage control due to backlash. There is no reason for a shooter with small maps to be this size. There is no reason to allow a ""but our abusive skin store takes space"" as a reasonable excuse either. There is no reason to say ""hard drives are cheap"" is an excuse or ""blame console makers"" as an excuse. This all reeks of Activision being aware the sheer number of younger and poorer gamers that will be forced into an ecosystem by intentional bad design.

I love how their react to your choices. When they criticize you if you killed off a character, or praise you if you get the good ending. They feel so genuine and alive. I hope more games make these type of characters

""Sales not important? Then player review must not be important either. Take this negative review. GOTY doesn’t have to meet sales targets? I’ll never buy Larian games again.”

So on the first day, you needed to simply unlock at least one achievement in any one game. Day two required unlocking at least one achievement in any two different games. And so on.

The contest started with 2805 entrants. There are four left. Today is day 151.

That's right, these four madlads unlocked an achievement in 150 DIFFERENT games yesterday. And in 149 different games they day before. They will all likely unlock achievements in 151 games today.

1f0wiyl,gaming,Pirates might be the most cursed setting in gaming history ,"Even ""western"" got an amazing franchise... 
The only good pirate games are either ancient (aged really bad) or not focused on pirates. 

For some reason the industry went ""oh yeah, I know what a pirate game should be, an online only half assed game with annoying mechanics, microtransactions and PvP"".    

All i want is good naval combat that's SEMI-realistic (not too much), interesting exploration mechanics, build your own crew/fleet. Maybe add some good first person combat i'd love that.

All those who keep saying Sea of Thieves not only ignored my second paragraph but bless you for not knowing any better, that must be what makes you enjoy that game. Man O' War and Tempest were two games with great potential but one was abandoned and one just didn't deliver 

PS: there was no need of mentioning AC black flag we obviously all played it and enjoyetd it. Still polluted by that AC content and especially the modern parts... Ew...",10914,2337,1724593078,Negative,0.476,neutral,0.523
1d0rtms,gaming,I'm beginning to suspect that Roblox is 98% garbage. Am I missing something?,"My daughter (8 years old) has been asking for Roblox for a while. Most of her friends play it and it's such a popular game, I figured it had to have some value. After all, I think Minecraft is a fantastic game with lots of opportunities for creativity and quality interactions with friends, so I assumed Roblox was on a similar level.

I started playing Roblox with my daughter, and holy cow, it is 98% money grabs. Much like the low-effort mobile games that constantly prompt microtransactions. Am I missing something, or is Roblox just complete garbage? There are a few games like Doors that aren't too bad, but my daughter is, of course, gravitating towards the high-dopamine-triggering pay-to-win type games.

In the meantime, I've limited her time on it and explained my reasoning, but I'd love to maybe find some decent games that she enjoys playing and that aren't pure cash-grabbing fluff. Thanks in advance for any suggestions.",10817,1671,1716691396,Positive,0.385,neutral,0.647

1etmun4,gaming,Being forced to replay a game to get the TRUE ENDING is lazy design/storytelling.,"I am so sick of all these games that don't give you the whole story in one playthrough.  You spend so many hours getting through the game only to find out if you want the TRUE ENDING you need to play through the game AGAIN!!!  On top of that you need to usually do some vague action(s) or find a new set of items you might miss but basically just playing through the same stuff you already did.

How about you craft a one-go story that takes you through the game and gives you the entire story in one playthrough?!  It's a super lazy design and storytelling.  It's one thing if you have DLC that adds on to the base game and you can just continue on past the last boss(ie: Asura's Wrath).  

Most egregious are games like Kunitsu Gami.  Really enjoyed the game but if you want to fight the TRUE boss you need to play through a 2nd time where nothing new happens other than a difficulty increase.  They could literally have just included the true boss on at the end of the first playthrough and that'd be it.  I'm playing Afterimage now, a metroidvania, and hearing already that you need to play through NG+ and do some other quests to get the true ending.

Maybe I'm alone in this but being forced to replay the same content to get the real story is not fun for me, it becomes a chore and significantly lowers the fun factor of a game.

Never have I had such a shady and trash experience than I did with 2K games.

I bought NBA 2k17 sometime in 2018 and I LOVED it. I was lost in that game for months with my friends. We spent hundreds of hours leveling and putting work into our characters to get them all the badges and everything to make them top notch.

Then after those characters were good to go we spent 100$ each to boost new characters.

We also spent a decent chunk of money on the card system. You could play games with the characters attached to your cards, it was really cool, and the cards had rarities so that made it even more fun when you found those amazing ruby or emerald cards... So fun!

Then it happened. NBA 2k19 came out and they announced they would be shutting down 2k17 servers. You couldn't transfer anything. You lost all your cards(Aren't cards supposed to be collectible items? wtf?) Your characters were gone... The only thing you could now do in this game was play straight up team vs team basketball which if I was gonna do that I'd just go play NBA Jam for the Sega Genesis... I want The Park... I want my card team. But nope. It's gone...

Every time a new NBA game comes out they just scrap all your work and anything you've spent money on from the game 2 years prior. It's honestly thievery at its finest.

Imagine buying something and just TWO years later it's gone and you can't play it anymore.

I honestly can't believe I never see 2K games get put on blast for this shitty terrible behavior, but it's no better than what ubisoft is doing these days, so I'm letting people know.

I feel like part of it is the predictability factor/lack of originality in gaming.  Just played the first 20 minutes of the Dead Space remake and although I could see the appeal I just didn't feel immersed in the game.  I just sat there thinking ""Oh, and this jump scare will pop up here...and I was right....and then I'll think I'm safe but monster will appe...yup, there he is"".  And this didn't always happen for me.  Historically I've been really bad at predicting what would happen next in a game/movie/show.  I remember constantly being surprised by things in games growing up but now I feel a really big lack of originality in what I play.  There are exceptions over the last 5 years for me (What Happened To Edith Finch, Persona 5, Final Fantasy Remake, HZD) but I can't count how many games I've installed, played 30 minutes of and then just walked away.  I remember visceral feelings from running through Link To The Past, Gears of War 1 and Arkham Knight.  I miss that.

Why is it when I open my mouth on ANY game, I get abuse?

I don't get to experience the entire genre of gaming the same way men do because I was born a woman?

I'm so tired of logging in online and finding it easier to PRETEND to be a man and type only to participate in games I'd otherwise have enjoyed fully.

I'm completely gated off of anything that uses public voip

I want other gamers to finally realise how horrendously bad gaming is for us now. I loved Dark and Darker, but I couldn't engage in the entire VOIP aspect that made it unique.

I loved raiding in WoW, but never in voice. Because the one time I did try it was insinuated I was sleeping with the raid leader.

The only two games I've found where I can reliably find other women to game with, is Lethal Company and FFXIV. And that's mostly because FFXIV has a community that is actively inclusive. 

Which is the ONLY game I've seen take action when someone goes out their way to target me with words exclusively due to the fact I'm a woman

It was a decent little time-waster and provided a great foundation for mods like Sim Settlements to expand on. But, knowing that game development requires careful priorities, I feel that it's inclusion has sabotaged the core of Bethesda Game Studios' game design.

**Bethesda games all thrive on the same core gameplay loop: Explore -> Fight -> Loot -> Sell -> Repeat.** 

For that reason, **expanding the quality and quantity of combat encounters, landscapes, dungeons, loot, enemies and NPCs is the #1 thing BGS can do when developing a new title.** Things like quests fit well into this structure, because they tend to involve the same loop with slightly more guided exploration.

**FO4's settlements, sadly, do not fit in this loop.** They involve taking what would have been junk loot in prior BGS games and converting them into base-building materials. Your settlements have barely any narrative relevance and disrupt the flow of exploration by compelling you to return when they come under attack. If the goal was to have more access to vendors, then having more existing towns would have been a better approach (especially given how memorable the towns in Fallout 3 were).

**Settlements also partly contributed to the flawed concept of Fallout 76**: A game based around resettling the wasteland that heavily emphasized base building. While 76 finally seems to be on the ascent, I still think the vast majority of BGS fans would have preferred 76 to be a single player game with a polished core gameplay loop (or skipped altogether).

**This snowballed into a big part of what went wrong with Starfield, a features-bloated game that not only featured the return of base-building, but also ship-building and space combat. Again, none of these features are a problem in a vacuum, but they're just not worth the time and resources when the core loop suffers from their inclusion**. Starfield's exploration was anemic, its dungeons were single instances copy-pasted 1000 times, its loot was poorly balanced and its shops were multiple loading screens away. Bethesda had the wrong priorities with this game.

Please, Bethesda, ditch these diversions and go back to what made your games fun. If Elden Ring, The Witcher 3, Baldur's Gate 3, and Skyrim itself didn't need base building to take the industry by storm, then why the hell would TES:VI need it?",8901,2148,1714488847,Neutral,0.483,disgust,0.452

1e30pcx,gaming,I aggregated more than 700 greatest games lists. Here are the results.,"# The Data

The source data includes any list from a reliable source and chosen primarily by the publication's editorial staff (lists based on reader polls were excluded). More than 100 publications from \~15 different countries are represented. A few lists have platform restrictions but the vast majority are unrestricted. The method is able to handle ranked lists, unranked lists, partially ranked lists, and lists with a one-per-series restriction, so all of these have been included. In total there are 98 all time lists, 51 end of decade lists, \~570 end of year lists (this includes GOTY awards), and 9 miscellaneous lists. A full list of all of the included source data can be found here: [https://www.acclaimedvideogames.com/lists/](https://www.acclaimedvideogames.com/lists/)

# The Method

Lists are weighted according to their age (newer lists are very slightly favoured), and a reputation score assigned to each publication (all of the big gaming publications have the maximum reputation score). Another weighting is then applied that essentially penalises publications for repeating themselves across multiple lists. This prevents the most prolific publications from dominating the final rankings. Then, a program tracks how often each game appears ahead of every other game on lists that they were both eligible for. The matchups on the resulting table are then rigorously cross referenced to determine which games performed the best overall. In short, the games at the top are the ones that consistently beat other highly ranked games, while rarely losing to lower ranked games.

# The Results

The full list goes all the way to 1000 and can be found here: [https://www.acclaimedvideogames.com/games/alltime/](https://www.acclaimedvideogames.com/games/alltime/) Copying the entire list would take up far too much space, but here's the top 100:

# Background info and where to from here?

This is a project that I've been working on since early 2020. I started it because the current go to sources for gauging the critical consensus on video games, specifically Metacritic and OpenCritic, are both based on review scores. I felt like there was room for a website with a rigorous methodology that ranks games based on lists as well (for some reason there's a slight difference between games that do well in reviews and games that do well on lists). It's still early days (the website only launched last year), but I'd really like for the rankings to be taken somewhat seriously one day. Here's hoping.

The next big project will be adding more platform lists. This won't change much at the top of the list, but it should provide better resolution further down. It may also allow me to increase the list to 1500 games, which would be a nice bonus. It won't happen quickly as it requires a ton of data entry, as well as possibly writing a more careful eligibility checker (the current one is pretty good, but it doesn't always make good guesses when release dates are unknown), but hopefully I'll have at least some of it done by the end of the year. Besides that, I'll be updating to include any important lists that come in. Certain website features also need a bit of attention.

The website is not monetised in any way. There are no ads, affiliate links, subscription options, or donation pages. It will remain that way for the foreseeable future.

1do03t3,gaming,"My GF bought me an Xbox 360 and it reminded me of why I love gaming, then I played Destiny 2 and it reminded me why I hate modern gaming","A few months ago I was talking to my girlfriend about how much fun I remember having playing games like Halo, Gears of War, and CoD(Pre 8th gen games) with friends and I started looking for an Xbox 360 to play some of those games with her. My bday is coming up in a few days and she surprised me with an Xbox 360 she found on Offer Up. 

The Xbox was so great and in amazing conditions. we immediately got and set up and started playing some of the digital and physical games I still had laying around (Mostly Halo games) and it was such a blast. Being able to put a disk in and knowing that we had plenty of content for years without having to worry about updates, no BS microtransations being thrown at your face, couch coop for almost every game. Everything was just fun, no need for bs matchmaking, buying battle passes, or any non sense, just plug and play.

I know many may think this was just nostalgia, but I urge anyone who misses the old style of games to go back, get an older console with a couple of controller and have friends over. As fun as playing games like Helldivers, or any modern game online is, nothing will ever beat the nonsensical fun you can have with 4-8 people playing in a LAN party on Halo 3 forge looking for dumb stuff to do or simply playing Halo, Gears, even the Lego games coop with your partner and having a blast, laughing, messing around, all that nonsense.

Today marked the first day since we got the 360 that we decided to hop back on PC's and play some games, the new Destiny expansion just came out and we have been fans of the franchise since the original came out so we decided to come back (note: We had plaid last season and are simply coming back to the game after 2-3 weeks of not playing). We got in, loaded up our Warlocks, and my god, was it bad.

First, as is traditional with destiny when you load up the game after an expansion or season starts, we start the first mission of the Final Shape, and... it was disappointing to say the list, the environments where mostly recycled accets from Destiny 1 and some maps from 2's multiplayer, the story, as it has been since they started doing the seasons, was a bunch of nonsense that made no sense to us even after playing every expansion the game has ever seen, (thanks to the seasonal stories locked behind the battle passes). and after completing that, we were welcomed by screen after screen trying to sell us stuff. Well I had to actively go out of my way to go into the xbox store to find the dlcs for Black Ops to play on some Zombies maps (which btw where only $14 USD) destiny was just trying to sell me a stupid cat emote for $10 and their expansion for the same price as a full game.

To make things worst, everything was completely different, bounties were moved to the pathway stuff they created, the activity levels where much higher than our initial levels, and there was just absolutely nothing to do. We ended up both deciding to uninstall the game.

I feel like many people are fed up with modern gaming, but going from playing those older og Xbox titles like Halo CE, 2, Medal of Honor, Turok Evolution(as trashy and buggy as that game can be), and 360 tittles, like Halo 3-Reach, Gears 1-3, CoD 4-Bops2, to playing games like destiny just makes the problem so much more infuriating and obvious.

Have you guys gone back to older games recently? how did it feel? what is it that you love the most from those games and what do yo miss the most?",7870,1571,1719300086,Positive,0.988,surprise,0.931

My wife, brother, sister, and myself have been playing a co-op on Stardew valley the last few months. We chill, BS about day/week, and overall are just enjoying the new 1.6 update. 

This week, we had the husband of my cousin beg us to join the game. It's kind of awkward as we are in year 2 of the playthrough and most of the farmland has been taken up. But we made room so the guy can play with us. It started out well, but then he started griping about not having resources so we pitched in with quality sprinklers, mid level gear, and seed money. My sister sent him 10k in game and he didn't say too much. 

Last night, the dude straight up starts sending people 50k. We started asking ""Bro, are you using mods, or cheating?"". He starts answering in a a smartass tone and acting like he's doing us all a favor. We drill into him somemore on why he's doing this in Stardew of all games and we get ""I'm behind, gotta grind for those tools"". He then proceeds to ghost us on sleeping into the next day. We ended up losing a whole day of progress and an ostrich egg. 

Our group chatted over the few hours day and decided he's out. If you want to do that on your own playthrough, cool. But to yolo cheat with money and try to ruin our chill time without even asking, and then outright ghosting people is some bullshit.

1hiueuw,gaming,Finally bought Elden Ring...and I'm not sure it's for me.,"I'm at 118 minutes, so deciding if I want to refund. 

I enjoy RPGs and open worlds, especially ones that have lots of things to find and explore, and where you become more powerful as you do so. 

Maybe I'm just not good at souls-like games, but the timing of everything seems to be arbitrary. Sometimes I feel like I see an enemy make a move and it's slow, and other times they triple hit me with no warning. 

I am at what is essentially the start of the game by this big gate. There is a big monster guy through the gate I was able to get to about 1/2 health before I died. The other direction is a little encampment of soldiers where I snuck around and backstabbed a number of them, but then the captain guy kicked my ass. I have tried about 10 times to kill the captain and no matter how I try to roll, I end up flat footed and he comes in with a triple strike. 

I've increased Vigor 2 times so far, and I figure I can kind of ""farm"" this little area and increase a bit more, but I doubt it'll be enough to really help much, and it'll just make my future upgrades for damage that much more expensive. 

There are a zillion guides online, but most of them are about where to go and what to do and they assume you're not getting killed by the first enemies you meet. 

I played some Dark Souls and got to 4 kings before the edition I had basically shut down, and I've played a lot of Monster Hunter which has ""slow weapons"" but I am wondering if maybe this just isn't going to click. I kept hearing that ""even if you don't like soulslike games this is still accessible"" and I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong.



Edit; thanks for the massive amount of feedback and tips :) I'm going to keep it and explore in the other direction and stop using ""RPG logic"" where I feel like I have to fight every enemy I see cause they might have something good or whatever. It was $35 which isn't nothing, but that's the same as a bottle of whiskey which is no good for my health anyway so I'll skip drinking for a while and make myself lightheaded with the game instead :)


Edit 2: okay. I now have 15 hours in and while I don't know if I'm going to finish the game in the end, I'm definitely enjoying it after taking a bunch of advice here. I wandered around a bunch southward, got some upgrades, fought a few field bosses and eventually won, killed Margit in some jolly cooperation, and really finding I need to throw away some of my RPG conventions like ""kill an enemy if they're on your path because they're probably your level"". Don't love close quarters fights so I'm avoiding going into stormveil much after trying to make my way in the side entrance so going to the peninsula to wander some more and see what I can do about giant turtle bell monastery thing.

1hmknwg,pcgaming,The 23 steps of purchasing my kid a Sony PC game on Steam for Christmas,"Back in my day (yep), you got a game for Christmas, you opened the box, you installed it from the physical media in the box, and you played it. 3 steps, roughly, if my counting fingers are still good in my advancing years.

In 2024, you get a PC game for Christmas, and this is what happens:

1. Santa purchases a digital license for a game.
2. Child receives game and installs it. Parent leaves, thinking child will be happy with their new game.
3. Child opens the game, is greeted with a message that they need a Sony account (in addition to their age-appropriate Steam account, which is in addition to their age-appropriate Google account needed to have an email address and their age-appropriate Microsoft account to have access to Windows).
4. Child calls for parent that they need a Sony account.
5. Parent clicks through ""child account creation"" page, which requires an adult account to provision.
6. Parent forgets their adult Sony login information (we're on a PC, not a PS5), has to look up their credentials, which are locked behind MFA on their phone.
7. Parent must satisfy Sony MFA via emailed auth code.
8. Parent signs in -- must re-auth email for the adult account (despite MFA already using said email).
9. Parent signs up for child account.
10. Parent must verify child email by signing into child Gmail account.
11. Parent must provide payment info to demonstrate that they are an adult. $0.50 must be charged to their adult-shaped credit card.
12. Parent enters credit card info.
13. Parent agrees to the $0.50 transaction using newly added credit card.
14. Unknown Error
15. Parent agrees to $0.50 transaction.
16. Unknown Error
17. Parent uses semi-child-appropriate curse word (""for crap's sake"") signs out of adult account, signs back in, finds where to create a child account, goes back through child account creation, agrees to $0.50 transaction. Success.
18. Parent must specify child account settings (age limits, etc). 1 or 2 EULAs here.
19. Parent goes back to game, signs in as child with new child account.
20. Parent must verify email account with MFA token sent to child account email.
21. Error
22. Retry. Probably another EULA. Success.
23. Child plays game

Literally, this is the process I went through to get Lego Horizon Adventures working on my kids PC via Steam. It was INSANE. I've been gaming my whole life and the way things have gone is just so depressing and so dystopian. It's a goddamn video game. I felt like I was trying to get a car loan!

Obviously the answer here is ""just sign up as an adult"" or better ""don't buy Sony PC games,"" but this is the ""proper"" method that Sony wants their PC customers to follow. It's *unhinged*. I'm not the type of person to pick a specific game launcher or bandwagon hate on whatever is the hot topic to hate at the moment, but boy howdy did this experience make it plain to me how godawful things have gotten.

i tried playing it, and honestly those two cringe cut scenes are the least should be concerned of. The writing for the whole game just felt too safe, a big departure from previous DA. Even DA:I is not this safe.

The criticism ""feels like there's a HR in the room."" is absolutely legit and fair. Heck, even Varric manner of speech and behaviour are toned down. Most of cut scenes interaction felt like I'm watching conversations between corporate employees. There are moments some characters tried to be snarky, but it didn't deliver because it sounded like insults to jab at work colleagues.. which weird for a medieval fantasy. 

But, the character creation deserves respect, particularly face sliders. Super fun to mess around with. I spent hours on character creation menu.

Combat, well, it tried to be ME3 but ends up clunky because it combines DA:I action/strategy combat mechanics with ME3 fast-paced shooter feel. The dodging mech is particularly clunky if you're playing as a mage. Also, it feels too Fortnite-ish---the characters movements in particular when they executing combos or casting spells...it has that typical battle royale game feel to it.

1hdoypx,pcgaming,Swen Vincke's (Baldur's Gate 3 Director) TGAs speech was remarkable,"Last night at The Game Awards, Swen Vincke, the director of Baldur's Gate 3 gave a shocking speech that put's many things into perspective about the video game industry.

This is what he said:

""The Oracle told me that the game of the year 2025 was going to be made by a studio, a studio who found the formula to make it up here on stage. It's stupidly simple, but somehow it keeps on getting lost. Studio made their game because they wanted to make a game that they wanted to play themselves. They created it because it hadn't been created before.

They didn't make it to increase market share. They didn't make it to serve as a brand. They didn't have to meet arbitrary sales targets or fear being laid off if they didn't meet those targets.

And furthermore, the people in charge forbade them from cramming the game with anything whose only purpose was to increase revenue and didn't serve the game design. They didn't treat their developers like numbers on a spreadsheet. They didn't treat their players as users to exploit. And they didn't make decisions they knew were shortsighted in function of a bonus or politics.

They knew that if you put the game and the team first, the revenue will follow. They were driven by idealism and wanted players to have fun. And they realized that if the developers didn't have fun, nobody was going to have any fun. They understood the value of respect, that if they treated their developers and players well, those same developers and players would forgive them when things didn't go as planned. But above all, they cared about their game because they loved games. It's really that simple, said the Oracle.""

🤔 This reminds me of a quote I heard from David Brevik, the creator of Diablo, many years ago, that stuck with me forever, in which he said that he did that game because it was the game he wanted to play, but nobody had made it.

❌ He was rejected by many publishers because the market was terrible for CRPGs at the time, until Blizzard, being a young company led by gamers, decided to take the project in. Rest is history!

1d1rp1c,pcgaming,Your Steam library should be inheritable if you are American,"I keep seeing articles popping up explaining how the inheritance of Steam accounts is impossible due to Valve's subscriber agreement and that there is nothing that can be done about it legally speaking. You should know that if you're American, there are already laws in place in many states that can let you bequeath your Steam account  and other game libraries regardless of what Valve or anyone else write in their EULA.

Revised Uniform Fiduciary Access to Digital Assets Act (RUFADAA) allows a digital executor to stand in your place online should you die or become incapacitated. Essentially, RUFADAA allows you to specify in your will who can access and manage your online accounts as well as the level of access that they would have. The level of access you can grant in your will ranges from transferring full ownership of your accounts to only allowing your executor to close your accounts after your death. I made this thread to discuss Steam accounts, but the legislation allows you to bequeath all your digital assets which include social media profiles, dating profiles, emails accounts, subscription service accounts (which would cover things like Steam, Xbox, PS, Amazon accounts) and more.

As of right now, I cannot find a case of someone using this law to request access to a Steam account, but just because the law has not been tested in a specific way, it does not mean that such a request is unlikely to succeed. At the moment it is much easier to just give your password to your family instead of going through a long legal process, but it is only a matter of time before this  problem reaches the courts as gamers age, making digital inheritance a bigger issue. The process of transferring a Steam account might be expensive due to legal fees and you might need a court order if Valve is uncooperative but you should remember that if you live in America, as long as you make sure to consult a lawyer and include your digital assets in your will, you are not powerless.

I have included some links to pages which explain RUFADAA in more detail as well as which states the law has been passed in. If digital inheritance is something you care about I really suggest you give them a read.

The multi-million selling Vampire Survivors, in fact, doesn't have a publisher. Yet, it's still involved in Bundles and even featured in an official Balatro reskin.

However, there are HUGE benefits to having a publisher:  
If you have an aversion to self-promotion and advertising.  
If you don't want to do all the work vis-a-vis Steam exposure.  
If you have a semi-niche mid-good game and you want to fall back on Bundles and promotions for sales boosts.  
If you want someone else dealing with the press.

But, when I click on the name of a developer in Steam and a Publisher page pops up, I close the page. Yes, immediately, I close the page.

Publishers: You don't own your developers. Nobody who clicks the developer link is looking for other games you've published. Get the fuck over yourselves and let us see that this is the only game the dev has on Steam or THE REST OF THEIR GAMES.

1enytjd,pcgaming,Quitting my job to make games & becoming a father was not the easiest combo. But getting a daily deal & seeing your game on front page of Steam makes it all worth it.,"Hey all,

Around 3 years ago I quit my job to pursue a career of full-time indie gamedev. I had recently released a semi-successful game called Mortal Glory, so I wasn't completely unprepared. After quitting my job, I was so excited about being able to spend all my working hours doing what I love and the feeling of freedom I experienced was exhilarating.

Over time I learned it's not all fun and games though. I spent 17 months making my second game and despite getting good reviews, the game ended up being a financial flop. It still earned a profit, but I was making less than a minimum wage doing work that is often challenging and comes with the extra weight of being an entrepreneur. Over time the sales kept dwindling down and financial anxiety started to creep in. The feeling of having to make a game that NEEDS to make money is not a fun feeling. It also didn't help that I knew that I didn't need money just for my own survival. Me and my wife were expecting a baby.

A few months later I was fortunate enough to become a father to a healthy baby girl. Becoming a parent came with its own distractions and there were many sleepless nights, but I kept working on my next game the best I could. Making my third game ended up taking 17 months, the same as my previous game (I actually wanted to finish it within \~10 months, but your first, second or even third estimate is never correct...). In March of 2024 it was time to release the game and... it was a hit!

The game launched with good reviews and good sales (for a solo dev). Thanks to the release going well, I was able to keep working on the game and after a few months, I actually received my first ever daily deal slot from Steam. This means that a game gets to stay 24 hours on the front page of Steam. I had been trying to get one for a long time but I was always turned down previously - so yeah, I was pretty excited to get it... I had a big free update & a DLC launch coming up so I thought that was the perfect day for the deal. That day was 2 days ago and here's what it looked like: [https://imgur.com/a/5pGdYRq](https://imgur.com/a/5pGdYRq). It's pretty crazy to see your own little game on the front page of Steam next to big titles. Moments like that really make all the struggles worth it.

This post became a lot longer than I intended, but I felt compelled to write it. Being an indie dev is hard and it's not something that I would lightly recommend. But it does have its moments.

Here is the game if you are interested - it's a turn-based gladiator roguelike. I wish I had the sense to write this post when it was on the front page, but a picture will have to do now (the discount from the daily deal is still active though).

In the 10 years before GTA Online, Rockstar put out 20 new games.

In the 10 years since GTA Online, Rockstar has put out…one. One single new game.

So…I guess this isn’t a problem for those big into GTAO but for the rest of us who prefer single player, open world experiences this seems to have been a big loss.

This is nothing against GTAO and its players. I just wish Rockstar would do both. Personally I’m waiting for more single player Red Dead experiences and we are likely a depressing number of years away from anything new there.🥺",1469,351,1716863009,Neutral,0.503,neutral,0.824

Here are some things you might not know about Greg Coomer.

* He worked with Gabe Newell at Microsoft before joining Valve in 1997 as one of its first employees.
* He helped to name the company Valve, designed the company's website. He also was one of the people who worked on the legendary Valve intro for Half-Life and beyond.
* His [face](https://combineoverwiki.net/wiki/Greg_Coomer#/media/File:Greg_coomer.jpg) was one of several that designers used as a reference for Gordon Freeman’s model. 
* Coomer worked on every single Half-Life title as a game designer and/or art director.
* You can see his surname in the [Half-Life Locker room](https://www.reddit.com/r/HalfLife/comments/kzz0tl/hmmm_is_that_why_hes_always_in_the_bathroom/).
* He did the HL2 tech demo [presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ddJ1OKV63Q&t=491s&ab_channel=muffinhunter).
* He was one of the designers for both Steam Machine, and Steam Deck. 

While Gabe Newell is a prominent figure, it's crucial to remember that Valve is built by a team of incredibly talented individuals who deserve just as much credit for shaping the gaming world. ",1420,88,1732034030,Neutral,0.693,neutral,0.355

I decided to cancel the update and do some googling, only to [find out that my headset will now be completely useless](https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1amxowz/psa_windows_mixed_reality_wmr_headsets_no_longer/). It's a really old, outdated headset (the very first HP WMR headset, not a Reverb model), but it is still something I used occasionally. While I understand that VR is extremely niche and WMR headsets even more niche, the fact that functional hardware can just be killed off like this is just plain unacceptable. If there was an open-source alternative that kept these alive, I would be ok with this, but as far as I understand there isn't.

Instead of just killing off WMR, Microsoft should have just created a driver for these headsets to become SteamVR native headsets instead. Everyone who ever used a WMR headset already hated the Mixed Reality Portal anyway and booted straight into SteamVR instead.

I'm hoping there's some sort of class action lawsuit against Micosoft for how they are handling this. Let's not forget the environmental impact this will have with people just carelessly throwing their headsets in the trash once they realize they no longer serve their function.

If passed by gaining 1 million EU signatures before July 31, it would address the legally untested practice of whether publishers can design games and digital content so that they can expire after an arbitrary length of time. This would also act as a bolster for digital consumer rights and ownership and stop online-only dependency spreading to other industries (extra citations)

You need to manually navigate folders to delete settings and activation file, then deny it's connection in firewall. Then the game will finally work...

https://steamcommunity.com/app/1233570/discussions/0/7735567784591225152/

Edit 3: Maybe that's it! If you had the game activated before the servers went down, it works. I just got the game and maybe the license can't be activated. Some have the problem, some don't and it's very strange.

Edit 4: for people having this problem, a user called               u/ChekeredList71 provided this info:

""I found this in the game's Steam ratings:
  
The game forces you to watch a few minutes long intro cutscene when you start it that can't be skipped (even before you're allowed to see or change anything at the main menu). The game then gets stuck in an infinite loading screen before you're allowed to change anything else.  
  
Apparently the game is trying to connect online to EA servers to validate a Denuvo DRM token, or sync saves.... Except these cheap tw@ts have already closed the servers down, so there's nothing to connect to, & you just get stuck loading forever.  
  
This is precisely why DRM/online services suck (along with their utter trash EA App that no one needs or wants).  
  
  
1. C:\\Users\\YOURUSERNAMEHERE\\Documents\\Mirrors Edge Catalyst Go to Documents, & delete the settings/save folder.  
  
2. C:/ProgramData/Electronic Arts/EA Services/License/1026480.dlf Go here & delete this file; which is the Denuvo DRM token for this game (it's trying to connect online to servers that don't exist anymore to verify this). If you delete this, then it should attempt to create an offline token instead (assuming you follow the next steps correctly).  
  
3. Start Mirror's Edge Catalyst from Steam, as soon as the game window pops up (NOT before then, or the game won't start), immediately either firewall the game & block its internet access, or disconnect your wi-fi/ethernet.  
  
4. If you can skip the intro, then you'll be able to play the game. If you can't skip it, then you've probably failed one of these steps.  
  
PS - You have to repeat step 3 every time you want to play the game, otherwise I think it might mess up your settings files! (I'm not going to test it to find out lol). You can re-enable internet once you're in-game, & playing; though the game might nag you with ""Game can't connect to our servers"" message that pops up every now & again whilst you play. Also, I don't think achievements work either (for anyone that cares about that sort of thing).""",1199,160,1719298111,Negative,0.484,neutral,0.909

> Anticheat added to EA WRC, blocking the steam deck / proton. Patch notes: ""Additionally, EA SPORTS™ WRC will not run on the native Steam OS for Steam Deck following the release of EA anticheat."" 

I've posted this on /r/SteamDeck and /r/linux_gaming, but I think it's not getting the attention it deserves.  The game has been functioning perfectly on the Steam Deck and Linux since it released in November last year.  As of two weeks ago, the game has been updated to include EA's own kernel-level anticheat, which now blocks the game from running on the Steam Deck and Linux, and prevents software like [ReWASD](https://www.rewasd.com/blog/post/remapping-as-a-key-to-gaming-accessibility) from running.  

**This isn't fixable by the Proton devs either,** as it outright blocks you with a popup that explains how the Deck and Proton are unsupported, and trying to circumnavigate this block could result in some form of ban from the anticheat.  I'm not sure what other software is on their blacklist aside from ReWASD.

The game is only multiplayer in the form of leader boards.  There's no way to launch the game offline/without the anticheat.  **I've also been unable to get a refund on steam as my playtime is over two hours,** even though I can no longer play the game at all, and this seems like the situation for a lot of people.  *I was also banned from /r/EASPORTSWRC because I replied to a CM comment telling them they've stolen my money.*

Linux and ReWASD issues aside.  Apparently this anticheat update brings in a lot of bugs, with lots of reviews claiming they can either no longer run the game, it's crashing, or VR isn't working at all, or the game won't connect to their servers, etc etc.  See steam reviews and /r/EASPORTSWRC for more detailed posts on bugs people are encountering.

1h4gog6,pcgaming,"Star Wars Jedi Survivor & Fallen Order are still broken on PC, do not let the dark side tempt you with sales","In light of the all the sales now til the end of the year, here's a little reminder or notice if you're unfamiliar:

Jedi Survivor and Fallen Order infamously suffer from shader and traversal stutters. These occur on *every* PC, regardless of hardware or whether you're able to notice them. There are other bugs too, like white flashing when turning corners/the camera, flickering lights, and even basic things like menu settings not engaging. Is DLSS on or is your PC just that bad? Who knows! 

To get you caught up, here's Digital Foundry's analysis of the most recent [Jedi Survivor Patch 9 - Improved but still very poor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=smD4okK5-Hw) by Alex Battaglia, preeminent expert on PC game performance and leader in the #StutterStruggle. 

So, while Patch 9 improved shader comp and shader stutter, **both Jedi Fallen Order and Jedi Survivor *still* to this day suffer from shader compilation and travel stutter.** **Everyone** on PC will encounter several types of stuttering, *regardless of how good the hardware.* There's also **[animation stutter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=smD4okK5-Hw&t=573)**, which affects camera movement and character animations. A triple threat stutterer!

I can also vouch that the issues occur on the current fastest CPU for gaming, the 9800x3D, which I use OC'd to 5.7Ghz and run with 48gb DDR5-8000 CL40 EXPO, Crosshair X870 Hero, and RTX 4090; all stability tested >24hrs, latest drivers, no issues like this with any other games that aren't also known and common.

Oh, and [even the PS5 Pro version of Survivor is having issues right now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cb9iM1N9Bz8?si=wYfe9swwp0dpR98K). EA is aware and investigating, patch is assumed/confirmed to come soon, but it's just another example of their poor standards.

I don't think it's appropriate to continue rewarding EA's and Respawn's repeated lack of respect for paying customers by spending more money or playtime on these lackluster products. Just means they will continue to reward you with the same or lower standards next time. If as many of us as possible opt not to purchase them, even at a steep discount, they might find our collective lack of faith disturbing enough to fix these issues in the next game, if not the previous.",1091,432,1733095325,Negative,0.85,neutral,0.678

Riot putting the full skin behind 600$ paywall is the biggest insult imaginable to us. Riot chose to exploit our love for Faker for their own gain. 

This was suppose to be something to remember Faker by, when he has retired and proof that we were here and cheering for him when he was still playing and lifted those Trophies. Faker never uses skin probably because he wanted to show the world that you don't need to be rich to be good at the game and be someone great.

Funny thing is, if the bundles were priced around 100$, then at least 6x players would been afford it and had bought it and Riot would have made the money anyways. But the greed at Riot is too short sighted to see that. Do not get FOMO from this.

G2 not only benched me at the end of 2021 during the 1st year of my 3 year contract, but they also made sure that under no circumstances would I go to another LEC team for egoistic reasons (financial / easier competition). 

KC saved me and also did everything they could to help me get back to LEC at the end of 2022 (removing buyout if I agreed to not receive half of my salary for that year). 

FNC then in turn decided to bench me after 4 months of my 2 year contract, trying to get me out after a few weeks already (failing to do so at an earlier time).

T1 saved me once again and is doing everything they can to not only support me during a continuous tough period of my life, but also help me as much as they can to make sure 2025 is a good situation for me.

There are multiple quality issues in regards to the new Samira emote, including:

* 6 fingers
* missing half of the lower lip
* Mismatched detailing on the collar
* Odd ear shading

While there's no certainty that this was made with generative AI, there is certainty that the quality control team dropped the ball with this one.

  
Edit: As I said, there's no confirmation that it was made with AI and it was pure speculation due to some mistakes that are consistent with usual AI issues.

  
LoLDev has released a sketch of it and denies the AI claim, they said that the emote will be fixed:

>I have some important news to share with you about the next chapter of my journey.

>The biggest point of discussion—and what might come as a shock to you—is my decision to leave T1. Now, before everyone reacts, please give me a moment to explain. After hearing my story, I hope it will be easier to understand why.

>When I received the offer from Becker last year to come to Korea and try out for the LCK CL team, I was not in a great place mentally. I had recently been diagnosed as being on the autism spectrum, and combined with a family accident and a couple of tough years since leaving Fnatic in 2020, I was struggling. Because of this, I was actually leaning toward taking a break for the 2024 season. But since it was T1 asking, I knew future Martin would regret not giving it a try. I think we can all agree this was the right decision, but, as expected, it did not fix my issues—it just put them on hold. Now, I believe it is time for me to address those challenges, and to do that, I need to be in Sweden close to my family.

>Thankfully, I have been fortunate to receive an offer that allows me to continue playing professionally in the 2025 season from home. To put it in League of Legends terms, I am finally taking a “recall”—a chance to go back, refill my health and mana, buy some essential items and upgrade my skills before re-entering the map. I left home in 2013 when I was just 16, and now, nearly 12 years later at the age of 28, I get the chance to reset. I want to play for as long as possible, and when I imagine the years ahead, I realize this change could help make that goal achievable. Longevity is incredibly important to me at this stage of my career.

>I know this may feel like a surprising decision, especially after the high of winning Worlds together with ZOFGK + KTR. However I promised myself to stay committed to this plan, regardless of results or temporary emotions. This is me keeping that promise, and I hope you will understand that it comes from a place of wanting to stay in the game and continue improving.

>I will always be grateful for my time with T1, not just for the experience but for how it has helped me grow as a player and a person. Coming to Korea without experience in the role or knowing the language was a challenge, but T1 believed in me anyway. I want to thank my teammates, coaches and staff at T1 HQ for helping me along the way, and to all of our fans for supporting us. It has been an honor to wear the T1 badge.

>Thank you all for being here with me so far, and I hope you will join me for this next chapter as well. I could not do it without your support.

>다시 만나요!

1g020ub,leagueoflegends,The League Wiki is Leaving Fandom,"TLDR: The wiki is leaving Fandom and becoming the official wiki for League in partnership with Riot and Weird Gloop. Find us on our new site: https://wiki.leagueoflegends.com

Hey everyone, on behalf of the editing team on the League wiki, I’m here to announce that we are **leaving Fandom** and launching the **OFFICIAL League of Legends Wiki**! We are doing this in partnership with our new hosts [Weird Gloop](https://weirdgloop.org/), the hosts of the Runescape and Minecraft wikis, and the full support of Riot, who are footing the bill for the server costs.

As many of you know (or have personally experienced), the excessive, shitty ads, pop-ups, and policies on Fandom have made the viewing experience awful and severely limit our ability to deliver our content and theme our wiki. The site is horribly slow and reading is especially painful for our many mobile readers. We’ve wanted to leave Fandom, but it’s possible now thanks to Riot.

Some fun examples of ads: https://youtube.com/clip/Ugkx3hDXNuBN_a7TtbYNPGPC2Paiv6XGbXVn

Riot approached us in early 2024 with the explicit idea of us becoming the official wiki and agreed to pay for our hosting. We ultimately chose to host the wiki on Weird Gloop and receive search engine optimization (SEO) help from them and Riot. We chose Weird Gloop because we have aligned views on making the most player friendly wiki possible and they have been fantastic partners in helping us on the backend.

You can find out more in Riot’s latest [blog post](https://www.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/news/announcements/the-official-league-of-legends-wiki/)!

We are going to continue to cover all content under the League Studio umbrella: the Runeterra IP/universe, League of Legends, Teamfight Tactics, Wild Rift, and Legends of Runeterra. All of our previous content will still be available and it will be the home of all new content as well like new champions, TFT sets, patches, skins, and more.

It will take some time for the new site to show up on search engines, so we highly recommend changing any old links to the new site and updating your bookmarks! You can also install the [Indie Wiki Buddy](https://getindie.wiki/) extension, which lets you ignore Fandom links altogether. The SEO battle won’t be won overnight, so we appreciate any help you give us. On behalf of the wiki team, we thank you all for the support over the years and we'll see you all on the new and improved, ***OFFICIAL*** [League of Legends Wiki](https://wiki.leagueoflegends.com)!

1gq4c12,leagueoflegends,"Teemo top is, legitimately, a degenerate gameplay pattern","It's insane to see people whining about matchups they don't like playing against in different lanes, just to see what sticks. I swear: half the gameplay of League is lobbying Riot for buffs or nerfs with precision harping. Like, really. A tubby middle-aged alcoholic is insurmountable for you? Awww. 

For an actual, objective, concrete, serious 'degenerate gameplay pattern,' want to know one? Teemo. It's 1000% Teemo top. How crazy is it that the first time you enter lane, there's a chance he's already invisible and hiding in the brush? That the first you sense of him will not be the Yordle's visage, but the sound of his feet softly crunching in the grass, the rustle of underbrush passing over his smooth fur, or perhaps his pleasant scent of sunlight mingling with travel-dust and freshly baked scout biscuits? You know he's present and waiting for an opportunity to prick you with his devious blowgun, and there's nothing else for it but to sit there, breathing raggedly, until the Yordle decides to take his shot. 

There shouldn't be champions in the game that inflict such a degree of anticipation that I am having trouble starting at my computer screen. My palms start to sweat, and my vision swims as it darts between bush one, bush two, bush three. Which one? I'm guessing wildly. And he probably loves that. Oh, I bet he loves watching me crumble and panic. I think about what he must think of me--and my thoughts turn towards a place so dark and lost that a control ward's light would quickly be swallowed. Countless times I'll devolve into a quivering, directionless mess against him... his next victim, as he laughs and clenches his fingers around his toxic blowgun, ready to sap my strength and leave me helpless and at his mercy. 

But sure, Gragas, Nocturne, whoever else is toxic because they take advantage of convoluted mechanics or killed you early last game. Against Teemo, he dominates me without even pressing a button. Friendly reminder to not just say stuff to say stuff when it comes to game balance, because it adversely how the game grows over time. Thanks!",7481,236,1731470586,Negative,0.655,disgust,0.436

1gs3rgw,leagueoflegends,"The toplaner ""TheBausffs"" of newly announced team Los Ratones  has been seen inting in soloq","So, like many of you, I was hyped when famous canceller, Caedrel “Sally” Lamont, announced his new team, Los Ratones. The roster? Absolute banger: Nemesis, former FNC midlaner and Rekkles , literal recent world champion, plus some fresh blood like Velja and... uh... Thebausffs

Now, I’ll admit, I was cautiously optimistic. The team seemed like a fun mix: seasoned veterans, hungry rookies, and just enough chaos to make things interesting, the kind of lineup that could pull off a Cinderella story if everything clicked. Naturally, I was curious. I wanted to see what this “professional” side of TheBausffs looked like in action. So, like any rational person, I hopped onto his Twitch stream to get a sense of the guy Caedrel is putting his faith in. And what do I see?

Game 1: Kayn top. 0/11/0  
Okay, okay, everyone has a bad game. It happens, right?

Game 2: Irelia top. 2/14  
Uhm.. maybe he’s testing limits?

Game 3: Fiddlesticks toplane with aftershock*.* 1/12  
??????

I’m starting to think Caedrel picked him as part of a lost bet, or maybe Baus has some dirt on him. How else does a guy locking in Fiddlesticks top with Aftershock end up on a team with Rekkles and Nemesis? Then it clicked, he’s probably the mascot. He’s got the goofy, meme-worthy personality, and if you squint, he even kind of looks like a rat. But can you imagine the voice comms after he runs it down for the seventh time in scrims? “On me guys.”  

So, some 5D chess going on, or inta of the year?

But if you checked their match history, they only played support, almost exclusively with Lulu, but also had a bit of Janna, Soraka and Yuumi on the side.

However, they all had bombass 80%+ winrate Rengars, or Khazix, or Kayns, or whatever really, that they all seem to pull out once every two months or so.

Is it like some kind of pride thing? You know, like playing Rengar is just too easy for them so they have to put on the weights to train their discipline like Rock Lee did in Naruto with his training weights?",4948,202,1730678660,Negative,0.948,disgust,0.5

Yesterday, FA was announced earlier than expected, so I couldn't properly greet you, which was different from my intention, so I feel so sorry about it. I entered as a trainee in 2019 and was so happy to be able to play with such great hyungs until this year. I'm grateful to (ONER) Hyeonjun hyung, who has been through everything with me since I was a trainee, (FAKER) Sanghyeok hyung, who I always learned a a lot from, (GUMAYUSI) Minhyung hyung, who always gave me positive energy, (KERIA) Minseok hyung, who helped me play comfortably, and the team that believed in me and gave me a chance.

It was an honor to receive so much love as a member of T1, and I'm so sorry that I'm leaving so suddenly, even though they gave me so much love. I still can't believe it, but I'm sorry that the fans must have been very surprised.

I am so grateful to the manager who always took good care of me, and to the team leader, and for (T1 COO) Woongki-nim too. I am also so grateful to the coaches who always believed in me and allowed me to learn a lot.

As I have learned so much from T1, I will always try to learn from my shortcomings and become a player who can improve further when I go to other teams. Thank you for reading my ramblings.",4824,921,1732086119,Positive,0.891,sadness,0.968

1e97af8,leagueoflegends,How To Defeat Ignite Players In 2024: By Dying On Purpose,"I'm a challenger top laner since s3, and this strategy emerged when death timer's got reduced in season 13.

Here's how to win solo lane in the most degenerate way possible: Dying on purpose lvl 2.

For those unaware, death timer's dropped by 2 seconds at lvl 2. The death timers from level 1-4 are now 6/6/8/8 (previously 6/8/10/12).That's right, there is no increase to the death timer between level 1 and 2. If you die level 4, it's a whopping 33% decrease in time compared to the past. Here's how to annihilate ignite players by 'feeding' on purpose.

Step 1: This is the hardest part...

Take teleport in Champion Select. It's the purple spell with the guy standing upright. Could be difficult to miss if your brightness is all the way down or you're not wearing your glasses, try your absolute best to left click this spell.

Step2: You're already on your way to snowballing out of control. Make sure to confirm that the enemy took ignite instead of teleport. It looks like a red hand holding a flame. It's Omae wa mou shindeiru for this ignite picker.

Step 3: Now that you're ingame, this is the easy part. You want to die as the cannon minion comes to lane, so that the enemy loses 2 levels worth of exp, for a 2k gold advantage early game.

Here's how to do it:

Focus entirely on hitting the opponent instead of last hitting. You plan on dying anyway and teleporting instantly to freeze. The opponent will last hit minions and thus naturally cause the wave to slow push. Once you're lvl 2. make sure to all in to the death. If the announcer says enemy first blood, pat yourself on the back, you've just won lane. The death timer for level 2 is the EXACT same as level 1, a 6 second fast recall.

This will give time for the cannon wave to come and hold the wave near turret. Once respawned in 6 seconds, immediately teleport back with your full 800 hp/mana. Your opponent will be 1 hp and cannot crash the wave. Slay the fool if they dare step into your domain.

Since the opponent is 1 hp, they must recall, or you will just kill them instantly and still hold the freeze. By the time the opponent has come back, you'll be up 2 levels. Just beat them to a pulp. For good measure, call over your jungler that's level 4 with red buff so he can assist you with beating the ignite player into the dirt for even more gold.

The lane is entirely lost for the ignite top laner. Continue to freeze/slow push waves and trade 1 for 1 anytime by diving them at turret after slow pushing several waves. They'll die and you'll continue to snowball the exp lead to be up 4+ levels.

Play for your lvl 6 spike and kill them again to keep the snowball rolling.

If you managed to do the incredibly hard job of dying level 2 vs ignite, congratulations, your opponent can no longer play the game. Your opponent is seething that they completely lost lane to a guy that died 30 seconds into the game.

August talks about this degenerate teleport strategy here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrEvmL9\_nsA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrEvmL9_nsA)",4778,538,1721629342,Neutral,0.533,neutral,0.706

Full quote: We will defeat them. T1 has a 100% winrate against LPL at worlds in Bo5s. That's only because they haven't faced us yet. Our winrate against LCK at worlds is also 100%, and we have already sent home 2 LCK first seeds. Tomorrow, we need only beat the fourth seed. We have the advantage.""

Question: BLG has always been confident when facing T1, but historically T1 in Bo5 has never lost to LPL at worlds. Why do you think you will be able to beat them? And can you predict what the game score will be?

Another quote from Bin: ""You could say T1 always beats LPL teams at worlds, but I don't care. Because our winrate against T1 in bo5 is 100%. I think tomorrow we will also have a very easy time winning, we will 3-0 them.""

Author of the former post has said it's now about 53% likelihood with the no rematch rule.

I have seen so many comments acting like that if you make top 8, then you won 3 games and you must have unquestionably been 8th place and deserved your spot. (Since people are asking for some examples: here are just a few examples from the past few days: [1](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/1fvhbav/swiss_stage_draw_round_2/lq72lau/) [2](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/1g0mz4u/addressing_the_drama_how_to_lead_a_worldclass/lraukp0/) [3](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/1g1efa8/there_are_8_possible_draws_for_the_last_day_of/lrgw1ba/) [4](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/1fvwffo/2024_world_championship_swiss_stage_round_2_live/lqcp2ac/). I found these by just searching my own profile for a few minutes. I saw plenty others that I never responded to. I'm not gonna act like this is some popular opinion on here, but it's a take you see a lot. A lot of people said it last year too.) It also undoubtedly is remembered in history if a team makes top 8 and the context of it all gets mostly lost to time, especially among casual fans.

I hope this post really makes it clear that this format is not perfect at determining the top 8. We can argue that the entertainment value is worth, it's a fair argument, but it is out of touch with reality to say that top 8 at Worlds is without a doubt the best 8 teams.

I think this is just a funny and memorable way to picture it. The monkeys will make it out because they draw each other and eventually one team will win even if monkeys are controlling the champions.

1dnatdi,leagueoflegends,Hot take: Milking the whales is fine and healthy for the game,"Players, youtubers and every League Subreddit especially love to lose their shit about expensive gacha chromas or the new ahri skin. I dont get it tho. Honestly.

These are products that are very clearly made for whales. Riot said so multiple times. They are the LoL-Equivalent of some 3000€ gucci handbag (whose value is equally as made up as the 450€ ahri skin, regardless of it's a physical good or not). The only difference between a gucci handbag and a 450€ skin is that the money that's generated from the skin benefits and finances everyone who doesn't pay for league. Honestly they could make the coolest skin possible and sell it for 1000€ - i dont care.

If you're rich you get to buy cool pointless shit, thats just how life goes.

There are so many free to play games that are pay to progress or pay to win. Expensive useless cosmetics are a preferrable model for almost all players, no matter the pricepoint. The main part of League are the champions and runes, which have both become MORE accessible over time.

So idk, lynch me if you want but i dont care if they milk the whales. I think it's good even. So what i cant have that one ahri skin. I can also not have a rolex but i still have a watch.

Edit: I agree with everyone who points out that it's in bad faith to make such an expensive skin be marketed as a celebration of such a beloved figure like faker.",4636,2202,1719227087,Neutral,0.446,neutral,0.806

You can now perform the notorious Hashinshin TP once more. You can gank, revive, TP to a minion in your lane, and then die right away when the jungler ganks you again.

1g8zrkq,leagueoflegends,Friendly reminder to stop Leashing your junglers ,"Jungle clear speed will only be effected by like 2-3 seconds if you leash. You risk entirely losing your lane due to no priority. There is no advantage that you can give your jungler that is worth coinflip losing an entire lane. And leashing your jungler not only leaves you at a significant disadvantage but also probably means they will leave you weakside.

The reward of giving your jungler a small advantage is far outweighed by the risk of potentially getting cheesed/outpushed and losing your entire lane. And that's assuming your jungler is even good enough to capitalise on those 2-3 seconds

However. Do guard jungle entrances please. You lose nothing for that",4557,557,1729542158,Negative,0.721,fear,0.71

Does that mean he will play?

Very unlikely, Riot has a requirement for each team to have one substitute player. With the ZOFGK roster, T1 would usually move a coach into this spot just to fill Riot's requirement. They did this with Sky last Worlds and Roach for most of this year.

Dude wrote a whole essay about how high elo was too toxic for him and it opened his eyes to how it wasn't worth his time and decided to uninstall and quit the game permanently. This post garnered 4.5k upvotes

Turns out he just started playing again. He was banned for 2 weeks because he was toxic. This whole time he was spouting how other players were toxic but he's been permanently chat banned on both of his high elo accounts. you can take a guess as to how

Don't trust these type of posts

  
edit: dude deleted his reddit account after being exposed. his post history is visible on some reddit archive sites that i won't post here. before he deleted his accounts, he said he would let his OldMonk account decay to ""prove"" that he quit entirely.

 in this post here from last year that he has another account that's master as well, so what are the chances of him just playing on that one instead? he's already changed the name of that account and i wasn't able to find it but what are your thoughts?

T1 had to face some of the greatest teams to ever do it to win these past 2 world championships. 

JDG was walking the golden road and showed some of the highest peaks of world class team fighting. GENG went 17-1 in both LCK splits, broke the game score record in the LCK, and won MSI. BLG won both spring and summer in the LPL, went to the finals in both MSI and Worlds, and is considered by many as the strongest Chinese 5 stack the LPL has ever had. 

But the team that actually was able to beat T1 at worlds was not any of these teams but a 4th seed that almost didn’t make worlds and had Kingen be the one who out clutched T1 in a game 5. ",4442,460,1730641437,Positive,0.845,surprise,0.514

1ermwrr,leagueoflegends,The new Akali emote is far too powerful for this game.,"Like, the new emotes are cool and all, but the new [Akali emote](https://i.imgur.com/DTovzzn.png) is far too good for this game.

Emotes usually at least attempt to tie into something inside the actual game, like the new smug [Jinx emote](https://i.imgur.com/5ko2b6Q.png) which has a surrender vote and all that, but I really am at a loss at what interaction or game mechanic Akali could be trying to represent with that emote.

It's like, so powerful in every way. You can use it for any purpose. It's sorta like Smug Ashe or Fire Soraka except so much more powerful because of the not-so-hidden message it actually carries.

I feel like Riot outdone themselves with this emote, and it will either be nerfed in the near future or it will completely take over the game.

It's just too good.",4347,519,1723593215,Positive,0.661,neutral,0.785
1clqz9h,leagueoflegends,I just realized what the deal about Jax being a fisher is,"I've been playing League since Open Beta and just realized (to be honest I realized this some weeks ago but I can't live with realizing it almost 15 years later) what the joke about Angler Jax is.

I always just assumed it was some random thought of Riot to give him the Angler skin and him being able to fish in the river (even though this feature was added rather recently)

In his joke he states ""Imagine if I had a real weapon"" - always made sense in his old lore where he was some kind of weapon grandmaster and him having a real weapon would be too powerful and a fishing rod is an easy replacement for a lamp post without being a real weapon so I never thought about it as it was just a fun thing.

Just the other day it dawned on me that they doubled down and gave Jax a ""reel weapon"" and even though I don't know if that is the story behind it, this is the funniest thing to me.

Either I was always just stupid (and/or didn't know about the joke) or they never cared to explain.


tl;dr: Jax has a reel weapon with his Angler Jax skin",4338,152,1715021832,Neutral,0.559,surprise,0.719

1cxdux0,leagueoflegends,Naafiri hasn't even reached one year on the rift and she already became the least picked champion in the game,"[Ziggs mid is less popular but if you combine both Ziggs bot and Ziggs mid, their pickrate is higher than Naafiri](https://preview.redd.it/2psz0nu2ys1d1.png?width=942&format=png&auto=webp&s=d0725c6ee3c8d2889a80b76f07150d746401132e)

Naafiri is a good case on what Riot should avoid in champion design

**1- The end goal was terrible**

*“A while back, our champion design lead, August Browning, did an analysis of our whole roster and categorized each champ by role, class, and difficulty in order to find some opportunity areas for players,” game designer Glenn “Riot Twin Enso” Anderson reveals. “He ended up finding two major holes: a higher skill tank, which ended up being K’Sante, and a relatively simple and beginner-friendly assassin, which became Naafiri.”” -  Naafiri champ insights June 2023*

These were a bit of flawed goals, Tank like K'Sante having so much agency forces him to be permanently bound to being highest presence in pro play despite multiple adjustments, nerfs and reworks so he has to remain as 45% WR while an assassin with literally no skill ceiling gets dropped by mid lane players almost immediately and thus have an abysmal pickrate

**2-""Monster champions have low pickrate"" was used as an excuse to not follow up on Naafiri's post release**

Naafiri was in fact just a check box, community kept asking for a monster champions and Riot wanted to fill the gap in their roster so they just checked both boxes, released the filler champ and moved on to the next project.

They didn't stop to think that maybe the brand new easy/intro champion should at the very minimum have same pickrate as other niche assasins as players should find immediate success when they pick her up

Sure, there is truth to it, if Naafiri had a model that looked like the other darkin champions but female, she would have had higher pickrate but there are also tons of monster champions who are faring well in terms of popularity with much older kits and worse looking models.

**3-Naafiri should have been allowed to jungle**

I can understand why not let her jungle at the first month or two as to push her identity as a mid laner or solo laner but once the dust settled down and mid laners voted with their pickrate  that they don't want to play this absolutely boring kit, Riot should have immediately given some jungle ratios and see how she would fare in the jungle

Riot literally buffed Sylas, Olaf, Zyra, Brand, Sett and others to push them to jungle and attract more pickrate for these champions, but the least popular champion in the game isn't looked at?

I don't see any reason why Naafiri shouldn't have been allowed to jungle, Junglers are more likely to pick up monster champions. If Naafiri would be problematic and very frustrating jungler and get +30% banrate then sure remove her jungle modifiers but at the very least give it a shot and see if her dwindling playerbase would recover from its death spiral

**4- Her kit has an identity issue as she plays like a skirmisher rather than an assassin**

-her engage ability \[W\] is a point and dash that has long channel time and can be blocked by other enemies standing in its path so her back line access is pretty shit specially the higher in MMR you go and enemy team has that knowledge. Diana E for example has the same range of Naafiri until Naafiri hits lvl 11 but she has no cast time and other champions can't block it

the cast time of W gives too much counterplay, any champion with an ounce of hard CC can easily interrupt Naafiri mid dash \[Hwei EQ, Syndra E, Lux Q, etc\]  compare that to the instanteous Diana dash's case where the enemy mid laner has to predict that Diana will dash and throw his CC early to stop Diana mid dash

-she has no escape tools but to compensate she gets shields from her R + on her take downs as well

-The bleed in her kit synergizes with Black Cleaver and Eclipse \[Fighter items\]

-So is she a good skirmisher? not really, she lacks any form of CC whether slows or hard CC, that greatly diminishes her skirmishing

**5- The kit has nothing to master and the narrative is disconnected from the gameplay**

shes literally a nothing burger, she has no skill expression and she gets boring after the third game as her gameplay loop gets very repetitive and boring.

her E is the only redeeming ability in her kit as she dishes out damage at start of the dash and then at the end of the dash, she deals even more damage in an explosion but the fun thing about the abilitiy is that it immediately recalls your dogs and heals them up

her R is you get more dogs and bonus AD + shield, the cool part is that the dogs get a small boost in HP so they could survive getting one shot, I like that part

the champion theme is the pack and half her voice lines are all about unity and how the pack makes her strong and that a lone dog is weak, etc. etc.

where is that pack in her gameplay???

why don't her abilities get some twists depending on how many dogs she has? doesn't have to be more or less numbers in her damage, what makes Naafiri unique from the other 166 champions? its her pack gimmick and nothing else.

**Naafiri has the tools in her kit to protect and heal her pack and but she is punished for protecting her pups as she blows her mana, damage and her cooldown for literally  no gain**

to reiterate, I don't say Naafiri should have been a high skill floor champion but there are lots of champions that have low skill floor and are newbie friendly but also moderate to high skill ceiling to encourage players to main them and not get bored after a few games.

**Closing notes:**

its a shame how Naafiri turned out, her in game model is cool and very different from your average league champion, the dogs AI is smart and I love that they can help you CS and they move smoothly around you, her R animation and sound really sells the whole unleash the pack vibe, the animators, riggers, vfx artists all did a wonderful job.

but the gameplay is horrendous and she is doomed to be the lowest pickrate champ in the game unless she's balanced around having 52% WR and  her pickrate will still be bottom 20 as you can't bribe players with winrate to play this boring ass champion

No other newly released champion in League's history had their pickrate plummet this quickly and sharply after their release

to understand how bad Naafiri pickrate is, it took Rell \~2 years after her release to get the midscope rework and Rell's pickrate pre midscope was higher than current Naafiri.",4063,771,1716313430,Negative,0.468,fear,0.416

According to the naver article linked in this tweet, the reason for Guma’s one year contract is that if all of the players have the same contract length, there’s a risk of the team blowing up at once if no one re-signs at the end of 2026.

Guma, with the mindset of staying with Faker until the end, has set up his contract to align with Fakers and is planning to renew his contract with Faker next year. That way, it not only makes it easier for the others to re-sign at the end of 2026, but if the others end up not doing so, T1 will still have championship contending draw in the form of Faker and Guma for insurance. This will make it easier for others to sign/re-sign because T1 will always have a competitively viable roster. He has also signed with the same agency Faker is in (his agent used to be his dad.)

In the past 5 years or so, I think the game has been a lot less social. There has been a huge culture change.

- People used to chat a lot more during the games. 

Both toxic and non-toxic stuff. Less toxicity is nice, but I don't think the price we pay is worth it. You used to really feel you were playing with human beings and now often it feels like bots.

- People used to add each other after the game and ask to duo all the time.

Still happens sometimes, but maybe 10% of what it used to.

- Post-game chat has been killed entirely. No one uses it now that it is opt-in. It was basically removed from the game.

- Clubs were removed (I actually used it as one of the few)

- Ranked 5s were removed and Flex is a meme.

I guess to sum it all up: I made so many friends in League that I still talk to sometimes.

Insane to think about how far League has come. For all the doomers out there saying League is dying for whatever personal reason they think, pro League keeps smashing more and more viewership records. On top of that, it's not just because ""T1 is Riot's only hope"" anymore; more orgs have steadily built their own fanbase with lots of fans tuning in to watch their games.

T1 is still obviously the most popular team in the world, thus attracting the highest viewership numbers and holding the current record at just above 3.6m, but GENG is a very close second. I'd like to think that maybe we can start to slowly move away from the narrative ""T1 / Faker or doom"". League grows on its own, of course T1 helps a lot, but GENG is also bringing lots of numbers as well, as was evident but GENG vs FLY, but also LCK Summer finals or MSI finals for example.

1cl39zq,leagueoflegends,Professional Play DOES NOT UNDERSTAND Urgot - And here's why,"hi i'm back hiii i'm urpog i'm a grandmaster urgot for like 3 years now and urgot's been gaining popularity again because he's overpowered at the moment, several professional players have started playing or talking about urgot in general but have a very flawed perspective on what urgot actually is

369 played Urgot and didn't even bother toggling which is one of Urgot's core mechanics which show's he's picking Urgot due to his temporary strengths

Bwipo has always been an Urgot enjoyer and actually inhibits what it takes to be good at Urgot because he frequently talks to Urgot players to help foundation his opinion, Bwipo is easily the best Urgot, followed up by Kiin who is also an Urgot player at his core. I'm pointing out this to open your eye to the fact Urgot is an actual contender champion at the moment and why he's getting some priority around him; he's a bit broken atm and I'll extrapolate on that at the bottom of the post.

LS himself said Urgot hard counters rumble when the opposite is true: [https://twitter.com/LSXYZ9/status/1787032131320865056](https://twitter.com/LSXYZ9/status/1787032131320865056)

A caster called ""Emily Rand"" was casting a game and said Urgot is great against Rumble as Urgot is a lane bully; this isn't true.

Urgot isn't a lane bully nor does Urgot counter rumble, infact Rumble is one of Urgot's hardest counters. Urgot is a mid game god who also happens to have a strong level 1 and 2 which makes people mistake him for being a lane bully; Urgot CAN lane bully but you won't see people in professional play locking something like Garen or Singed into Urgot where Urgot can continue to press advantages, even when gold accelerated Urgot struggles because at his core he's a scaling champion who spikes in mid game and then is great late game.

https://preview.redd.it/89zkpj6anoyc1.png?width=1308&format=png&auto=webp&s=3676e5eba8b614a61c11da48ad4d41cddd77c69c

So, the reason people in professional play think Urgot is a certain way is because they're going off a 3 year old narrative which was the last time Urgot was prevalent and don't get me wrong, I don't blame them. Urgot literally hasn't surfaced so how would they know how he's changed? Urgot's identity is currently based around Fleet Footwork and it's the sole reason he's viable right now;

Urgot is currently overpowered due to how he interacts with fleet footwork as he has a unique animation with it where his w works towards energising, urgot's main issue is he has no sustain or mobility, fleet gives sustain and mobility so they nerfed his armor to hurt his reliability which was a good way of answering it, here's what it looks like vs what it should look like; [https://twitter.com/Urpog1/status/1782675593303134612](https://twitter.com/Urpog1/status/1782675593303134612) (i'd attach it here but they don't allow more than 1 attachment on reddit for some reason, gg.)

Urgot's core used to be PTA - TP or PTA - Ignite but why would you ever run PTA - Ignite when it has more risks and scales worse? Defensive play in League of legends is absolutely the way to play correctly at the moment (especially to my displeasurement) so Urgot's identity has shifted. He isn't a lane bully, he's a broken scaling champion with relatively no weaknesses outside of ranged ADC's and control mages. Urgot fairs very well into the current proplay environment of toplane because a lot of toplaners are defaulting to picking melee champions which is what Urgot generically thrives against.

Urgot's old identity was a lane bully as he used to max Q and run arcane comet and would demolish you in lane, they slapped heavy mana nerfs onto his Q so now you only ever max W, even if you want Q for additional poke you put 3 points into it then pivot into maxing W, especially because of how good toggling is for Urgot as a whole. This is why the caster and professional play analysis don't understand how Urgot has changed, they look at old data and his old identity purely because he's made a recent resurgence 

Here's a tierlist of what Urgot is good and bad against [https://twitter.com/Urpog1/status/1787235913098985946](https://twitter.com/Urpog1/status/1787235913098985946)

Again, I'd post it here but they don't let me add more than one attachment, sorry about that

Side note; I don't blame Emily or LS for being incorrect, in fact I like that they are incorrect because they're paying attention to my abomination of a champion who has been dusted for several years, the fact he's getting any attention is great and I'm happy it's happening, please don't throw any insults their way, I'm a LS shill anyway",3533,528,1714947811,Negative,0.469,neutral,0.882
1gyw9c8,leagueoflegends,NNO tournament admins are considering banning laneswaps. What do you guys think?,"From Caedrel's stream today, he mentioned that the tournament admins put it to a vote regarding whether lane swaps should be allowed. 

It ended up with four votes for allowing lane swaps and four votes against lane swaps. 

Three of the four teams that voted against lane swaps were teams annihilated by Caedrel's team in scrims, including Druttut/Jankos' team. 

Personally, I believe that while it can be boring and noninteractive for viewers, banning in-game tactics and strategies should never be considered. Even if it is a 'for fun' tournament, it is akin to fixing teams to a certain playstyle that is forced and formulaic. Lane swaps are a viable tactic that isn't a cheat/hack/bug, it is part of the game. Even if it means putting five mid or two junglers - teams should be able to do whatever it takes to win. It isn't the team's fault, it is on Riot to gut that strategy if it is unengaging for the enemy team and the viewers. Blame the game, not the player.

What do you think? Should lane swaps be banned to force standard lanes in the tourney for ""better"" viewer experience/debuffing macro-heavy teams (like Caedrel's) or should teams be allowed to play however they want?",3509,766,1732469053,Negative,0.602,neutral,0.402

I played league for 10 years straight. I started when I was 14. I played every single lane. I had an account for each lane (lol).  Ranked was what I loved. I was nearly masters later season. I was 2 games away from masters, and I cried to my boyfriend when I couldn’t get there. 

Since I have quit league (8.5 weeks) (EDIT: 4.5 WEEKS, NOT 8.5)  I have started a new internship, planted a garden, painted, wrote a short story, and finished the Elden ring DLC. I haven’t had acne for the past month (lol?). I wake up and go to sleep on time. I spend less money (I was always buying skins.. kind of sad). 

My life is just better. I used to care about my LP. I contributed it to my self worth. I don’t know why I did that. I think it had something to do with the amount of time I spent playing. If I spent 5 hours playing, I expected something out of it. But instead, I would find myself -50 lp and worse confidence than when I started. 

I know there are a lot of posts about this but.. I feel like a lot of people just glance over these thinking, yeah yeah. Whatever. 

But I promise you, life is increasingly better without this horrible piece of shit game ruining your confidence and life. Trust me. I spent 10 years putting 10+ hours a day into this game. My boyfriend can confirm this. Maybe I’ll make a video explaining as well, so no one else can suffer the horrible addiction that I had to this game.

Treat this game like smoking. It is an addiction. It is a fucking disease. They prey off your weak will. They laugh at your pain while also charging $500 a skin. They are LAUGHING at your misery. My dream was to be a pro. What a delusion!

The pools had interesting results. Some surprised me, some didn't.  
  
I personally thought MF would be the number 1, and I didn't expect Kai'Sa to be this high in the list. Alto, there are some facts that may have caused that, which I have explained in the document.  
  
I hope you all enjoy this insight as much as I did.  
  
So, did you expect these results? Your favorite champion deserve a better rank? What are your thoughts?",3461,1186,1722877824,Positive,0.501,surprise,0.737

I wanted to share this photo, as I feel like most people didn't see this one. BLG players look devastated with knight crying.

I feel like BLG should run back this roster next year. If you think about it, there journey is kind of similar to T1 2022 with the exception of winning Summer. They both placed 2nd in international tournaments and lost in game 5 of Worlds finals. Tbf meta was good for BLG, and they may never get a chance like this again but I feel like T1 and Faker were too clutched and experienced at that situation. It is worth for them to try again next year, and I don't see a better LPL team than this one being formed. I guess it all depends on LPL salary cap and if players want to run it back when they could potentially get higher salary on other teams.

Also shoutout to T1 fans as I've actually seen many of them showing respect to this roster, and wanting them to run it back despite being a rival. Many of you are being nice after being back to back winners. I guess even rivals dont want to see a region ""dying"" and losing competition.

1emnb6c,leagueoflegends,You really don't need a leash anymore. You definitely don't need to throw game over not getting one.,"""I can't leash.""

""I can't gank. gl.""

As a Jungler trying to transition to a Toplaner and practicing in norms, I've had two junglers recently throw an absolute fit because I wouldn't leash them, and I'm completely bewildered by the reaction. When I jungle (in mid-Plat) I prefer short or no leash and absolutely never expect one from the toplane since it's so insanely volatile and L1 wave interactions can be really important. I'd also prefer my botlane get better control of their lane than shave a couple seconds off my clear.

Jungle items (pets) are REALLY good nowadays and every jungler I'm aware of can full-clear at least decently without assistance. (Maybe some wildly off-meta picks need some help, but that hasn't been the case where my junglers tilted over this.)

Part of me is almost inclined to go and give them 2 autos just to reduce the risk of their tilting, but I'd really rather just play as correctly as I can without being punished over a bizarre perceived slight.

  
Edit: Couple clarifications after 2 hours:

 - Yes, laners should be watching for invades or otherwise being useful from 00:00. Not leashing is not an excuse to go AFK.

 - My frustrations are primarily from playing toplane, which has the most to lose from a leash (and tbf this is not clear from the title). However, if your laners decide that their lane prio is more important than your leash, they are likely more informed than you. There are two scuttles and three lanes a jg can work with, but losing early prio in a difficult match up can be devastating.",3421,754,1723064575,Negative,0.677,surprise,0.936
1fg1wqr,leagueoflegends,3 Ranked Splits is Too Much,"League of legends games are very long.  The process of queuing up, champ select, and finishing a game takes around 35-40min on average.  This combined with the fact that you only have the influence of 1 person on a 5 person team makes the ranked process very high-variance.  You can be decently better than your rank, and still only win about 55-60% of games.  Not to mention unlucky losing streaks that happen to everyone.  I’m not claiming that climbing is “impossible because of noob team” or anything like that, but it is statistically a fact that it may take a large amount of games to reach an accurate rank for your skill level.  

I miss having the entire year, or even half the year to play ranked before the split ended.  The current 3 split system feels really bad for those of us with jobs/busy lives/other hobbies.  4 months feels way too short to make meaningful ranked progress, especially since you get reset an entire tier with each new split.  It feels like I’m spending 90% of the split crawling through low diamond, and once I get back to my previous rank I’m so mentally exhausted I don’t even want to play the last 2 weeks I have remaining.",3410,628,1726252293,Neutral,0.5,neutral,0.647

1hm1f3c,leagueoflegends,"Kraken Slayer needs a new name, since it doesn't do what made it a kraken slayer","The name fit the theme of the item back when it was a tank-buster, because on release it dealt true damage. Ignoring armor meant it could melt tanks (duh). 

But it isn't for tanks any more. Not really.

Even the [patch notes](https://www.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/news/game-updates/patch-13-10-notes/) for the removal of true damage, their words were:

>Its damage ramping up against a target helps it retain a bit of that anti-tank flavor, **but make no mistake**: it’s no replacement for Lord Dominik’s Regards for tank-busting.

*But*, that was when they changed it from True to Magic. Which meant it did in fact retain some of its tankbusting, because it's harder to itemize against mixed damage. 

The very next patch, they changed it to physical, and had this to say:

>Crit marksmen are dealing too much magic damage in long engagements, so we're switching Kraken Slayer to deal physical damage instead of magic.

So it went from having ""a bit"" of its anti-tank strength, to none of it at all. 

# and then

With this season, it had its crit removed and later its on-hit reduced. Twice for ranged champs. Pushing it from already no longer being anti-tank, to being actively bad into tanks. 

And yet the recommended build system still lists it as good against tanks (though the recommended system told me Vlad had no sustain the other day, so that's not much of a metric). More important is people, even in higher levels of play, are still buying it *as if* it's anti-tank when it's not.

It doesn't scale the amount of missing HP. It has a flat *self* multiplier based on missing HP. 

Sounds similar, but different meaning. It's the difference between Riven's and Jinx's ults. If they both ult a dummy with 10,000 max HP and 2500 left , a 350 bAD Riven won't kill since at most her ult will go from 410 to 1230 damage. Jinx will kill it, even point-blank, with 0 AD, since she'll deal 2625 from the missing HP scaling alone. 

Anyway, Kraken just isn't an anti-tank item any more, and hasn't been for over a year. It shouldn't be called Kraken Slayer any more. ",3377,279,1735135970,Negative,0.475,neutral,0.867

Oner recently opened a youtube channel and had a Q&A for his first video. I don't see any subtitles yet so.... :V



**Recommended Restaurants in Gwangju**

* Think all the food in Gwangju is consistently above average. He just goes anywhere.

* But likes Gamja-tang (pork bone soup)andalways make sure to eat it at least once 

**Cooking Skills** 

* Is interested in cooking but does not cook much. Wants to try to improve



**Oner’s Meal Recommendation**

* Not good at deciding on meals, but would pick dishes that everyone would likely enjoy since he does not follow a diet  

**Oner’s Diet Update**

* Has not been following any specific diet. 
* Stopped exercising and have been taking a break for about a year and a half now. 
* Currently eats whatever. So because of that, feels like he’s gotten weaker
*  Next season plans to work hard and resume exercising seriously.



**Max Lifts in Weightlifting**

* Doesn’t know exact max lifts because he haven’t been doing them. 
* Back wasn’t in best condition so he did not do deadlifts
* Worked the most on his back and shoulders 
* Feels that squats are boring and exhausting so he doesn’t have the best memories
* Been doing back and shoulder exercises since high school, so he fomds those a bit easier to handle and more enjoyable compared to other lifts.



**The Content I Most Want to Create**

* Would like to have all his teammates come together for something. 
* If everyone’s schedules align, he’d love to show something involving all five of them doing something together.
* If that’s not possible he thinks that creating content around trying out different sports could be fun. 

**""I Just Said I Don’t Know Because I Don’t Know""**

* “It’s not some concept or anything. If there’s something I can answer, I’ll absolutely answer it. But when something feels like a 50-50 or a gray area, or if I genuinely don’t know, I simply respond that I don’t know. However, suddenly people started interpreting my answers differently, which feels a bit unfair. It’s just that some questions were things I couldn’t answer, so I honestly said I didn’t know. That’s all there is to it.”



**Oner's YouTube Algorithm**

* Often get recommendations related to League of Legends
* Also from both the YouTube channel of baseball player Lee Dae-ho and Shortbox. 
* Also like sto watch movie trailers



**Re-challenging Winning Voice?**

* If he gets another chance to film it, he would do it again.
* Felt like he wasn’t well-prepared last time so he would like to show better skills



**Songs to Listen to While Driving**

* Just lets autoplay do its thing, or he plays some hip-hop to keep things from feeling too dull when driving alone.



**Favorite Karaoke Song**

* Has been singing songs like ""Blue Whale"" by Yoon Do Hyun Band. So he tends to enjoy old ballads or rock ballads at karaoke. 

**Oner’s Bucket List**

* Has been playing a lot of screen baseball recently, so he thinks it would be fun to gather his friends and make a casual tournament.
* Otherwise he hasn’t thought about many things yet so he plans to take some time to think about it when resting. 

**Baseball Stadium Experience**  
  


* Been to baseball stadiums to watch games in person probably over 20 times since he was young. When he was young went with his family but now mostly goes with his friends



**Connection with Eui-ri Lee Baseball Player**

* Got introduced to him through a friend while working together
* Because they both live in Gwangju would end up meeting quite often. 
* Supported each other, hung out, and naturally became close.



**Interest in Growing Long Hair?**

* Became a bit interested and thought about it for a while, but decided that long hair doesn’t suit him.
* Has no intention of growing long hair at all. If he were to experiment, it would be with something like a perm or trying a new hair color instead.

**What’s in My Bag**

* Doesn’t carry a bag on a regular basis. 
* When he goes to tournaments, he would pack things like his keyboard, mouse, and other personal items. 
* For Worlds he would pack clothes and some essentials like vitamins. Nothing special because the managers would take care of them.

**Recent Fashion Style**

* During the season would just wear something simple, like a white tracksuit or a short-sleeve T-shirt, to work.
*  But during breaks or vacation, wants to dress up a bit more to give off the impression of being someone who knows how to dress well. 

**Favorite Brand**

* Nike and Goalstudio  

**Cat Hoodie**

* Didn’t like cats before but the hoodie was a gift from a fan
* Started to wear it more because he's been seeing stray cats more. Often getting a lot of cute moments with them, making him like cats more

**Pet I Want to Raise**

* Hasn’t owned a pet before but if he would it would be a cat
* But he has allergies so hasn’t considered it

**Do You Like Cars?**

* Is not super passionate about cars, but does enjoy driving and looking at them.
* Dream car has always been a Porsche Panamera

**Are You Single?**

* Yes, I think I’m at an age where my heart is ready to beat for someone.

**Caterpillar Signature Story**

* “Caterpillar signature? To be honest, I didn’t think it looked like a bug, but when people started calling it that, I was a bit taken aback. When I write ""Oner"" quickly, it ends up looking like that. I also added some facial expressions to it. Since some people might not recognize it as my signature, I started writing ""Oner"" smaller underneath it. Over time, it has developed and improved bit by bit. Now, I think fewer people see it as looking like a bug.”



**Volunteering**

* Got into volunteering when he was in highschool, picked a club and found out later it was a well known volunteering organization
* Thought initially it would be a place to hang out and have fun but as he started to participate in volunteer activities he found it was fulfilling and enjoyable. 
* “As I kept doing it, I realized volunteering is one of those things that can be fun and meaningful. Helping others brought me great joy, so I ended up doing it quite often during high school.” 
* “What stands out the most is when I participated in overseas volunteering. That experience remains the most memorable for me. I went to Laos, and I felt the children there were genuinely grateful that we came.” 
* “Because of that, I was even more motivated to work hard. I worked diligently, painting and even performing Taekwondo in front of the kids. It was truly a joyful and unforgettable experience.”


**If Oner Wasn’t a Pro Gamer**

* Would have tried to become an athlete in something like baseball or soccer
* Believed that he could have pursued being a player in those fields.
* Otherwise would have chosen a major related to sports. But he wasn’t very good at academics

**Conversations with T1 Players**

* “We don’t really hang out among ourselves very often. There were a few occasions when we went to Sanghyuk-hyung’s (Faker’s) house to hang out. When we did, we usually watched movies together or went to the sauna. That’s how we typically spent time together. It’s not like we do many active or outgoing things together.”


**Teammate I Want to Travel With**

* “If I had to travel with someone, it would have to be Lee Min-young (Gumayusi). He might not be the best planner, but he does make an effort to come up with decent plans. I think having him with me would make the trip more comfortable.”

**KakaoTalk Group Chat with Teammates**

* “There’s a KakaoTalk group chat where everyone is included. It’s mostly used for managers to post announcements, so it’s not very active otherwise. I don’t think we’ve made a group chat just among ourselves. It’s more of a general group chat where everyone, including staff, is present.”

**Least Obedient Teammate**

* The least obedient teammate? I think fans might already know—Sanghyuk-hyung (Faker) is probably the one who’s late the most often. But honestly, I feel like most of us don’t listen all that well. I think I’m the one who listens the best. Yes, I’d say I’m the most obedient one.


**First Impressions of Teammates**

* Do I remember my first impressions? Of course. Sanghyuk-hyung (Faker) felt like a ""friendly neighborhood fool."" You know, pro gamers don’t usually put much effort into dressing up, and since the team house is right nearby, he’d just grab some clothes lying around and head out without showering. So, when I first met him, I was like Huh? That’s Faker? That’s the kind of impression I got.
* As for Gumayusi, when I first joined the academy, he was already on the main team. He had this slight ""cool guy"" aura going on. At first, I thought, ""Ah, this guy seems like someone who likes to show off a bit."" That was the impression I had back then.
* Keria, on the other hand, seemed to stay the same. My first impression of him was that he seemed like someone who enjoys having fun and is quite active. That was the vibe I got from him.

**T1 Members Ranking: 1st and Last**

* If I had to rank them, I think Sanghyuk-hyung (Faker) would be 1st because he’s been here the longest. As for last place, I think it would probably be Gumayusi. Why? 
*  Well, I think the viewers already know the reason, so I don’t really need to explain it. 

**Reasons for Renewing Contract**

* I think my goal is to continue playing as part of a single team. Personally, I believe that staying with one team will help me maintain and grow the fanbase of people who support and like me. Also, playing games here is something I genuinely enjoy. That’s why I decided to stay here again. It wasn’t a decision based on deep considerations; I simply had a strong desire to continue playing here. That’s the main reason why I decided to renew my contract.

**Conversations with Teammates During Contract Renewal**

* Since it’s a sensitive topic, we didn’t really ask each other directly, like, ""Did you renew your contract?"" Everyone just made their own decisions individually without much discussion. We joked around instead, saying things like, ""See you on the other side next year"" or something along those lines. It wasn’t anything warm like, ""Let’s stick together next year, okay?"" It was more like jokingly saying, ""Let’s just make it to next year alive,"" with that kind of playful vibe. That’s how the conversations about it went.


**What T1 Means to Oner**

* Since T1 is the team I’ve been with from the start, it feels like my ""first home."" They provide everything, including food and support, so it really feels like my first home. It’s a place where I can enjoy myself and pursue my career as a pro gamer. In that sense, I’m very satisfied with being here.


**Reasons for Partnering with Agency KPA**

* KPA is an agency that handles advertising and sponsorships. 
* As an esports player noticed that many people were curious about things like how they interact with fans outside of matches or what they do during our free time. 
* So thought he could show those aspects through platforms like YouTube. 
* It felt like an exciting opportunity to try something different, something that feels fresh

1gqyzjy,leagueoflegends,It's upsetting to see Smolder and Aurora getting reworks in the same year they were released while other champions that could use minor (or even major) adjustments are ignored,"Seriously, I get it, they're launched at a bad state and need adjustments, but when they have literal functions of their kits changed to the point of being actually called reworks, I have wonder A) how the hell did they think their original state was acceptable in the first place (especially for the more recent Aurora) and B) why are these champions getting adjustments and older champions are not.

The latter part especially gets to me, because we can see that changes like those done to Ahri and Jax can breathe new life into those champions. I won't pretend to be biased here, Morgana is a champion I like very much, but sweet mother of Christ, has she been left to rot for a long time. The only times Morgana shines are when Riot decides they want to allow her to jungle and she becomes overpowered and gets nerfed again. 

Besides that, they never address the core issues of her kit, that trash passive, the Ultimate that has no business being on a champion that gets blown up for daring to go to the middle of a teamfight because the aforementioned trash passive does NOT help her survive, not enough damage to be mid, not enough utility/survivability to be a support, she is literally a worse version of Neeko.

I'm also gonna bring Sona into this, because she's also a character that is just not allowed to be good. She works as a mediocre heal bot and if the meta dares to allow her to be good, she skyrockets to massive winrates and gets nerfed immediatly. Why not change something about her? Sona used to be a champion able to dominate lane with her pokes, but with her mediocre damage she can't do that anymore, and her mediocre protection doesn't help with sustain in the laning phase that much. 

Why not take a page from her mobile kit? Her passive has a mini-stun in that game and while I know that having a TF gold card that easily could be cheap, as a support, I think she should be offering some more utility than a one-person damage reduction or a one-person slow. Her Ultimate in that game is also more interesting, as it's basically a Viktor Ultimate with a one time stun and consistent slow, which gives her some zoning power, her current Ultimate is a basic AoE stun that is worse than most other CC Ults in the game.

I appreciate the attempts to keep new champions in check, but when Aurora is getting changed to be accessible to more players so shortly after her release, I think it's reasonable to ask that older champions get changed to be usable by players and hell, maybe even to get tried in pro play if they have a niche, Morgana was a wasted opportunity when she got an ASU alongside Kayle's VGU, give the older champions some love.

**EDIT:** So, I see a lot of people bringing up win rates and pick rates and I think you guys are missing the point. I think Ahri is the best example of this, she never had particularly bad win/pick rates, but her kit felt outdated as her passive and Ultimate were underwhelming, as such, she got a rework that made those more consistent and became an overall better champion. Jax is also an example of this, though I won't go into detail with him because I don't play him nearly as much as Ahri, Morgana or Sona. Also, a lot of people mentioned Quinn in the comments, but she was in one of the VGU polls, so at least we know Riot is aware of her problems (I hope).",3263,799,1731566814,Negative,0.892,surprise,0.815

1da74tn,leagueoflegends,Foxdrop (and other Riot broadcast talent) weighs in on the working relationship with Riot - talking about how they get ghosted and eventually finding out on Twitter that they do not have a job anymore.,"Foxdrop - a former LEC broadcast talent (and also EUM/NLC and other things) talked about his working relationship on Twitter. It was interesting and a lot of people replied so we get an insight into how Riot works with broadcast talent.

[Foxdrop replying to Spica's announcement](https://x.com/Foxdroplol/status/1798462956537319451) saying he found out he was kicked on Twitter: 

>This is how I found out I was dropped from LEC too, must be a League of Legends thing 🤔 


[Foxdrop continues](https://x.com/Foxdroplol/status/1798693483781476695):

>I was ghosted for 5 MONTHS just to find out on Twitter I was dropped by LEC. 

>Fortunately casting was a passion thing for me and not my job so I was ok career wise. But this kind of thing has happened to MULTIPLE people, most of whom relied on casting as their livelihood

>Some even uprooted their lives, moved to Berlin, worked a split or two, then got ghosted and dropped. Now they're in a foreign country wondering wtf they're meant to do next.

>It's the not knowing. You can't look for a new gig because you're still holding out hope for LEC

>After all, why shouldn't you? Last you heard everything was gucci. Then the months pass, the announcements get posted, the talent schedule gets released and you see you aren't there, and those in charge have stopped replying to your messages

>It's the big downside of being a contractor. You're paid for each weekend you work and that's it. You will be told you have job security, of course, and you absolutely do - until papa Riot decides you don't

>As much as working the LEC is a prestigious honour and a great experience this is the sad reality of being talent there. Esports is competitive and cut throat but bruh. You can't ghost people when you hold their literal livelihoods in your hands. It's simply unacceptable

>Sorry for the long rant. It was frustrating enough when it happened to me but it was a long time ago and I had things to fall back on. But I'm STILL hearing about this kind of thing happening and it's not on. I just want Riot to approach these decision with more humanity.

[MonteCristo responds](https://x.com/MonteCristo/status/1798858597683843230):

>I was announced as a caster for Worlds one year without being told and with no contract offer. I was then told I should work an entire Worlds for exposure and they tried to lie to me that my contract with OGN, and entirely different company than Riot, should include Worlds.



[RyanCentral responds to Foxdrop](https://x.com/RyanCentral/status/1798766630417338475):

>For those that ask me 'why I'm not doing EMEA anymore' this is exactly what happened to me too.

>'You can't ghost people when you hold their literal livelihoods in your hands. It's simply unacceptable' is incredibly true though. It was disappointing to be treated so badly

Foxdrop also tweeted [this](https://x.com/Foxdroplol/status/1798765860175352028):

>Having a lot of people, even from other Riot titles, also message me about their experience with this. One was a main stay for almost half a decade and STILL got this treatment. Insane

We have Red Canids Brance fighting T1, which is obviously a last minute script change where they decided to have Pain fill in for Brazil at the event, but it's close enough. 

Now here's the interesting part. To get in to fight T1, we have two players duking it out on top of the gate. GenG Chovy, T1's eternal rival that has already fought T1 a million times and thus can easily be inserted into the video as a sort of lead up to Worlds narrative, and FlyQuest Massu. 

But FlyQuest hasn't faced T1 yet, and to do so FlyQuest has to face GenG, just like in the video. So obviously FlyQuest wins today so they can make Linkin Park proud and fight T1 in Semis. NAmen.",3233,117,1729415464,Neutral,0.675,neutral,0.881

But the onetricks apparently hate it too? All I read was that their mastery points are now invisible to anybody but yourself and that 1.000.000 Mastery got replaced by a crisp 90, which they are absolutely not happy with.

As I understand it mastery points are invisible/gone, got replaced by a much slower tracker which otherwise functions  virtually the same. And the old way to get M7 through S-games had to completely die for this. So everybody looses? Except one-trick loot goblins who now get slightly more stuff by playing only one character?

A girl from work (I must say, shes a 9/10 and more attractive than my gf) was hitting on me. One day she texted me to come to my place and have wine, we already knew where this was going and what was going to happen that night, so I said to her to just let me clean up the space and get back to her. I cleaned up the place, and said to myself that I deserved to play some LoL while I waited for my coworker. I played 7 games in a row, and completely forgot about my coworker. Later that night my gf came to my place, telling me that we should be together and that we were dumb thinking about splitting up. So yeah, if it wasn't for LoL I wouldn't have a gf now .
Happy new year from a toxic singed main

>I promised you guys we will win today so i'm sorry for being unable to fulfill the promise. I also wanted to show you more of myself playing in more matches this year, but it didn’t work out that way, which is really disappointing. Throughout the year, I was able to enjoy the games a lot thanks to the cheers from the fans... I’m grateful for those experiences. I don't think I might be able to greet you guys for quite a while, so stay healthy and be happy, till we meet again. Thank you guys.

Some questions and answers from the press conference mentioned above.

**Q: As your journey as a pro player comes to an end, how do you feel?**

* 'Deft': I started simply because I loved playing games, but along the way, I imagined what my ideal version of a professional player would look like, and I worked really hard to become that. In that sense, I feel proud of myself for that effort.

**Q: Do you have any plans after military service?**

* 'Deft': Honestly, it's still a long way off, so I’m not sure how things will turn out. But ending everything with today’s loss feels too disappointing, so I think I might challenge myself again after completing my military service.

**Q: Any final words?**

* 'Deft':I was asked the same question yesterday, and I wanted to talk today with a happy heart after winning. I’m really thankful for the long-time support you’ve given us. Although the result was disappointing, I won’t be here next year, but my teammates will continue on. I hope that, together with the coaches, today’s result will help them achieve even better outcomes moving forward. Thank you so much to all the fans for supporting us throughout the year.",3000,78,1726411549,Positive,0.983,joy,0.914

>Hello, first,I would like to apologize to the fans. I'm sorry.  
I will be honest.  
Fnatic is just helping me now.  
The day after the series against Weibo ended,I talked to Fnatic I want to leave the team.  
Because after this year ended, I thought that five of us shouldn't stay together and if someone should get replaced,it should be me.  
We failed repeatedly at every important moment this year and the main reason was me. I had guilty about it.  
And at some point I lost myself   
And I started to doubt whether I was worthy of that opportunity.  
 it was comfortable and really fun to spend time with our members,but I felt like I was getting used to the comfort and my improve was getting slow.  
I thought if I want to improve as a player, I need a new challenge and a new environment.  
Because our fnatic members are so good,so I want to step out of their shadow and prove myself.  
And I will try to find myself and being myself.  
Fnatic understood and accepted my opinion and did their best to help me.  
So I'm really grateful that they gave me the opportunity.  
But I'm really sorry to the fans. I wanted to bring you a trophy and make you proud, but I think I'll have to leave like this.  
But the fans have been a great source of strength to me and will continue to be so in the future. Thank you so much [#alwaysfnatic](https://x.com/hashtag/alwaysfnatic?src=hashtag_click)",2976,246,1729554527,Negative,0.48,sadness,0.891

While FLY is doing the Baron, Peyz calls that he is going to push mid lane. A second afterwards, Kiin calls out that GENG has no vision on Baron, but not necessarily in a ""they are doing Baron"" way, but more so in a ""we need to have vision at Baron"" way. A couple seconds after, Peyz throws out his ult to the baron pit, just to get slight vision, but once again, he did so without any real fear that FLY is already on the Baron.

With the vision provided by Ziggs' R, GENG is trying to react, Canyon says that ""they've got it"", but Kiin is trying to contest, Chovy is asking for a control ward to TP by Kiin and then we know what happens next.

Quite nice to know how this went down. There was so much speculation regarding vision plants, missing players and what have you. Turns out, it was just an honest whoopsie by GENG not having the pit warded, Kiin pointing it out, Peyz investing his R to get temporary vision and then GENG collapsing.",2928,188,1729928670,Neutral,0.648,neutral,0.881

1gvm3kk,leagueoflegends," Faker""I had only thought of failure as a neg thing but as I play, esp since 2-3 years ago, I learned a lot. That although the very idea of failure seems really negative overall, if you think about it, I can grow through failure and help me do better. In fact, I feel like I'm currently in my prime"" ","WARNING LOTS OF WORDS:

Faker gave a speech at the 2024 Future Dialogue for Global Innovation.

[https://www.youtube.com/live/6ho4dQb\_hGQ?si=NO-SgnbIWOsXQZxj](https://www.youtube.com/live/6ho4dQb_hGQ?si=NO-SgnbIWOsXQZxj)

English subtitles here, but I added some bits. I also bolded the more interesting parts.

Good morning ladies and gentlemen. I am pro-gamer, Faker, Lee Sang-hyeok. I am very honored to give the keynote speech. Pleasure to see you. I am extremely nervous, and I think it's the first time speaking in front of a huge public like this. As a pro gamer, 3 weeks ago I played in front of so many people, tens of thousands of people, and yet again, giving a speech in front of such an audience, I think it's one of the most nerve-wracking moments of my life. So, I am extremely happy and excited to be here, and I never imagined that I would be standing in front of you as a pro gamer. I think I was quite lucky in many ways. That is because while playing games and the job of a pro gamer was nonexistent 20 years ago. So, there was not even a job called pro gamer back in the days, but yet I came to pursue this journey as a pro gamer, and now I am standing in front of you giving a speech. I feel all the more grateful and excited.

**I had prepared a keynote speech for today, but while listening to the previous speakers, I thought that reading off my script, I don't know if I could sincerely share the messages I want to convey. So, I just want to improvise my speech, just base it off my few keywords. But I will do my best.** While preparing for today's keynote speech, the word ""keynote speech"" was not familiar to me, so I looked up its definition, and I found it to be interesting. The dictionary said that a keynote speech is typically delivered by an important figure to outline key principles, policies, and directions at events like parliamentary or academic conferences. But here, we are not at the parliament, not at the national convention, nor an academic conference. So, I think that maybe the keynote speech I am going to deliver will not really fit that definition. So, I'm just going to share with you my personal experience, my personal story to the young people present today. And I hope that my simple story will offer everybody here a little bit of empathy and inspiration and some key take-away messages that you can ponder upon when you go back home. So, it is with that simple hope I want to begin my story.

I was born in 1996, and even when I was born, I was quite familiar with digital devices. Meaning that I think I was probably 4 or 5 years old when I began to play games. There were the pack-type games that you would insert to play. I felt really happy that I found the right thing, the thing that I wanted to do, and I found great joy in playing games. I thought to myself that I want to continue to do that. So, it was like a pack-inserting type of game, but then there was a new era of playing computer games. It was probably around when I was 8 that I began to play computer games.

Back in the days, the computer monitor displays would have a back, and it was not flat. So, our generation experienced digital very closely in our daily lives. I began playing games since then. **The reason I became a pro gamer was first, when I was 18, I dropped out of school and decided to give everything in me to become a pro gamer. When I was a student, I was not a very good student, I didn't really excel in academics, and I used to just play games every time I returned home from school. Yes, that was me.** Again, thank you for giving me this opportunity to give this speech. So, that's how I began my job as a pro gamer.

**When I first began pursuing this journey, I really didn't think that I would be successful in this journey. I just wanted to take a chance because I thought that it would be a very unique experience. Of course, if you become successful, it is a very good thing, but I thought that the experience in and of itself would be very special to me. I really wanted to pursue that, and maybe in 1 year or the next 2 years, I would go for other things. I had that kind of sense of challenge, and a challenging spirit.**

**I have been working as a pro gamer for the last 12 years. I never imagined that I would do this for a long time. I think that sense of challenging spirit made me who I am today. One of the messages that I want to share with you today is about a sense of challenge and also failure.** I debuted in 2013 & won Worlds in ‘13, ‘15, & ‘16, I won the world championship, also referred to as the LoL Cup. In League of Legends, this championship is like the World Cup for soccer.

**So I won 3 times and I thought that I must be destined to be a pro gamer, it’s a good thing I became one, & that I’ll only keep winning in the future. I had a lot of confidence & thought I could excel in everything since I’m the best. I had that sort of expectation, but the next time I won Worlds after 2016 was in 2023. In a span of 7-8 years, I went through a lot of failures. Of course not only failures, but I learned a lot of things during the process. I realized I can’t always succeed.**

**As I kept failing, I learned something from that. Failure isn’t always a bad thing. I’m very competitive, so in the beginning when I lost games, I got very angry. After losing a match, I didn’t punch & break equipment in the dorms, but I did punch something I punched the sofa. Since my hand would hurt, I hit the squishy sofa because I was frustrated after losing. I had that much competitiveness, but as I kept experiencing defeats, I realized that sort of competitiveness won’t always lead me to victory. From then on, I did a lot of soul searching & wondered how I could shave off the edges of this competitiveness to further develop myself.**

I continued to ponder on how to grow further, building on these defeats. Working as a pro gamer, a lot of people found me to be a very quiet person. I had a hard time speaking in front of the public, especially in front of a large crowd, and also with my team members. I wouldn't really talk and chat much, but working as a pro gamer, I became more communicative. I learned about the importance of communication, and mostly, it was a time for me to know about myself more.

**The biggest lesson I learned as a pro is the importance of failure. In the world of pro-gaming, you must always win and come out on top over others, so of course, I thought winning was a good thing while losing was a bad thing. I had only thought of failure as a negative thing, but as I play—especially starting around 2-3 years ago, I learned a lot that although the very idea of failure seems really negative overall, if you think about it, I can grow through that failure and help me do better.**

**In fact, I feel like I'm currently in my prime and this '23-'24 too—I was was able to win this year (at Worlds) three weeks ago. And I think at the foundation of that success—if I had thought of failing as mere failures, I wouldn't have been able to achieve that. So I think right now, all those failures together have made me who I am today. Rather than mere failures, I've come to think of failures as small victories. There's a saying, ""Failure is the mother of success,"" but more than that, I think failure is a part of success.**

**So even if I lose a match, I can think, ""Ah, this is also a small victory."" I think this is the biggest lesson I've learned and it's actually become a huge source of motivation for me. Rather than thinking, ""I shouldn't lose,"" or ""I must win,"" I can just enjoy the game and just like in this moment, regardless of whether I've failed or succeeded at delivering this speech without preparing a script for it, I can think of this as a small victory and I've learned a lot about how to adopt a mindset that enjoys taking on a challenge. I hope that all of the young people would have that kind of spirit because it's my passion and my enthusiasm that have driven me to who I am today. The passion comes out from the joy of what you do and being fearless. This is the message I really wanted to share with you.**

**In the beginning, I was afraid of failure even though it wasn't really seen by others, but now I try to enjoy every moment of the process.** A pro gamer's career is very short. I've maintained mine for 12 years. I'm the odd one out and on average it's around 6-7 years. But I think it was possible because I had no fears. One of the other things I learned is that **learning and growing are 2 important values in my life.**

Being a pro gamer, you always crave winning, victory. Sometimes you win, and sometimes you lose, but if I have this strong craving to win, the goal is achieved not just by myself but when it comes to winning something. It is also due to other external factors as well—who the opponent is, what environment he/she has faced in. **I didn't really like the fact that my success, that my things, would be defined by others and other external factors. So, I always believed that there should be these values that I should uphold. If today is better than yesterday, that is good enough.**

**All of these motivations within me propelled me to go forward. It's also in line with what I told you before. One of the important qualities that we should have is humility. A sense of humility is not to look down on yourself or belittle yourself, but I think that being humble means that you should know about who you are, your weaknesses compared to others. Everybody has their weaknesses, so you can look at others and have this feeling of wanting to improve your weaknesses by looking at others and learning from others.**

**Nowadays, we see a lot of hate in this world, and that is very unfortunate because everybody has their values. All of these values are not always right. You cannot be 100% sure that your values are always right and the others are wrong. You have to accept and embrace the fact that your values might be wrong. These days we see a lot of conflicts and hate in this world, and while looking at that, I think to myself that what we have and the values that we uphold are not always right. I think that there are many people out there that think the other way. I think that humility is a key word that is required in the world we live in.**

I think that I am running out of time. As I said, it is my first time, so I am just speaking whatever comes to mind. What I would like to emphasize is that I want you as young people to enjoy and do what you want to do and what you enjoy because life is short. In Korea, youth is defined as people from 19 to 34 years old. The U.S. definition is shorter, but anyways, you know we have a very short life, and especially a short youth life. I hope that you will be fearless, have respect for others, and do things that you like to do.

I don't think I was very logical in my keynote, but thank you for listening. I hope that you will have a very fruitful decision today. Thank you very much.",2918,146,1732096783,Positive,0.492,neutral,0.646

**On the 2024 season**

""I still feel regret starting with the Summer Finals. We had a chance to win, but we couldn’t seize that opportunity, and I feel the same about Worlds. There wasn’t much to regret, to be honest""

**On losing at Worlds**

""The pain of the losing has long passed. If we had gotten second place, I think it would have lasted longer. But I think we lost because we weren’t good enough, so it didn’t linger for long. Ultimately, I think we didn’t create the reason to win Worlds, and that’s why we fell short,""

**Faker in the finals**

""Watching the final, I thought Faker played incredibly well. I thought, ‘This is how you turn a losing game around and win.’ Especially when he solo-killed Sylas with Ziggs, I thought, ‘If they win this game, it’s going to start from that moment,’ and they actually won. It made me think about a lot of things.""

**On signing a 3 year contract**

""I used to think that one-year contracts were better for players because they allow you to prove yourself every year. However, recently, multi-year contracts have become the norm, and even if you prove yourself, your value doesn’t rise as much as it used to. That’s why I chose a multi-year contract. Also, there’s no team I trust or feel as supported by as Gen.G, which made the decision easier.""

**On Ruler**

""I was glad to see him again after a long time, and I was also happy because he’s such a great player.""

**On Duro**

""From a outsider’s perspective this year, I could tell that BNK FearX made a lot of strategic changes after switching their jungle and support roles. So I thought he was a player with potential.""

**On rumors about him moving to the LPL**

""Changing environments can make sense in some situations, but when I compare my current environment with what it would be like in China and calculate the chances of success, I don’t think they’d be very high.""

**On growing since his debut**

""I’ve continued to grow, but since it’s a game played by people, I think my psychological aspects, especially, have developed more than before. My perspective on the game, calmness, and experience continue to accumulate, and these factors help me produce good results.""

**On if he still has fiery spirit \[drive\]  like Kiin (who mentioned that he had to rely on this spirit to continue his career after his first championship)**

""Before I won my first LCK championship, I definitely had a lot of that fighting spirit. But after my first championship, if I still had that same spirit, I don’t think I would have lasted long. That fighting spirit helped me win, but because it’s fighting spirit, I think it’s something that can harm you in the long run.""

""After my first championship, I looked for other elements that would help me continue my career longer, and that’s the desire to prove myself. Showing a better performance in future games than in past ones is a big driving force behind my ability to play longer and better.""

""Of course, I want to achieve good results. If I have personal goals, it’s to show even better performance in terms of skill and to always be a better person. Besides physical self-care, since I spend a lot of time alone, I’ve been reflecting on myself and having conversations with myself, and I think I’m slowly becoming a better person.""

**Thanking the fans**

 ""I’m thankful to all the fans who have supported me for a long time and to those who have just started supporting me. I know there will be moments of joy and frustration, but I hope you’ll stay with us until the end.""",2909,186,1734371590,Neutral,0.484,sadness,0.596

I remember 1 year we didn't take a single turret in all of worlds I think.  


Are we stomping now? No. But the games genuinely look competitive.  We're contesting things.  We're drafting slightly more intelligently (still bad, we can't play yone or aurora), and we just look alive.  


Now if we could just figure out how to side lane and not ARAM for 20 minutes late game i think we've won.

This is what you asked for, HEAVY IS THE CROWN!⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

* **Zeus**, the **Top** who weathered the storm, is picking between **Gragas**, **Camille**, or **Ornn**
* **Oner**, the one true, decisive **Jungler** and finder of impossible picks, is either choosing **Vi** or **Xin Zhao**
* **Faker**, the decade-long unkillable demon king **Mid**, said, **""What fans might like!""** (Please be Galio or Sylas. The Demacian Petricite Wielders long for their 1st Worlds skin.)
* **Gumayusi**, god-like gladiator in the **Bot** lane, is going select either **Jhin** or **Varus**
* **Keria**, the capitalizing playmaker **Support** (and still waiting on that Lux skin), is deciding between his iconic picks this worlds, **Renata Glasc** or **Pyke**.

Congratulations for these world champions! Reminder that **Faker**, being the MVP of the Finals series, gets a **prestige skin** (and unofficially also a TFT Chibi as a pattern of the last two Worlds...wait a minute, T1 Orianna got a TFT chibi...uhhh, well maybe it'll go to one of the other players :P).

Very excited to see the aesthetics on this version of the T1 skins since this is the same roster as last year! Will they go back to the classic red scheme, or try something new? What do you think?

Read below:

""Riot Games canceled work on a prototype platform fighter code-named Pool Party in late May, according to current and former Riot Games employees familiar with the decision. Approximately 70-80 employees were working on the game when it was shuttered.

Sources familiar with the project described the original pitch for Pool Party as a platform fighter in the vein of Super Smash Bros. Melee set in the League of Legends universe. Riot Games saw an opportunity to build and support the game’s esports scene — unlike Nintendo, which is notoriously hands-off and even hostile toward the Smash competitive ecosystem.

“We always have a number of projects in various phases of R&D, and spinning projects up and down happens multiple times a year,” said Joe Hixson, senior comms director at Riot Games, in a statement.

A source familiar with staffing decisions at Riot said that approximately half of the team had received an offer to be reassigned within the studio, while others were in the process of seeking new positions through the company’s internal job board.

10 people had not received an offer and were not in the process of applying internally, the source said. Presumably, those workers were either laid off or had left the company.

Pool Party’s cancelation was precipitated in part by a reassessment of consumer appetite for a Smash competitor. According to sources familiar with the project’s development, executives at Riot were spooked by what they perceived as the failure of MultiVersus, a free-to-play fighting game starring characters from franchises owned by Warner Bros.

Originally envisioned as a hardcore fighting game, the pitch for Pool Party changed over the course of development, shifting to include party game elements and casual-friendly mechanics. The change in scope and vision frustrated some staff on the project.

Pool Party bears no relation to the other fighting game under development at Riot Games, the 2v2 team-based fighter 2XKO. The developer is still working on the latter title, which is slated to release in 2025.

The video game industry has seen a swell of layoffs, studio closures, and project cancelations and delays in 2024. Though it is impossible to track every layoff in the industry, some counts suggest that by June the number of layoffs in 2024 had already surpassed the total number of layoffs 2023. These estimates are almost certainly conservative.

Coincidentally, on Tuesday, the head organizer of the Big House Smash Bros. tournament series announced that the event — regarded by fans as one of the marquee annual events in the Smash competitive scene — was going on an indefinite hiatus. The organizer, Robin Harn, cited a number of personal issues as well as broader logistical and industry-related challenges in his decision to put a pause on hosting the event.""

1cevbez,leagueoflegends,Went down memory lane and realized how weird some champions used to be,"1. Zyra's old passive let you shoot out a skillshot similar to a max charge varus Q after dying. The damage wasn't even that significant.
2. Fiddlestick's current passive can be traced back to when they were doing ""joke"" patches. These patches included making master yi/trundle's dance scale with att speed, veigar laughing after ults, and singed laughing after flips. Fiddlesticks got a silly easter egg where if he stood still for 5 seconds, he froze. Later on, they then made it so he got a short burst of movement speed if he moved while being frozen to ""help"" his ganks.
3. Lissandra's old passive let her use 1 spell for no mana cost. Then it went on cooldown.
4. Xerath only had 2 skills, his q and current w. His third skill used to tether him to the ground to ***drastically*** increrase the range of his spells. It was super cool, but not too useful. He eventually got reworked because riot didn't like him feeling like a champion that was super reliant on his ultimate.
5. Draven's passive used to be Darius's bleed.
6. Sona's ult used to be half the width of a lane.
7. Taric was closer to an ap burst mage than a support guardian.
8. Poppy's old ult allowed her to be immune to damage from anyone apart from the person she ulted.
9. Old gangplank's q was the same animation as his crit AA effect. Furthermore, he would build crit, and the auto/AA sounded quite similar. On the topic of gangplank...his ult used to be RNG based and the cannonballs that fell in his ult were not guarenteed to hit.
10. Ashe's hawkshot used to grant gold.

Feel free to add more if I missed any

  
EDIT: Holy crap, I completely forgot a few things.

11. Akali's old ult used to be 3 point/click dashes that did decent damage. When getting a takedown, you got a dash back, turning her into an assassin you couldn't ever run from. Oh, and her E used to be a little spin that did hybrid damage that was on a 1 second cooldown. That too.

12. Diana's E and R used to be swapped, making her super immobile and useless until she hit 6.

13. I think a lot of people know this, but Tahm Kench's W used to be a *nightmare* to balance. His old W was his current ult (the devour), and was far more powerful than what we have currently. His W used to give movement speed if he ate allies. He could eat an ally, and teleport with them across the entire map.

Here are some of the highlights, but you can check out the full thread at the link above:

  
Q: How do you feel about the champ pool accusations?  
  
APA:  I think people have to ban me out to be completely honest.

I think I'm actually quite insane on like a short list of characters. And it's different from Worlds, where the fall off \[on other champs\] was really big, but I think now the fall off is just like average. I think Ahri, for example, is not one of my shortlist characters, but I still feel very like comfortable — even though we lost the game, I think I played decent on Ahri.  


Q: Thoughts on lane swap meta?  
  
APA: Lane swaps are so cringe, it just depends on the character they have. For example, we're banning Oscar's Camille. If they have Camille on the lane swap, she just hookshots on you lvl 1, gets your flash, or a TF flash ghost gold cards you. I think the only point in lane swaps that's cringe for mid lane is just the first three waves. There can just be a random person appearing in your lane for no reason, just because they have no job on the map but to go fuck with you.

  
Q: Any fun stories from MSI so far?  
  
APA: We went to a really spicy hot pot place two, three days ago. Then \[the next day\], the entire time we're trying to do draft and scouting prep, it's just a queue for the restroom, one person after another.

1cn714g,leagueoflegends,Master is an extremely high rank and Master players are very good at the game.,"TL;DR: Being good at anything takes time and effort, you should be proud of your rank, whatever it is, and even more proud of the hard work that got you there. 

Recently I saw a lot of comments saying that Master is trash, those guys can't play the game, Mickey Mouse rank. It's ridiculous that being in the top 0.67% of something can be considered bad. That's why I wanted to provide some real-life examples of being top 1% to make it easier to imagine. I picked 1% as it was easier to find the data, so keep in mind the actual disparity is likely even greater. 

&#x200B;

* **Annual income in the US:** The top 1% earns almost $800k

* **Average height in the US:** The top 1% means at least 5'10'' for women and at least 6'4'' for men

* **Average IQ:** The top 1% means an IQ of at least 135

Bonus: [2% of Americans have a PhD](https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/10cz1e4/so_many_americans_with_phds/), and OP wanted to know how is that considered rare, luckily people in r/phd were able to explain that.

Now imagine if you heard someone say that a 6'4 guy isn't that tall, $800k means nothing because Jeff Bezos makes that in an hour, and people with an IQ of 135 are dumb because Einstein's was higher. You would think they are crazy, and you would be right. 

Yet for some reason, there is a popular take on this subreddit that being in the top 0.67% of the ranked ladder is not that good. High elo starts at rank 1, everyone below that is bad. They aren't good enough to go pro, why even bother queueing up? 

I don't know if that's parroting what streamers/pro players say, an ego boost: ""Yeah I'm gold, but master is trash too!"", or just this community's impossible standards, but I think this shouldn't be the norm.

1gum58m,leagueoflegends,"Whatever happens in 2025, great or bad, will be completely irrelevant if 3 split stays as the ranked system.","The common consensus around this system is that people hate it and they want to go back to 2 Splits or 1 Split like we had before.

3 Split from my experience is pushing it way over the limit in terms of games played, and frustrations with the game arising due to extremely poor match quality.

I would be dumbfounded if Riot came out with DATA and it said that people actually prefer 3 splits and that all relevant metrics are positive in favor of 3 splits.

With regards to 2025 and each split having its own ""identity"", I feel that most of that work will go to waste. There is no way for this system to continue the way it currently is.

It will not generate more players per split, and quite frankly it will struggle to even retain a dwindling player base.

This to me feels like extreme stubbornness on Riots behalf. The same way they handled Dynamic Queue back a a couple of years. You tried something and it did not hit very well with the players.

Swallow the bad news, and just revert back. I am happy to play league of legends over any other game when I feel rewarded for my time. But as soon as you try to milk every second from me, thats when I am going to leave you, and I think a lot of people would feel the same way.",2808,467,1731981611,Negative,0.815,anger,0.539

1h0x2fh,leagueoflegends,The jinx skin is a hard pass for me as a whale because of the sheer low quality of the product and the low value of the offer (pictures and evaluations inside),"Well, here's my whale greeting card...   


[https://imgur.com/a/ISOdSYO](https://imgur.com/a/ISOdSYO)

  
I'm wealthy personally and I love LOL because its my favourite videogame, I'm also a huge fan of arcane and was willing to spend a pretty penny for the Jinx skiin

As you can see on the image I shared, I've bought a lot of mythic variants and the 250$ version of the faker Ahri skin. I pretty much like every one of those champions and I felt that it was a fair deal to get the variant alongside 30+ normal skins from the capsules/rerolls. It has huge value for me because I want every skin in the game in the long term and I actually liked those (for example, I didn't get Yasuo or Yone variants because I don't like playing those champs and I felt that the regular versions of those skins are better)

As for the faker Ahri skin, Ahri is my most played mid laner and I'm a Faker & T1 fan... Felt that although the skin didn't come with 30-40 skins worth of shards, that the skin was a very special skin of a champ and of a player I enjoy. As for why I picked the 250$ bundle and not the 50 or 500 ones is because I didn't like the 50$ butchered version of the skin much and felt like paying double the price of the 250$ bundle for barely anything else had very poor value

NOWWWW... as for the jinx skin... Eventhough I LOVED arcane, was willing to spend money to support such project and really loved Jinx/Powder as a character in the show... I feel that the skin is extremely poorly made for its value and buying it grants me nothing else that I want.... here is a list of my problems with the offer  
  
1) I already have enough ME to drown on so the sanctum granting mainly ME isn't appealing to me  
2) The mythic chromas for the arcane epic skins don't fit them and don't look good in my opinion  
3) Each sanctum roll costs x2 of an orb, and I guess the average roll will give less than 10 ME, which is less than the skin shard the orb gives for over twice the price

And here is a list of my problems with the skin

1) NO HOODIE???? Come on, its such an easy improvement to the skin just to add this toggle, and it has a lot of emotional value for people who loved Jinx and Isha in S2.... What a missed shot  
2) Are there really 3 formes? All I see is 2 identical formes and the AU Powder forme, which is identical to the other from the waist and below.... really? no dress?... such a missed opportunity and it would have made the skin very unique if it actually had a more accurate representation of Powder... as for the 3rd forme I don't even know lol, its just lazy and underwhelming to give Jinx a KDA Akali treatment, who asked for this lol?  
3) The models seem low quality, the gun is the same on all 3 formes except for a small recolour  
4) Although the VFX changes a fair bit, why are the E chompers the same on all formes? so lazy  
5) The rocket model from the ult... its ripped off from a free 975 RP Arcane Jinx skin we got a year or 2 ago.....  
6) The animations are AWFUL... who made these??? Why are Viktor and Jayce legendaries so well made and Vi/Jinx legendary/exalted skins have such bad goofy bouncy animations? They look extremely off  
7) The wild rift epic skin is better than this Exalted skin in my opinion because it has Jinx's most badass/iconic look on S2 and its mainly what people were setting their expectations to get 

The cool about the skin  
1) VFX are nice  
2) a lot of voice lines  
3) The Powder version, although very poorly executed is a cool concept

I could make a long ass review of the Faker Ahri skin telling every single thing I like about it (I don't think I dislike anything about it too), but we're not here to talk about that, I'm here to give constructive criticism on the new Jinx skin in hope that the devs do something about it (and I really hope its not a generic ""we missed the mark"" apology lmao)

So yeah, this skin needs to either be delayed and worked on for it to be actually good if they want to make some sales and I'd also suggest them to add the wild rift jinx epic skin as an epic skin, I'm sure it would sell very well

TL:DR:   
1) Exalted Jinx feels rushed and low quality  
2) The sanctum seems to offer extremely poor value for people who want to collect skins",2792,386,1732685310,Positive,0.658,neutral,0.415

fucking imagine 40 Champs out, having to pick another 10, to ban and the 10 pick in game 5, this cup is going to be maddess, mid lane is going to be a shit show, i can imagine people like lehends picking something braindead fun, keira will pick something like sett support. mids like shoemaker and chovy and maybe faker will be picking shit like elise mid. no one cant say this will be boring this is the best way. no boring game 5 reset

(Top Comment: Over 4000 days later, we failed again trying to climb over this mountain, watch my favorite team, and a full Chinese roster got to finals,  I was really happy, sadly we couldn't left the trophy in the end. I know no team tried to market themselves with the full Chinese squad brand, I know that game and nationality probably doesn't have much relation, but watching Koreans kept reaching success in my favorite game, and some of our own people talking down about ourselves, I couldn't help but feel a bit sad and anger. Shout out to the 5 peat legendary Demon King Faker who refused to thumb down his opponent after a win, congratulation to the legendary T1 team, thank you for creating all the unforgettable moments for the players; Also shout out to the team that former BLG coach Tabe played on in the past, RYL, watching the younger generation fails again in the final, would it brings you back to that day 4000 days ago?

1faswwg,leagueoflegends,"Its funny how calling Garen strong would instantly get you flamed on here, until the pros picked him up","Go look at Garen's patch history over the past few years. Any nerfs he's gotten are negligible and his damage has only gone up. Ever since crit Garen became a thing, he's slowly gotten stronger and stronger, but you couldn't even mention Garen being strong without being called a complete, low-elo idiot. Now all of a sudden people are realizing that he's a burst assassin tank fighter that ignores poke in lane, has the speed of a damn racecar, and executes you from 1/3 of your health - just because the pros are picking him.

And yes, I realize that he's in response to Nasus becoming meta (which honestly a lot of what I just said could apply to him as well), but the pros wouldn't be picking him if he couldn't compete, and he definitely can.

The rating is user poll generated, you can give a rating between 2 and 10, and average is used.

Hupu rating is an in APP feature so it doesn't really have a link, but here is the post match thread for the match, and on the top there is an link you can click on that get you to that page. 

A lot of people only voted for game 5 after the game is over, so game 5 rating is probably less correlated to actual game 5 performance, more resemble an overall rating.

Time flies, I thought about retiring, sell out my dream, and become a streamer, but I popped off in NA, got some good result, and I blended into this team, not locked down by the meta, only summoner with full freedom. No one believe us in the knockout stage, my opponent for quarters is Chovy, I know this is the best shot to prove myself, I don't want to live in your shadow anymore, I'm also talented. I thought about victory at 2-1, I really want to see you head down, crying with regret. In the last game we picked Yone, and you instant locked in the Smolder comp, we are not match in the face of meta and counters, who is the one with regret, I think the answer was clear 4 years ago, real life is not as perfect as those stories, I m still beneath him in the end. Will we meet again next year, I don't know, will FLY change roster, I don't know, where is my next stop, I don't know, same spot I was 4 years ago, some people might never meet again, like Scorpius and Orion, I'm Quad, also a talent, see you next year.)|

1ges6u0,leagueoflegends,Format diff: BLG Bin in last 2 years played more games than RGE Larssen in his entire 5-year LEC career,"There is a lot of talks now about LEC format and the fact that **Rogue this season played just 29 games**, while top organisations like BLG or T1 are playing 150+ games each season. It makes me wonder, who plays more: RGE Larssen his entire LEC career or BLG Bin in last 2 years? Spoiler: **Bin wins**, it Larssen is the one who actually plays a lot by LEC standards.

*Disclaimer: Bin was selected just arbitrarily, if we go for any BLG/T1/Gen.G player, we would see simialr picture.*

* Larssen joined LEC in Summer **2019**, and he made Playoffs in his first season, playing in total 18+7 = **25 games**
* In **2020** he played two full seasons of LEC, twice make it to Playoffs, was qualified to Worlds where was eliminated from Groups Stage (famous ""group of death"" with DWG and JDG). 55 games of LEC + 6 games at Worlds = **61 games** in total
* **2021** is the same story. Two full seasons, twice playoffs, including ""reverse sweep incident"" in Spring Finals against MAD, and Worlds qualification. **72 games in total**, 7 from them at Worlds and 65 in LEC.
* **2022**, and again we see the same. Two full seasons, two playoffs, win in LEC Summer, and even finally qualification from Worlds Groups. **73 games in total**, 10 at Worlds, and 63 in LEC.
* 2023, new LEC format arise. Larssen plays 3 ""Groups"", 3 ""Seasons"" and one Playoff. 51 game in total
* 2024. 29 best-of-1 games during entire year. Nuff said.

In total, in his **5 and half years of LEC career,** including 8 Playoffs runs, multiple Finals and 3 Worlds runs, Larssen played **311 games in total.**

And what about BLG Bin?

170 games in 2023 (180, if we count Demacia Cup as 2023 tournament, but I used to count it as next year tournament), and at least 144 games in 2024 (134 if we again move Demacia to 2023), or **314 games** in total, which is 3 more than Larssen count, and we yet to see Worlds Finals.

Yes, Bin international runs contribute to Bin's count, as he made to 3 Finals + 1 Semis in last 4 tournaments, but the LEC format is clearly the Issue and players just don't play enough, if one of the most successful LEC player in ""new age"" (discarding this year disaster) in his entire career play less than top LPL or LCK teams in 2 years.

I performed very poorly in this competition and disappointed many people.
But the person who was most disappointed was myself.  
Even though I knew I could better than what I showed,but I fall myself and it had a negative impact on the entire team.
I was greatly influenced by the opinions and evaluations of people who were not related to me, I didn't believe in myself and started to push and pressure myself with worries about the future that had not yet happened, which eventually led to panic attacks during the series..
But all I had to think about was my confidence in myself and what people around me thought of me.
People around me gave me advice about this, but I didn't realize it, and it wasn't until I failed big that I realized it.
It may already be late and it will be very difficult, but I will definitely try to change myself.
From now until my last game of the year, I will delete all social media and communities and focus only on myself and the people around me.

For those who are unaware LPL is the first, and so far only, regional where Fearless Mode is implemented for the first stage of tournament. If it draws enough attention and/or it will be deemedsuccess it can be expanded later to the full tournament and increases the chance that other regions picks up on it too.

* LDL (LPL academy) had it introduced 2 years ago into their Bo3s.

Fearless Mode:

* Teams are not allowed to pick champions they have played in the previous games of a series. Each champion can be picked by once for each team/series.

This mode eradicates the possibility of watching super stale Bo3 picks like........Zeri Lulu Yumi Sivir Lucian Nami Azir Oriana Maokai Poppy Vi Sejuani like every game in 2022 for example.

This is infinitely more interesting than 4 adc meta and incentivises new startegies and approaches.

Probably an unpopular opinion but I have no interest in how Tournament Formats are getting changed when you could have been just introduced this to the regionals.

We didn’t win a single map against T1, Gen.G, or Top Esports. We play against LNG; we played against Top Esports, we played against Gen.G, we played against T1, and we played against Weibo. We didn’t win a single map.""



* ""Look, now that I can spoil things for you. Supa, in a scrim against GENJI, went 10-4. It was the only game where I said, wow, we actually fought here. We had a late game against LNG (...) where we made it to minute 40 or 39. And I'll tell you more, so people can be shocked: all the Western teams are in the same situation. Except for FlyQuest, who don’t play against China and Korea.""



* ""G2 won’t go to 0-18, but, seeing the messages they’ve sent... maybe 10-40 or 8-40. Of course, that’s also why Melzhet says what he says.""



* ""I'd like to know how Fnatic is doing in scrims against the top Asian teams. As much as I say this, our scrims against NA were very even. Against FlyQuest, there was one day we went 3-3, against Team Liquid, another day we went 2-3, and against PSG and Play-In teams, they were also very even, we even won. And by the way, for the fans of LATAM, we beat Movistar R7 10-1.""



* ""We also scrimmed against Fnatic and G2 in the last few days, where we lost to both, but obviously it was much more even than against the asians. I think we went 1-4 and 2-3, compared to not winning a single map against Asia. Obviously, the difference is huge, it's huge.""



* ""Before the League Grand Finals, we scrimmed twice against Fnatic and won six out of eight maps. Fnatic and MDK, when they train, you can tell they’re very evenly matched. Even in games against G2, where they can beat you in all of them. But against Asia… T1 beat us in two games by minute fourteen...""



* ""You play against Asia, and the difference is huge, and then you play against FlyQuest, as I mentioned earlier, and in scrims you play six games and end up tied, three-three. I mean, you're there—one game they win, another game you win, one they stomp you, but the feeling is like, wow, okay, this is playable, just like against Team Liquid. I repeat, they are scrims, and now you'll tell me, 'Ibai, that's not an official match.' Okay, it's not an official match. But in official matches, we lose, and in training too. So, what a coincidence that the team that won the LEC is the one that wins the most scrims, and the team that wins Worlds is the one that wins the most scrims.""



* ""That's why I also think that Melzhet, in his statements, which may be more or less well-received, was referring to that, right? When you are training and there's such a gap compared to the Asians, there comes a moment when you think, wow, in this World Cup… Which I repeat, does not justify losing to GAM, it seemed to me like a very tough game to digest, and in fact, I’m still tilted since Monday; I mean, it's crazy, we're almost at Saturday”

1h103j2,leagueoflegends,First Blood is not an objective and should never be something more than a kill that gives extra gold,"I'm really excited for the new season and like everybody else i found new boots aditions /upgrades nice. But there is only one thing that i hope it's gonna get changed and removed is that first blood ""objective"". Like i understand the first tower and first 3 epic jungle monsters but first blood is not like that it has no kinda team play, macro behind it. I cannot talk about proplay but in soloque this is how all firstbloods are given: Someone afking not looking at his/her monitor in jungle at minute 1 while enemy was invading, very random fights around invades that can go both way,  Incredibly talented Riven players who think they can go full auto trade against Darius with ghost on level 1 etc... So you see where i'm getting at, first blood in soloque is just a very random thing that happens with %90 percent of the time because of these chaotic things. And also why someone else's team gets to punished because of one's mistake ? There are just so many things that makes this upcoming mechanic very toxic. If the boot upgrades were not that huge and there were possible options for the team that behind, then i could give it a pass but knowing that this kinda upgrade(https://x.com/Spideraxe30/status/1861534615619428817) only for one team makes first blood objective even more dumb

1dzhww4,leagueoflegends,The amount of people speaking up because they are scared they will be banned for 'soft inting' is hilarious.,"Riot claimed that they have found an ability to detect soft inting.  Obviously there are people that are also just really really bad at lower tiers and they are not just gonna ban all bronze and iron players.  This is literally something everyone has been asking for for years and now.  If you are against it, you are part of the problem.  If the system is finding false positives, they will kinda have to fix it.  My guess is that it will be pretty easy to soft int still, especially below masters.  It will do a lot of good and if you are scared, good.

1douhzk,leagueoflegends,I understand it's how she's been portrayed since the conception of the character but I really feel like Leona's design could have been benefitted if they had added some muscle definition to her as a way to better convey her role her still make her feel powerful even without armor,"https://preview.redd.it/bd6gu6y8xv8d1.png?width=659&format=png&auto=webp&s=ce401b03853a6dc93c74a96663b8413c0e536325

Leon's been skinny since she got added to the game and skins such as Pool Party Leona or even her more ""recent"" subtle redesign in LoR have done very little to challenge that notion. Though regardless she's still ment to be the portrayal of a powerful demi-goddess and warrior priestess to the Solari. A literal sword and shield to her people and I think her heavy armor does well in portraying that story non-verbally. 

When you remove her armor then I think an aspect of her design is lost.  She still has her sword and shield, sure. But by getting rid of her armor it immediately does away with a lot of the things that make her feel *powerful*. and so to suppliment for that, I have a simple suggestion. Simply give her more musclemass. Make her physically appear more dominant even without the armor to retain the same feelings of someone who is unmovable. 

When Kayle got reworked, they told us the reason they had for removing a lot of her bulk was so people would not mistake her for a Tank. For Leona the inverse should be true aswell. Even out of her armor, she should still look like a tank, which can be done easily, simply by giving her more muscles. ",2619,563,1719394413,Neutral,0.699,joy,0.615

I've always seen myself as like a player that is like at a mid bronze skill level (I peaked Bronze 2 on another account) and yet, I've somehow fallen into iron 4:( the rank where like ive literally cringed at bc I thought there was no way I could ever be that bad....

I find league to be like really fun, but recently I've noticed a decline in my skill and it's kind of demoralizing :( just because I enjoy this game and like it as a pastime but I'd at least like to be like at a Silver skill level or smt . But yeahhh also there was a point where the normals matchmaker would place me in like Bronze/Silver games but about a month ago they started putting me in iron games and I was like winning like a decent amount of the iron normals, so i decided to play ranked when i hit level 30 on this new account that I have, and I lost like all of my placements and was placed into iron 2 and eventually fell to iron 4 recently with 1 win and 12 losses :(

It's just demoralizing a bit and like I made a vod of my gameplay in hopes that someone is able to see it and maybe give me tips and like pointers on what im doing wrong which is probably a lot given that im in iron 4 :(

Here's the vod if anyone is interested in seeing me play: [https://youtu.be/7SQmMfh8vfo](https://youtu.be/7SQmMfh8vfo)

My summoner name is AlexisCantUserna

I'll probably send this over to a coach too.

I also made like annotations in the video where I explain my thought process and stuff at some points.

Edit: You could see the response I sent to Coach Curtis on my page since I can't post it on the league subreddit. I found his video very insightful not only like related to my gameplay but also just my mindset around learning League of Legends :) Also I kind of address it there but I really appreciate everyone who responded to this post and has tried to help me!",2603,612,1718767814,Negative,0.421,sadness,0.895

>Riot Games has been informed that LNG Ninebot Esports's player Scout is temporarily restricted from traveling to Worlds 2024. Given this exceptional situation, LNG has been granted approval to field an emergency substitute, with JDG's Yagao stepping in to represent LNG at Worlds 2024.

>We have at times required teams to either utilize a player already on their roster or choose a free agent who had not participated in the previous split. However, due to current visa restrictions and the time-sensitive process for players from China, the available pool of players who can travel to Europe for Worlds is limited. Both the team and the substitute player must reach a mutual agreement to make this arrangement possible, adding another layer of complexity to the situation. Requiring teams to search outside their region for potential substitutes is not considered a viable solution in this case.

>Should the travel restrictions be lifted during the tournament, Scout will be required to travel and compete, with Yagao becoming ineligible. Teams will be provided with at least 72 hours notice before the start time of the next match that Scout would play in.

>Utilizing an emergency substitute is an exceptional, case-by-case decision and is never the preferred option when addressing roster-related issues. Each case undergoes a thorough review and approval process by Riot Gamers Competitive Operations to ensure fairness.

The Scout saga is over; LNG Yagao is officially approved. Of course, it is still up to LNG and Yagao to finalize an agreement.

1d2otdf,leagueoflegends,Ahri Main speaking in regard of the new 5k-60k Ahri skin,"So the new Ahri skin in the Hall of Legends event will have the following price tags:

* Risen Legend Ahri Skin - 5430RP
* Immortalized Legend Ahri Skin - 32430RP
* Signature Ahri Skin Upgrades - 59260RP

As an Ahri main who has bought almost every event pass since I started playing the game, I'm really sad about the price tags for the new Ahri skins in the Hall of Legends event. Ahri is my favorite champion; I began playing after a friend showed her to me. Since then, I've collected 12 or 13 Ahri skins, always getting a skin whenever I can. Like many other champion mains, I've always wanted an ultimate skin for Ahri. Now that an ultimate-like skin is coming to Ahri, the price makes it unreachable, and it being 100% exclusive to this event means that even if I get the money later, I still won't be able to obtain it.

Yes, there is the Risen Legend Ahri skin priced at 5430 RP, but this skin is not ultimate-like. It's at most a legendary skin with a price tag higher than the current ultimate skins in the game.

So, as a dedicated player who plays constantly, buys almost all event passes, and is an Ahri main, my rewards are:

* Getting a new max legendary skin for 5430 RP (pricier than the current ultimate skins in the game).
* Getting a new ""ultimate"" skin for a minimum price of 32430 RP (which I can't afford).
* Having these skins be 100% exclusive to the event, making it impossible to get them in the future.

I understand that this is a special event for Faker, but if the justification for these price tags includes the pass, icons, effects, chromas, and emotes that come with the bundle, I would appreciate having the option to buy just the skin. I'd prefer to pay an affordable price for just the skin rather than face the extremely high price for the skin bundled with extras I may not want.

I hope Riot will make this more accessible for people who want the ultimate skin.

Edit 1: To those saying that my purchasing of passes and Ahri skins is the reason for the high prices:

First, it’s true that I have a lot of Ahri skins, but I never said I bought all of them. I bought only two skins at a discount, and I got the rest through rewards in chests and event passes.

Second, for those saying, ""Riot prices things this way because you buy them,"" yes, I do buy them. What’s the problem? So, if I want lower prices, I can’t buy them, but if I can’t buy them, why would there be lower prices? I buy the event passes because I think they offer good value for the price, and I can support the creators of a free game that I enjoy playing while getting rewards in return.

This way, I’m supporting the game and enabling more future events and content. Implementing a pass with a completely predatory price means that regular buyers of event passes either can’t afford it or will miss out on new content because they can’t pay the full price for all the rewards.

All the money that i spent in game until now isnt remotely enought to buy the pass with the ultimate skin, not even half of it.",2515,630,1716916642,Neutral,0.472,sadness,0.982

1h893ow,leagueoflegends,"Feats of Strength should be ""kill 300 minions"" instead of First Blood","Designer Riot Endstep posted a [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wxb8Z_RQpPU) explaining his goals and thought process when designing Feats of Strength.

The decision to make first blood one of the objectives has been very controversial. I completely understand why they'd consider it, it is very straightforward and easy to understand, and currently gives a bonus. However I believe there are a lot of problems that could come from it that I'd like to describe: 

#1. First blood is too easy to achieve

Compared to the other objectives, first blood is really easy to achieve. Taking first tower or 3 epic jungle monsters is a teamwide effort that you can't realistically do until 10-12 minutes, while first blood can be decided before minions spawn. This means that most of the time first blood is going to be the thing that decides which team gets boot upgrades, which is too much for something you have so little control over. 

#2. Teams don't have agency over first blood

First tower and 3 epic jungle monsters are objectives that are very difficult to achieve on your own. Everyone will have some control over whether your team wins. First blood is often decided by one player alone. If one of your laners get solo killed level 2 or dies to invade because they were tabbed out there's nothing you can do about it. I'm concerned that this could create a lot of friction in game and lead to toxicity. 

#3. First blood should not be really valuable 

Right now first blood does not matter all that much. While early gold is very powerful if you can get an item advantage from it, 100 gold is not always going to be enough. First blood is going to be the deciding factor in at least a plurality of games because of how easy it is to achieve, which means you're getting 500-750 gold of stats from boot upgrades, plus the access to tier 3 boots from 1 kill. 

#4. 5 man bot could happen

I'm not saying that it's going to happen or even that it's likely, but the fact that it's even possible should be seriously concerning. If on day 1 of pro play in S15 we see pro teams decide that winning feats is really important, so they send 5 bot level 1 to get first blood from a level 1 dive that's going to be really awful for the viewers. Losing early waves could be worth it if boot upgrades are powerful enough.

#5. Rewarding first blood sends the wrong message

Endstep talked about how he wanted to give new players more guidance on what they should do in the early game and that Feats of Strength is supposed to help with this. However kills in League of Legends are not that important on their own.
One of the things I've noticed a lot is that inexperienced players value kills way too highly, to the point where they will drop multiple waves to chase 0/5/0 Sion across the map. What actually makes kills valuable is the waves you can deny from it. 

That's why I believe the first blood objective should be ""kill 300 minions"" instead. 300 is a nice round number that is achievable around 12 minutes in the game. This feat emphasises the importance of pushing and last hitting, it encourages players to maximise their individual gold and exp income, and it's something the entire team can contribute to.

Maybe the concern about Feats of Strength is overblown or maybe it isn't, but either way I wanted to articulate my own thoughts and contribute to the discussion.",2498,391,1733512217,Neutral,0.55,neutral,0.806

For challengers he was:

* 5th most played mid laner in 14.12
* 5th most played mid laner in 14.13
* 5th most played mid laner in 14.14
* 3rd most palyed mid laner in 14.15
* **The number 1** most palyed mid laner in 14.16
* 2nd most palyed mid laner in 14.17 (smolder mid had 1% bigger pick rate)
* **The number 1** most palyed mid laner in 14.18 -> *bruiser build with stride became a thing*
* **The number 1** most palyed mid laner in 14.19 -> 5th most picked champion in all 5 roles. (4th is rell, 3rd is jhin, 2nd is viego, 1st is kaisa)

This is not a popularity case.

If a champion is popular in challenger it means it's really really strong and borderline OP. Funny that stridebreaker was only caught up in 14.18. Before that Yone was building botrk into crit and was doing well...

Lets analyse what makes Yone strong:

* He has a flex (mostly played on mid...),
* He is an AD mid, making Aurora and Rumble better choices for pro
* Relly safe into most picks right now and especially good into mages
* Good, flexible items with great power spike
* Ultimate is an engage and disengage spell
* Q3 rlly solid for pro play

For a long time BotRK is a staple 1st item. Why? BECAUSE HIS CRITS ITEMS ARE THRASH!!!

* Yone needs Attack Speed way more than crit
* Yone builds Immortal Shieldbow and Infinity Edge. Neither of these has Attack Speed
* Blade of the Ruined King has AD, Attack Speed, Life Steal and its ability allows him to fight with tank and squishies.

Buffing his crit was a measily excuse to deliver another buff to an already popular and strong pick for no real reason.

Over time, the game's focus has shifted from solo carry to more team-oriented gameplay. This change has led to an increase in skirmishes, such as 2v2, 2v3, 3v3, and 3v4 fights.

* The trend towards higher champion durability has affected champions like Yone and Yasuo. They can no longer easily pick off squishy targets or dominate 1v1 situations as they used to.
* In the past, these champions could outplay opponents by dealing significantly more damage while being much more vulnerable themselves. However, this playstyle has become less effective in the current meta.

There came the Stridebreaker?

* AD, ATTACK SPEED, 450 Health.
* It slows enemies hit by it's active by 35% and GRANTS Yone 35% MS for each enemy hit for 3 seconds

TL;DR Yone is squishy but extremely opressing and pressuring champion with mixed damage, with 2 different knockups, ghosted movement speed boost and shield. Bruiser builds allows him to deal similar damage while allowing him to stay in combat for longer because it eliminates his biggest weakness. No other champion with such a high priority and success rate in challenger and 93% presence in pro play are supposed to recevie a buff after an item he build 3rd or 4th recevies 200 gold nerf...

With the end of Arcane, there's still room for an entire show's worth of content with the ""New generation of P&Z"" (Camille, Zeri, Blitzcrank, Orianna, Seraphine, Renata, Urgot, Zac...), basically all the champions who didn't appear or briefly and whose lores will be affected by Arcane being the new canon. Of course, I doubt we'll be back in PiltoZaun very soon, but still I wanted to explore what could be done with Seraphine's character, one of the many who will need their lore changed :

[Probably one of if not the most controversial release ever](https://preview.redd.it/p9uv9cilj88e1.jpg?width=1215&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=41e38a3218ac8e52c7f0143e38f3cd62b0bad53c)

**Quick recap of Sera's lore, skip if you know it well :**

*For the few unaware : Seraphine's lore (one of the most controversial ever) upon release was that she could hear the voices of the Brackern, the crystal scorpions whose bodies were used by Piltover to craft Hex crystals, who inhabited her Hextech-powered platform created by her inventor father. This was due to her having some kind of magic synesthesia that lets her hear other's souls through magic, this ability has inspired her to make music to express others' emotions for her, leading to her becoming some kind of pop-star.*

*While this is extremely tone deaf since the Brackerns were victims of a genocide, and was retconned pretty quickly to her only hearing unidentifiable echoes, there are other interesting elements in Seraphine's lore :*

*She's a Piltie born to Zaunite parents who got rich and moved to the upper-city, and is a naive idealist who hopes to unite both cities through music. Throughout her teenage years, she spent time upgrading her stage, going on trips to Zaun and made friends there. LoR then expended upon that lore to showcase more of her involvement in Zaun and her craftier side with her pet Acorn helping her and her father make stuff.*

With all that down, there's a major question to answer : *Seraphine's lore revolves at least partly around the echoes she heard in the hearing-aids (later stage) her father made for her.*

**But the Brackern no longer exist, so whose voice does Seraphine hear now ?**

The Brackern are gone, and the energy source behind Hextech is now the Arcane, the general source behind all magic in Runeterra, seemingly, and who is it that now presumably inhabit the Arcane following their disappearance ? **Viktor and Jayce.**

Again, Seraphine is a character who is :

*- An idealist trying to unite Piltover and Zaun*

*- A character who lives in Zaun but has origins and friends in Zaun*

*- The daughter of something like an engineer who is herself somewhat proficient in Hextech machinery*

This matches so well with Viktor and Jayce's own stories it's almost absurd, both are scientists who originate, one from Piltover, and the other from Zaun, trying to achieve peace for both cities, who ultimately failed and disappeared while in their thirty-somethings.

Seraphine's lore could be retconned to have her hear Viktor and Jayce's voices faintly and rarely at first, to her being able to communicate with them often after she's found her place as a musician, when she's aged and her magic gained in strength. This would effectively make them her mentors, guiding her in her attempt to appease relations between Zaun and Piltover and navigating her interpersonal relationships like with ~~her Zaunite girlfriend~~ the Zaun Diva (with whom her idealistic personality and privileged upbringing could create conflict), using their own experiences and failures.

Seraphine's story would then be not only about her role in the conflict between Zaun and Piltover, but also be about the internal conflict between her newfound responsibility as the only one capable of hearing the voices of the creators of Hextech and use their knowledge and insight to help P&Z, and her desire to pursue her already half-fulfilled music dreams. This I feel would resonate a lot with all the people IRL forced to give up or on or change their dreams by their environment, and would make Seraphine more interesting and nuanced.

**So to summarize the retcon would :**

\- Keep Viktor and Jayce existing in the Runeterra canon as supporting characters for the new generation after them, not completely undermining the impact of their death but also keeping beloved characters sort of alive and as players in the grand scheme of things.

\- Make Seraphine go from one of the most detestable characters in the lore to a character that has the potential to be a kind of successor to two of the coolest champions in the lore.

\-Make Seraphine's stance on the Piltover/Zaun conflict actually impactful, yes, as a pop star, she's bound to have some political influence over commoners, but that isn't enough to make her actually important in the grand scheme of things. She's on something like Vander levels of influence in terms of number of people who know her, and the opinions of a teenage girl are definitely not as important as those of a man like Vander to people. Her being backed by two of the most intelligent characters in the region could make her much more important :

**A few exmples of how things could go :**

*-A disillusioned Seraphine, frustrated with her ideals hitting the wall of reality, and potentially manipulated by Renata, could end up choosing armed revolution and help conceive Chemtech weapons using Viktor/Jayce's knowledge to give Zaun a means to achieve an actual revolution*

*-Seraphine sides with Piltover, uses Jayce's knowledge of the political system of Pïltover as a former counciler and Jay/Vik's knowledge to gain a more serious image as opposed to her pop star persona and becomes respected by the Council. She becomes a council member and from there either tries to change the system or is slowly fully brought over to Piltover's side by their influence.*

*-Seraphine gains a massive ego following her short rise to fame + her contributions to science being attributed to her despite them really being Jay/Vik's, forgets her roots and lets the Council play on that weakness, becoming a tool of propaganda for Piltover through her status as a pop star.* 

*-Or to the contrary she tries to be a second Jinx and becomes a symbol for the new revolution, all the while being manipulated by Renata and losing touch with what actually benefits the people of Zaun (in other words, a foil to Zeri).*

The possibilites are pretty much infinite if you go down this route.

All this while fitting perfectly with the Arcane canon.

Did I cook chat ?

Edit : Man I thought I was cooking only for me to end up grilled by the comments 😭😭 Not saying anyone's wrong but just to clarify, I'm not saying Seraphine needs to be the focus of PiltoZaun : Season 3 : The final chapters Part two Part three if it happens eventually, I'm just saying that her lore needs to be changed now either way and this is how they could do it.

1gdw6rd,leagueoflegends,A reflection written by an LPL caster translated ,"“When Faker won his first championship, Zeus was only 9 years old.""

Time can have a strange way of creating surreal moments. If you simply mention an 8-year age gap, it doesn't feel like much. But placing a ‘championship win’ and ‘9 years old’ side by side makes it feel like an entire era apart.

Because 9 years old is still a child. And winning a championship—that’s for adults.

Bin is a year older than Zeus.

He reached his first finals in 2020, at 17. That year, due to COVID restrictions, the Pudong Football Stadium wasn’t open to spectators.

People stayed home, eyes fixed on their screens.

""Who is that?""

“Fiora.”

“I know Fiora. I mean, who’s playing her?”

Esports loves youth. But it also bullies youth. It embraces them first, lets them enter the arena—then it bullies them.

Esports loves veterans, too. But it bullies them first. If they prove resilient, then it might embrace them.

And now, it’s another year.

Different groups measure time in different ways.

For students, a year is measured in semesters, counting down to winter and summer breaks.

For seniors in high school, time is counted by months, as they move from one exam to the next.

For those working in offices, it’s quarters, always gearing up for the next quarterly review.

But esports fans measure a year by the season. To us, when Worlds ends, so does the year.

When we’re young, we think of life as long and boundless, don’t we? We waste time, never noticing any signs of aging between yesterday and today.

And yet, with just a shift in perspective, the youthful days of bright ambitions have faded to gray at the temples, and once-vibrant spirits are now touched by the weariness of age. Only then do we realize how relentlessly time flows.

It’s like the long cycle of seasons—spring outings, summer sprints—we feel each year stretching on forever. But as autumn fades and winter sets in with a sudden chill, we realize another year has slipped by.

Along the Seine, autumn waters seem to flow upstream, and soon, this year’s heroes will take the stage in all their grandeur.

I often feel that time itself doesn’t exist. It’s the events, the people, that mark its increments and give memory its anchor points.

Years from now, what will be our memory points from 2024?

“2024? Wasn’t that the year BLG and T1 faced off?”

“2020. Fiora! Bin later said he wasn’t strong enough that year.”

“2013. Faker’s first championship, right? Haha, Zeus was only 9 back then.”

“Speaking of, who did win in 2024?”

May this serve as our encouragement for the LPL

[https://x.com/THEPLAY\_SPG/status/1859878067147243711](https://x.com/THEPLAY_SPG/status/1859878067147243711)

TL;DR: So yeah, we *totally* did everything by the book to avoid concluding a contract with T1, and somehow everyone else *misunderstood* us. Also, can y’all stop being mean to us online? 

Here are some intriguing highlights:

• The Play firmly stated that “a 3 p.m. deadline was set for T1 at the request of Hanwha Life Esports.”

• While negotiations technically began on the 12th, The Play didn’t make their first counter-offer until 11:40 a.m. on the final day, November 19th. Just four hours later, they finalized the deal with HLE.

• At 3:20 p.m., The Play sent a second counter-proposal to T1 but terminated the negotiation with T1  just 10 minutes later at 3:30 p.m., without waiting for a response.

Edit: Added TL;DR; Added some highlights.

Translation:

>

**Statement Regarding the Transfer of Player ‘Zeus’ Choi Woo-jae**

>

>Hello, this is **ThePlay**, the agency representing player **‘Zeus’ Choi Woo-jae**.

>

>We sincerely thank all the fans who have continuously supported Choi Woo-jae. We also deeply apologize for the concerns caused to fans due to the recent issue regarding Choi Woo-jae’s transfer.

>

>Recently, Zeus transferred from T1 to **Hanwha Life Esports**, and fans have been expressing various opinions regarding his transfer. Respecting Choi Woo-jae’s wishes to avoid escalating disputes with his previous team, T1, which had been his close ally, our agency initially refrained from making an official statement on this matter.

>

>However, as the AMA session announced on the early morning of November 22 contained factual inaccuracies and other misleading content, the agency decided to investigate the facts by consulting with both **Hanwha Life Esports** and Choi Woo-jae, and to issue an official statement.

>

>Our intention is to clearly communicate the facts to prevent misunderstandings and damage, and to sincerely convey the positions of both Choi Woo-jae and our agency. We hope that this statement will deliver the truth about Choi Woo-jae and that it will stop any groundless criticism directed at him.

>

>Here is the translation of the table content:

>**11/19 15:30** Negotiations concluded due to T1’s inability to accept the counter-proposal Final decision made by: The Agency

**Summary:**

>

2. During the priority negotiation period before the 19th, the agency consistently engaged in good faith discussions with T1, even while emphasizing their desire to assess the player’s market value in the free agency market.

>3. On the 19th, despite entering the free agency market, neither the agency nor Choi Woo-jae agreed to any direct discussions with T1 before 10 a.m. or after 3 p.m.

>4. On the 19th, the negotiations with T1 continued constructively, without considering overseas transfers. A 3 p.m. deadline was communicated to T1 per the request of Hanwha Life Esports.

>

>The negotiations ultimately concluded as T1 was unable to meet the terms by 3:30 p.m., leading to a termination of the talks.

>

>

**Detailed Stance of the Agency:**

>

>**1. Position of the Agency and Choi Woo-jae Regarding the Contract Terms**

>

>• From the beginning of his professional career during the T1 training period, Choi Woo-jae devoted himself exclusively to T1. He expressed his wish to remain with T1 out of loyalty and affection, even if it meant sacrificing better opportunities elsewhere. This was communicated clearly to the agency.

>• During the 2023 FA market negotiations, T1 presented contract terms that were unacceptable. The agency supported Choi Woo-jae in exploring other teams while still leaving the final decision to him. However, Choi Woo-jae ultimately chose to pursue direct final negotiations with T1, demonstrating his loyalty.

>• Entering the 2024 FA market, Choi Woo-jae acknowledged T1’s legacy and agreed to negotiate under the condition that he would prioritize a T1 re-signing if the terms were reasonable and matched offers from other teams. Despite this, T1 made offers that failed to reflect the player’s contributions, particularly as a key team member in securing back-to-back World Championship victories.

>• T1 claims that the conditions proposed reflected a long-term vision for the player. However, the proposed terms were not objectively advantageous to Choi Woo-jae, making it difficult for him to agree.

>• The final terms proposed by the agency to T1, including monetary aspects, options, and duration, were not met by T1 in any way. Consequently, Choi Woo-jae ultimately signed with Hanwha Life Esports under conditions more favorable to him.

>

>The belief that Choi Woo-jae prioritized overseas transfer over T1 due to contract terms is entirely false.

>

>

>**2. Negotiations and Counteroffers During the Priority Period**

>

>• After receiving T1’s initial proposal, the agency consistently conveyed its stance that it wanted to evaluate Choi Woo-jae’s market value during the free agency (FA) period. T1’s proposal cited the team’s financial situation and the introduction of a salary cap system, arguing that this could limit the player’s value.

>• The agency, prioritizing accurate market evaluation, chose not to make an immediate counteroffer but rather to confirm Choi Woo-jae’s value in the FA market before initiating further discussions.

>• The agency’s stance was that, instead of making a hasty decision, it would prioritize protecting the player’s rights by ensuring contract terms aligned with market standards.

>• Despite not making counteroffers, negotiations with T1 were conducted earnestly. Even after the FA evaluation, Choi Woo-jae expressed his firm intention to remain with T1 if the terms were competitive.

>• The claim that the agency did not negotiate actively or was simply waiting for other offers is inaccurate. The agency negotiated continuously while also ensuring transparency about the FA market evaluation process.

>

>**3. Negotiations and Deadlines on November 19**

>

>• The agency did not agree to any direct meetings with T1 before 10 a.m. or after 3 p.m. on November 19.

>• During the FA period, the agency consistently communicated its intention to evaluate market offers first before finalizing any agreements. On November 19, the agency requested a deadline of 3 p.m. to finalize the negotiation process.

>• Negotiations continued past the 3 p.m. deadline, but no agreement was reached due to T1’s inability to accept the proposed terms. It was emphasized that the 3 p.m. deadline was set upon Hanwha Life Esports’ request.

>• The extended deadline until 3:30 p.m. was also not sufficient to finalize any agreements. Despite the ongoing negotiations, both parties ultimately concluded that no further extensions were possible.

>

>**4. Communication After the Contract Conclusion**

>

>• After the negotiations ended, the agency reached out to T1 on November 21 to express regret and understanding regarding the situation.

>• The agency refrained from making any additional public statements, instead choosing to handle the matter privately.

>• The agency regrets any misunderstandings caused by accusations suggesting the situation was their fault.

>

>**Additional Notes**

>

>• The FA market operates under time-sensitive conditions, with decisions often needing to be made quickly. The agency emphasized that the decision to move forward was made solely due to market constraints and was not influenced by any personal grudges.

>• The agency clarified that there were no agreements or proposals made regarding contract extensions, even though discussions continued until the deadline.  
**5. Closing Remarks**

>Although there have been misunderstandings and incorrect information, we have prioritized explaining the key aspects of the situation. All our claims are based on verified communication and decisions made between Choi Woo-jae, Hanwha Life Esports, and our agency.

>

>We aim to convey the facts clearly, express our regret for the misunderstandings with T1, and request an end to the negative public discourse and unnecessary controversy around this matter.

>

>With this statement, we have fully communicated the agency’s position. We earnestly ask fans to respect both the agency’s and Choi Woo-jae’s stance, and to refrain from any groundless criticism or unwarranted backlash.

1d7uqdr,leagueoflegends,I think Yasuo/Yone are champions that would survive a mini rework away from crit and the entire ADC class would be better off without them.,"I personally dont have an issue with either, but they share the item pool of an entire class of champions, and when this class is strong, these 2 get really obnoxious and when ADC are weak, these 2 become useless.

Yasuo and Yone have many build paths that make sense on paper like BORK rush or Triforce (which Yasuo has used in the past) but that cant be utilized because of their passives. They need 2 crit items to fully utilize their passives. Even if you dont always see crit rush right now, at some point you need it.

I think there is room to remove crit dependance from both Yasuo and Yone, and shift their power to more AD, Attack Speed and HP and Haste. That way it opens up the item market for them, and ADC champions wont have their items gutted or nerfed because of 2 melee champions sharing an item pool with them.

I've always enjoyed the crit mechanic on these 2 champions, and I have played them a lot, but if its something that I want to give up to be better balanced around items, its this passive. I think its a win win for everyone in the long run.

There are items that exist that these champions cant even begin to use with their current scaling. Black Cleaver, Spear, the entire lethality pool of items, etc..",2321,488,1717500228,Negative,0.581,disgust,0.542

Genuinely, at this point Noxus might as well be Swain Draven and Darius in a country full of Leblancs backstabbing each other, the funniest thing it's that sometimes it goes so far that it just makes Noxus seem more akin to a skaven country where backstabbing each other 24/7 is part of the culture ",2287,125,1732249752,Negative,0.624,disgust,0.483

By this time, its cooldown its 5.8 seconds.","With his normal Fleet Footwork page with Legend Haste and a normal build of Cooldown Boots > Triforce > Frozen Heart > Spirit Visage > Steraks > Sunderer Nasus has access to 73 Haste.

The Slow not only slows movement speed and allows Nasus to run you down, but it cripples you heavily as well so you can never fight back. Something that was REMOVED from Lee Sin E many years ago beacuse it was broken to have a quick spammable cripple and slow on a champion that could get on top of you very easily.

Fiora also saw her W nerfed a while back where her cripple went from 50% to 25%.

I dont have an issue with Nasus. I think he presents a unique challenge in toplane. Both to play as, and play against. But Nasus is already strong on basically all fronts in his kit and this W in its current iteration makes it simply impossible to 1v1 him, even if you yourself are in a strong state.

His Passive gives him Bloodthirster Levels of Lifesteal, his Q is spammable which is fine. His W has way too short of a cooldown which leaves no window to actually punish Nasus. His E is fine because AP Nasus is a massive noob bait that generally does not work very well in higher elos. HIs ultimate gives him basically an entire item worth of stats, but its also FINE.

Its just the W that makes it unplayable. Some champions are able to go Phase Rush against him, like Garen and Darius, but that only allows them to survive. Now they lack the damage to actually kill him without Conqueror.

I think Nasus should be strong in the mid game, but at least give the opponent a chance to fight. You can argue that Nasus has a rough early game, but its certianly not true anymore today like it was in Season 5/6/7.

Most matchups are extremely manageable with 3 points in E and Aery. You lifesteal up basically all poke from rough lanes with passive, Q damage, Second Wind, Dorans Shield and health regen.

If you are a smart Nasus player, you easily get to mid game in an even state, maybe slightly behind at worst. 

How is this W not a problem, when Ryze was reworked for basically the same thing? W root being spammable if you did a certain combo. You keep a champion in place and you kill them with little to zero counter play.

Increase the cooldown, or make the cooldown start after Wither has run its course. It should not stay in this current iteration.

Edit: Cripple is 75% of slow amount. Max cripple is 71%. Also Wrote 99% instead of 95% in the title.",2278,707,1728601972,Negative,0.491,neutral,0.663

>Hello, I am UmTi of Team Liquid Honda. I apologize to Levi, GAM Esports Team, and the Vietnamese esports fans who may have been hurt by my disrespectful interview after the match with GAM Esports Team at the last World Championship. I personally apologized to Levi yesterday, and I'm grateful that he understood. Levi is a great hero of Vietnamese esports who has made a significant impact in the field. His excellent character as a professional gamer has been a great learning experience for me as well. Many Vietnamese esports fans have supported me despite my shortcomings, and I'm sorry for disappointing you with this mistake. In the future, I will be more careful and work harder to show you a more humble version of UmTi as a professional gamer that you can be proud of. Thank you.

He also apologized in Vietnamese too: [https://x.com/UmTi0602/status/1846983524194439320](https://x.com/UmTi0602/status/1846983524194439320)

The interview he is apologizing for is after beating GAM in the Swiss Stage.

1dtwisc,leagueoflegends,Gen.G is currently on the longest series win streak in LoL history,"Wasn't sure how known it was, but this current iteration of Gen.G (Kiin, Canyon, Chovy, Peyz, Lehends) has won **24 series in a row**, starting from their week 4 win vs HLE in LCK 2024 Spring on Feb. 17 this year. 

The previous record was 21 straight series wins (only counting BO3 & BO5) which was held by both 2022 T1 (Zeus, Oner, Faker, Guma, Keria) and 2012-13 World Elite (Caomei, Clearlove, Misaya, Weixiao, Fzzf) who were tied. 

The next group after that is 3 teams tied at 18 straight series wins: 2016 EDG (Mouse, Clearlove, Scout/PawN, Deft, Meiko), 2018 IG (TheShy/Duke, Ning, Rookie, Jackeylove, Baolan), and 2014-15 EDG who changed their roster in the midst of their streak (Koro1/AmazingJ, Clearlove, U/PawN, Namei/Deft, Meiko/Mouse). 

In total I found 42 different instances (from the major regions) of teams who won at least 10 straight series at some point. [Full list if anyone is interested.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1x-4bFMTgmXULXUmFxyDrUowh6ajwCbsV/view?usp=sharing)",2265,457,1719953836,Positive,0.529,neutral,0.89

> Of course we are disappointed. We thought our efforts finally cracked the code, that it was our time to win it all, that it was doable. Eliminating T1 would have been the incredible start of a glorious and legendary weekend. But those recent wins were only a few steps forward, to be reminded by Faker himself that we are not ready yet. Thank you for the humbling, fuck you for the loss, see you soon for the revenge.
> 
> We went all-in for this MSI, opting for a really intense schedule. As many scrims/games as possible, balanced with daily recovery (sport/meditation/1o1/breathing), healthy nutrition (long live brocolis), strict schedule (3 pushups/1min late) and lot of game-related blocks (soloQ/VOD/1v1/2v2). The boys showed excellent discipline and were fully committed to the adventure. We had this common belief that we were on a great mission, and it scaled pretty well. The goal was for everyone to stay healthy (mind and body) until the end, so we could deliver the hardest punchs when it mattered the most.
> 
> It started with a 10 days bootcamp, to get into the rythm, adapt to jetlag, food, cultural chock, level up soloQ accounts, content/press, adapt our Berlin processes.
> 
> Our first official encounter was a banger, and probably our most interesting BO5 despite the loss. We pushed T1 to game 5, a needed confirmation that we are not ""just"" good domestically after the Worlds23 traumatic experience. It gave us the boost needed to dive deeper into the competition. 
> 
> The PSG game was a real challenge as everyone was giving us winners, a powerful external narrative which can lead to carelessness. Underestimating your opponent, even unconsciously, easily leads to elimination. I'm proud of the players for the focused attitude they brought to the serie.
> 
> The TES game was interesting. They did not offer us the fight we were expecting, so we ended up going full speed into a seemingly weakened opponent. Our botlane had a statement game and it was a joy to watch.
> 
> Friday's game versus T1 was a frustrating experience. Despite good drafts and early game leads, we could not snowball our advantages. They pressured us in surprising ways, clicking better in most teamfights, outplaying us on clutch moments. The World Champions showed up and we could not close a single game. It was their day. GGWP.
> 
> Those international events are invaluable in terms of learnings. We played as many Bo5 in 7 days as in 2 full splits of LEC. 
> We scrimmed versus the best for weeks, learning from their strenghts while they were challenging ours. We played in front of thousands of people cheering for us. 
> 
> We are now back in Europe.
> Proud of the boys, a great fellowship of fighters, it's a daily honor to build memories together.
> I want to praise my staff, as we have a crew of badass humans, and the job done by Dylan, Rodrigo, Duffman and Isma to keep the team honest and accountable is a pleasure to experience. They are masters at their craft and they're keeping the leveling up possible.
> Thanks to all our fans for their support. Your positives messages are seen. You guys make us feel special, so we will make you proud. Keep the hopium warm, we will get the trophy. A few more months of grinding. And when they land in Europe, when the time comes to defeat them in front of our people, we shall be ready.

# DAMAGE PREDICTION
- Added damage prediction settings. Damage prediction allows clients to immediately play the audio/visual effects of inflicting damage without waiting for confirmation from the server. Damage prediction can make shooting feel significantly more responsive, but comes with the risk of occasionally being wrong (e.g. due to aim punch, tagging, or a death that your client isn't yet aware of).
- Predicted body shot effects (disabled by default), head shot effects (disabled by default), and kill ragdolls (enabled by default) can each be toggled separately.
- Damage prediction is not active when you have high ping.

# ANIMATION
- Updated the third-person animation that plays when a player is blinded by a flashbang. The animation now accurately represents the player's visibility level, and the pose will only show the player's arm covering their eyes when they are completely blinded.
- Fixed a case where legs weren't animating correctly while taking damage.

# GRAPHICS
- Added ambient occlusion for first person legs to better ground them in the environment.
- Performance optimizations for molotov and incendiary effects.

# GRENADES
- Added axis labels to the grenade line-up reticle tick marks.
- The grenade preview camera now shows the result of a jump throw while the jump button is held.

# MAP GUIDES
- Added a map guide for Train, which demonstrates four simple Terrorist grenade line-ups. To load a map guide, go to Play→Practice and toggle ""Load Map Guides"" on.
- Added concommands annotation_* which enable the creation, saving, and loading of map guide nodes and files, which are stored in /annotations/.

# MISC
- New game settings for radar map blending and background opacity.
- Fixed a case where progress from a previously completed Armory Pass would show during activation of a new pass.
- Fixed a regression with Chinese input via the Microsoft Input Methods.
- CSTV now allows setting tv_delay and tv_delay1 to a value smaller than 6 seconds.
- Charm Template number is now available in Charm descriptions.

# MAPS

### Train
- **Added Train to Competitive, Casual, and Deathmatch modes.**

### Community Maps

- Replaced some windows with opaque surfaces in train station to remove bad lines of sight.
- Deleted a tree that interfered with a line of sight.
- Moved one of the crate lids on A-site to block a bad line of sight.
- Removed some lamps that could look like player heads at A-site.
- Removed some trees and objects around park and train station that prevented players from backing into certain useful spaces.
- Removed a chain link fence in alley that made players hard to see.
- Adjustments to fog and decreased the distance at which character models get an increased visibility effect.
- Made shelf in heaven look less like a player.
- Adjusted props and lights in heaven to reduce noise and make players brighter.
- Removed handcart behind barrels at B-site so players can back into the corner.
- Adjusted collision around barrels for better player movement.
- Added light behind barrels for better player visibility.
- Fixed weird collision on barrel that made for inconsistent wall bangs.
- Fixed bad graffiti rendering at B-site.
- Removed concrete block behind the cement bags at B-site for less awkward player movement.
- Set many smaller props to exclude player movement and grenade bounces.
- Fixed some pixel peeks.
- Small visual updates throughout the map.

### Shoots
- Performance improvements in some areas.

https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/1fyhja2/mouse_x_isnt_subtick_related_discoveries_about/


For those who are not familiar with cs2's strange world of subtick, long time ago a video posted about ""your shots are not responding correctly"" like title spreaded, and since them, people really got interested to really know what subtick was really about. [Why You Might Be Missing Your Shots in CS2 – THE PROBLEM WITH SUBTICK UPDATES (youtube.com)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eandoX7Jsh4)

i've decided to go beyond, and see how subtick could mess with our mouse axys. for that i've used some aliases to help me:

alias +test ""+attack;sensitivity 0;""; alias -test ""-attack; sensitivity (mysens); bind mouse1 +test;

what is the purpose of those aliases? simple: every time i flickshot, mouse1 input instantly stop my mouse movement (mouse\_x;mouse\_y) at the same time the bullet goes out, suposely going for the same pixel.

but UNSURPRISINGLY NOT, they dont.

actualy it seems to have a random behavior, similarly to the video test using +turnright commands (apparently de-subticked), but now with mouse movement only (a more realistic scenario).

shots and mouse movements do not behave together, making me understand that +attack is correctly added to subtick, but not mouse\_x (mouse's movement)

[alias test without accurate shots, 1000hz polling rate](https://reddit.com/link/1fy0ra1/video/vc89u7wjv9td1/player)

[my mouse config for the video above](https://preview.redd.it/jh9egqvvv9td1.png?width=1018&format=png&auto=webp&s=e943fe24b8270c5a550048ee2d7c01313610e2f2)

but the story doesnt end here. it seems that when turning down the mouse Hz to 125 (competitivly unplayable), this behavior seems to end, and now, the shots are going exactly as expected, like csgo was on it peak

[alias test with accurate shots, with 125hz polling rate](https://reddit.com/link/1fy0ra1/video/l7zu23lsv9td1/player)

is it good like this? doesnt it mess with flickshots, probably nerfing even more AWP shots? why the hell should this be a feature? thanks valve for some updates lately, but please... fix? i really have no clue at this point


EDIT: No, lowering you hz Would make you mouse less responsive and add inputlag.

As i said, it is competitivly unplayable.
The real question is, why 125hz seems more precise and logical? When we know that it is the oposite. Always try to use the highest polling rate avaliable, that is possible for the game to read ",681,61,1728280450,Positive,0.538,surprise,0.613

However, comming on Reddit or other media and shitposting simply to cry about it has come too far. At this point, even if you don't care about cheaters, content, and optimisarion, it is still impossible to enjoy whatever the game *does have* to offer (which is quite a lot). The reason why enjoying it is totally impossible is largely due to the community only making butthurt shitposts everywhere and being, by the feeling of it, the most toxic it has ever been. 

It also directly breaks the ""Rule 2"" of this community, but the mods seem not to care too much.

All has been said millions of times. We need not hear *you in particular* cry about it for the 77654th time. The hate is partially justified, but is totally ridiculous in proportions and attitude.

Installed cs2 cuz I heard it has a native version, after some audio issues, I joined a casual match and was greeted by this.
Didn't even had a recording app, (no ""obs"" in aur) so wipped out my phone.
The network was fine seeing that I installed the game in about 2hrs, (30mbits) 22ping, maybe the shaders were off? idk, I was in windowed fullscreen running 1920x1080. Medium to low settings no far.

Played 2-3 rounds just to confirm and then disconnected (I don't want to be banned) but during them either 
1. the smoke vanished
2. turned solid grey
3. Solid grey with smoke texture from other smoke visible.

 \- Added Overwatch system to enable match demo review by trusted partners


Edit: been reading some of the comments and just wanted to share my thoughts.

This is a *huge* success for the _community_. At the end of the day, whether directly or indirectly, I’d like to think our community drove this change. Not any particular page or person. But everyone complaining and posting about the state of the game.

This does not fix the cheating problem. In fact, ironically, this update crashed FaceIt among other things last night. But this does give us a small amount of power back. When you lose to some walling, spinning, magic bulleting mother fucker. At least you can take solace in thinking maybe they’ll get overwatch banned instead of measly reporting them for griefing hoping everyone else does the same so _maybe_ they’ll get a 30 min ban or play with a bunch of other pieces of shit.

* The shitty lag compensation which teleport you when you getting tagged ( [proof](https://streamable.com/66nyzr) )
* The insane peekers advantage and no brain ADAD running and gunning SMGs silvers which are ridiculously OP compared to GO. Like the running accuracy of SMG actually is more increased in CS2 but same time the spraying with rifles got worse...The buff of idiots and nerf of Veterans players who mastered the spray to further reduce the skill gaps
* The 60 hz feel when you have 300 FPS
* The pathetic new sounds of AK which makes me wanna puke . It was my favourite gun in CSGO but now I just want to mute the gun when I shoot.
* the  character model movement animations which is wobbbly and bending like it's made of rubber.

I have 4k hours on steam over multiple accounts, 20k rating and i was at one point lvl10 FACEIT, i've also been playing 1.6 and Source since the internet cafe days so I think I can safely spit out an educated opinion about CS2:

**The game really feels worse than both 1.6 and Source and** ***cannot even be compared to 128tick CSGO***  
The amount of rubberbanding, sluggish inputs, shots, movement etc is honestly insane.  
**At a core level, CS2 feels and functions worse than all other CS titles.**  
There's purely no excuse for this, it's been a whole ass year since this turd dropped and other than ""fixing a gap in geometry"" VALVe does not want to acknowledge the fact that **SubTick FAILED** as a networking system.  
It's inconsistent between players with different pings, its worse than 64tick CSGO and cannot even be compared with 128tick

They removed 128tick completely making FACEIT unable to run 128tick servers yet their anticheat is so fcking bad FACEIT is basically REQUIRED to play this game cheater-free.

Why is every update giving us worse performance? Why hasn't there been any optimization update?  
Let's stop crying about optimization since nobody cares about that in 2024 lets be happy this game runs at 60fps  
Do you as a player even like where CS2 is going? Data miners literally found CHICKEN INSPECT ANIMATIONS like this gotta be the most stupid thing they add to CS at what point does this game stop being a competitive shooter and becomes just a cosmetic cash-cow that VALVe just milks until it drops dead?

They couldn't give less of a fck about hackers and bots in TF2, a very popular FPS title which is STILL in the top10 steam player counts literally every month  
They don't give a fuck about optimization, networking or anti-cheat for that matter, they don't give af about the custom servers or custom communities, it looks like they only give a fck about skinvestors or people like ohnepixel who scream at sticker prices for a living

After a full year of CS2 literally nothing changed from the buggy beta. We're still missing more than 60% of the CSGO content, the game still performs worse, 128tick has become a valorant thing only (what a joke), the ranks are a pure joke and realistically speaking every game after 15k rating has at least 1 cheater in it but now we can customize our chickens

It's so sad to see a game lose its track and soul so hard and coming from VALVe of all companies, it feels like a stab in the heart, but yeah im sure their new 3rd person DOTA-like hero-shooter will hit the market with critical acclaims

I feel like an old fart talking about how ""back in my day it used to be good"" but its just really really sad seeing everything unfold like this and i want y'all's opinion aswell hopefully i'm not the only one in this situation

Hello,



I fell prey to a sophisticated phishing scam. As someone quite careful with 2FA enabled, this scam really surprised me.



I'm sharing this because I want to both alert other people, as well as hopefully, though it's a long shot, have Valve make improvements to their policy and security.



I Google'd ""dmarket"", and navigated to what seemed like ""dmarket.com"". Somehow, Google messed up, and the link referenced in their search results (the top sponsored ad) is not the link to DMarket. (note that I and several others have reported that ad, so it might not show up anymore)



I operated on the false assumption that if Google says it's ""dmarket.com"", it is actually ""dmarket.com"". This is a fail on Google's end as far as I'm concerned.





Once on their site, the URL is not dmarket. However, due to a slip in attention, I missed this.



https://preview.redd.it/yp156iew1jyc1.jpg?width=1029&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c78250b61f731985c2e2ec75e08b22b70a802ba9



Once signed in on the site, the scammer will trade out your entire inventory after 2 days (since as part of the signing process, they have to reset the authenticator).





https://preview.redd.it/2vor6odx1jyc1.jpg?width=947&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9b1b16b5b3daf772f6ad838a8e29dbb5f539ef64

https://preview.redd.it/mobsmndx1jyc1.jpg?width=947&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a0eb3be207df75912aba77d6df09ac18c82aeb32

I understand I fell prey to a phishing scam and that to a large degree this is my fault. I get that.



However, I find it completely unacceptable that:



\* Steam Support will not return my $15,000 worth of items, even though they have not traded hands. They're still sitting in this person's inventory if you look at the number of items ( \[https://steamcommunity.com/id/zlatadegtyarev12\](https://steamcommunity.com/id/zlatadegtyarev12) ). Their policy states that they won't return them because they have changed hands multiple times, but this is clearly not applicable here.



This is a hack as clear as day. They can tell someone from a different device signed in and traded everything I had away.



However, I have no way of talking on the phone to a real person from Steam. I have to open a support ticket and wait 8 hours, only for them to reference the policy and close it. This is terrible.



\* Banks flag suspicious activity and lock your account. How is it not suspicious that someone from a new device that I don't play on sent away all my items worth $15,000? Why not flag it as suspicious and lock my account?

\* I never intended to trade my items away since I'm not a trader. I was simply enjoying them for myself. Why can't I trade lock my items, so that if I want to trade, I need to wait 14 days to do so? It would prevent this from happening.

\* Surely 2FA security can be improved? I understand I gave my confirmation code during the sign-in process on that phishing website which mirrors Steam. However, I was under the impression that I would still be asked to approve the trade if I had 2FA. The fact that this was so easy to phish for surprised me.

\* As a long-time CS player (20+ years), I really wanted a Dragon Lore. I can't get a Dragon Lore unless I step out of Valve's ecosystem. I only did it because I had to.

\* Even if they did trade hands, and even if I mistakenly gave my login information to someone who was able to trick Google, those should still legally be my items. If a thief steals your car because you were a fool, the police will chase,



Thank you for listening. I hope this post will help others, and I wish Valve could care more about its customers.",480,259,1714879755,Negative,0.819,surprise,0.534

1ft0uqz,dota2,Playing Dota is the most disrespectful thing I do to myself,"This isn't a complaint or a brag thread, it's just some musings I had the other day.

I have a PhD. In my 9-5, I work with other PhDs, lawyers, and economists. Everyone has a law degree or Master's, minimum. We all treat each other with respect and work on complex legal and economic issues around the world.

In my daily life I have a loving, supportive, and brilliant partner. My friends give me hugs and (sometimes) kisses when they see me. All things considered (""all things"" being the state of the world in general), I am much better off than most, economically and socially and romantically.

And then I hop into Dota. I queue up, have to contend with my lane partner fighting for last hits or just AFKing in jungle, and then get called a ""fucking idiot"" or ""learn to look at minimap kid"", all while probably being old enough to be their dad.

Playing Dota is the dumbest, most disrespectful thing I can do for myself.

Considering how long Dota has been around and how old some of us might be, who else can relate?

Edit: small note here to say WOW. Didn't expect this level of engagement when I posted from the toilet. Impossible for me to respond to everything but I really enjoyed reading through all the responses. As with Dota, the types of people who love Dota enough to visit a forum and comment are as varied as you can imagine: lots of people who relate, the chill individuals who just want to mute-all and play, and then of course a small amount of individuals who misinterpreted or assumed things that were never said and went off. But just as I open myself up to being insulted everytime I launch Dota, so too did I expect that posting on apublic forum.

My writing maybe wasn't clean, and many of you understood my meaning, but it really was all about how playing Dota subjects us to very different environments than what we experience or subject ourselves to in our daily life. But ultimately, it's an absolutely brilliant game, regardless of our skill level or time investment or willingness to communicate with each other as we would face-to-face. I hope to still continue to enjoy it here and there over the years to come (whether playing or just watching the pro scene), and I hope you all do, too.

1fj3wgb,dota2,TI13 is the worst TI I've attended in person,"I've attended four TIs in person (TI6, TI8, TI12), and TI13 (TI2024) is undoubtedly the worst one. The production quality has dropped to a level where even a major from a few years ago was far superior to this year’s TI.

* In the Arena

While the arena itself is decent, the setup felt cheap — there were very limited food options, the gift shop was incredibly shabby, and the activity area was minimal. Honestly, it felt no better than attending a local concert. This was even more disappointing when compared to previous years I attended TI.

* No Free Gift Bags

This is the only TI where there were no free gift bags. All we received upon entering the arena was a ticket card and a small pin. That’s it.

* Cheap Opening Ceremony

Seriously? The opening ceremony was just a pre-recorded video. I couldn’t believe it.

* No Fun In-Between Activities

While Slack and Tsunami did a good job, their performances were about the only thing that deserved any praise. There were no other fun activities in between the games, leaving fans with little to do during breaks.

* Worst Cosplay Competition

The cosplay competition was so short that a friend who went to the bathroom missed the whole thing by the time he came back.

* No Player Interviews or Vlogs

In previous TIs, we were treated to player interviews, replays, fun games, and vlogs that gave us glimpses into the players' lives between matches. This year? Nothing. It felt empty and lacking.

* The Most Expensive TI, Yet the Worst Experience

To make matters worse, all of this ""worst of all time"" experience came at the highest ticket price of all time. It feels like the golden age of TI is over, and Valve has clearly given up on improving the professional Dota 2 scene.",2868,494,1726590966,Negative,0.882,disgust,0.96

In my lowest moments, I found myself returning to DotA 2, a ""dead game"" in the eyes of many, but for me, it became an escape. Each match, each victory, and even the defeats brought a fleeting sense of purpose and relief. The familiar chaos of the game drowned out the chaos within me.

The dopamine rush from every ranked match helped me silence the echoes of pain and longing. In a strange way, this community became an unexpected comfort during these dark times.

Thank you, DotA 2 community, for unknowingly helping me find a sliver of solace in the storm. Stay toxic, boys. Sometimes, it’s exactly what we need.",2753,236,1734639301,Neutral,0.476,sadness,0.966

1fheooz,dota2,My Vengeful Spirit Arcana cosplay for TI13,"Hi!! Im Vicky_kujikawa (twitter, instagram, tiktok) and I wanted to share the cosplay I have spent the past 3 months of my life fully working on.

The set is the arcana + Vision of the Seraph Scion.

It has more than 1000 unique feathers patterned and made out of eva foam, wings can be opened (idk if they captured that on stage) and both the wings and weapon have lights.

Im very sad the light on the stage was so bad because none of the lighting effects could be properly seen :( I wish it was darker. I also think the colours didnt look as pretty because of the lights again.

Im also wearing some heelless shoes to recreate her birs feet.

The fact that the arcana got released so late made me lose my sanity to complete this in time.

If anyone wants to check how I made evetthing and some close ups you can do it on my social media as I have uploaded everything there.

And of course if you like my work would aporeciate any kind of share or folloe. I have also cosplayed Death Prophet years ago (and Im very proud of that cosplay and photos!)

1guh9tq,dota2,I recently talked to a girl about Dota 2,"Recently, I talked to a girl about Dota 2 at a posh restaurant, it did not go well.

She straight up asked me:

""Hey, what hero do you play the most?""

Upon hearing this question, my heart tightened, I began to have an intense panic attack and almost choked. So I gave my response:

""Y'know, the poison guy?""

I could see it in her eyes, a small flash of excitement.

""Oh? Viper? I love Viper, he is my main!""

I immediately tried to explain. ""N-no-""

""Then Silencer?""

""Sorry, I-""

""? He's not bad.""

""Also no...""

At this point, my head was already buried in my chest. I dared not even lift my head up, I was already sweating bullets, and the atmosphere was so awkward my twitching feet could almost penetrate a hole through the marble flooring.

""You play Broodmother? Then I'd agree it's pretty hard to say that so openly."" Her expression was already that of astonishment.

In this day and age, those who would play Broodmother are few in number. Either they still cling to old glory and sometimes OD on copium, or they are deranged in the mind. Quite pitiful they are. I felt her empathetic gaze on my neck, it shook me intensely like the time I accidently bought the battle pass bundle. I felt my face fluster, my breath got heavy, and my head dazed. I tried my damned hardest to calm my quivering legs and clenched my teeth to say the words I was about to say next. This took the last of my strength:

""Not her either!""

These words were wilted when they came out of my mouth, it's no more audible than a needle falling to a dancefloor. Though, I promise this was the loudest that I could speak at that time. I looked up. Her expression changed completely. There was a brief moment of dreadful silence.

""Then.... what hero do you play? I thought the game only had these heroes?""

Every single word she spoke struck me like hammers nailing down the last few pegs of the coffin to my weak heart. I was awestruck, my soul rendered apart by the sharpness of her words. Then, I could hold it in no more. Along with my words, a few strong-willed yet aggrieved tears rolled out of the corner of my eye.

""Venomancer, I play Venomancer.""

When I uttered his name, the discussions around us stopped, leaving me to wallop in the silence between my occasional sniffles. Feeling the pitiful gaze from passersby around me, I felt like an orphan dragging their disabled body to beg for spare change on the streets of Dota. I held my face in my hands, I was too embarrassed to let anyone see my miserable state.

She turned to leave. At this point, tears already washed my face, I was on the floor, my two arms gripped on her ankles, and didn't dare let go. I was a clown to the people around me. The last words that I let out that day before being dragged out by the security and falling into unconsciousness were spoken at that very moment.

""So what if his damage is low? It's not like he's unplayable! He will be good in the future! The devs will buff him one day, I'm sure of it.""

**DISCLAIMER**: This is **not** a guide on how to play him, this is just a (hopefully) exhaustive list of interactions surrounding the bird man. 

_______________________________________
________________________________________

### *[Katana Stance]*

####**Echo Slash** (Q)

Slashes forward in the direction Kez is currently facing, slashing all enemies in the area twice for 70/80/90/100% of total damage each, plus 30/45/60/75 if the target is a hero

- Pierces evasion
- Skill has no targeting, immediately dashes forward once cast
- Second slash has a 1.2s delay
- Applies a 100% slow for 0.25s on each slash
- Creates 12 overlapping circular zones of 200 radius in front of Kez, spaced 200/3 units apart. The first circle's center is directly in front of Kez's starting position.  [credit [Iris_mus](https://www.reddit.com/user/Iris_mus)]
   - Thus the backward reach (range where units behind Kez can be affected) is 200/3 + 200/3 = 133 units [credit [Iris_mus](https://www.reddit.com/user/Iris_mus)]
   - Although ""cast range"" is 800, can affect units up to 1000 units away
   - Cannot attack wards.
   - Destroys trees in the slash area.
- **Damage**: Physical*, so damage can be affected by ethereal form, physical barrier and armor.
   - *Affected* by damage block (Vanguard, Crimson Guard)
   - *Affected* by attack damage reduction (Frost Shield, Bulwark)
   - *Affected* by damage return (Blademail, Spiked carapace)
- Kez also dashes forward 250 units, passing through terrain
   - Does not disjoint projectiles
   - Can be used to escape impassable terrain from hero abilities (Arena of Blood, Kinetic Field/Fence)
   - If timed correctly, can be used to override displacement spells (X Marks the Spot, Glimpse [credit [Psychological-Leg413](https://www.reddit.com/user/Psychological-Leg413)], Nether Strike)
      - Will still apply damage and additional effects, just not the repositioning
- If Kez's attack damage increases or decreases before the second slash (e.g Armlet toggling) the damage is updated accordingly
- **Cast range manipulation**: Aether lens (and similar items) will not increase slash range, and skills like Enfeeble and Warp Flare will not decrease it
- **AoE manipulation**: Bloodstone will not increase slash width/AoE
- **Stun**: Will still slash even if Kez is stunned
- **Root**: Can be cast while rooted, but will not dash forward
   - Still slashes units up to 1000 units away
- **Leash**: Can be cast while leashed
   - Can be used to escape from Pounce, Soulbind and Sprout (Level 20)
- **Disarm**: Can still be casted and apply damage even if Kez is disarmed or in ethereal form.
- **Lifesteal**: Yes
- **Spell Lifesteal**: No
- **Spell Amplification**: No, seems it's only visual
- **Dispel**: The slow can be removed via basic dispel.
- **Debuff Immunity**: The damage will still apply, but will not slow
- **Courier**: Can damage couriers [credit [etrimmer](https://www.reddit.com/user/etrimmer) and [GGero](https://www.reddit.com/user/GGero)]

###### Ability Interactions:
   - **Kazurai Katana**: Each slash will add katana stacks
   - **Falcon Rush** [Sai]: a secondary attack will be performed on all affected targets from both slashes. But if the target is 575 range away from Kez (melee buffer range) the Falcon Rush attack will miss.
   - **Mark** [Sai]: Fully applies the critical damage and stun

###### Item Interactions:
   - **Critical Strike**: Yes
   - **Armor reduction**: Yes
   - **Cleave**: Yes
   - **Pierce** (from Javelin, Monkey King Bar): Yes
   - **Mage Slayer**: Yes
   - **Soul Rend** (from Bloodthorn): Yes
   - **Mana burn** (from Diffusal Blade, Disperser): burns the full amount of mana on each slash
   - **Skull Basher**: only 1 unit will be affected due to internal cooldown (2.3s)
   - **Witch Blade**: the *closest* unit will be affected
   - **Echo Saber**: applies the slow on all units (although a bit redundant), does not put it on cooldown
   - **Chain Lightning** (from Maelstrom, Mjollnir, Gleipnir): only 1 unit will be affected due to internal cooldown (0.2s)
   - **\*Revenant's Brooch**: Damage dealt becomes magical, and costs no additional mana (although it can't crit)
   - **Silver Edge**: if used after casting Echo Slash, the bonus damage and break will apply to the closest target in front of Kez. If this happens, Kez breaks invisibility.


###### Neutral Item Interactions
   - **Hound** (from Lance of Pursuit): Yes
   - **Magic Amp** (from Grove Bow) and **Magic Corruption** (from Parasma): Yes
   - **Afterburn** (from Dragon Scale): Yes
   - **Glassify** (from Nemesis Curse): the *farthest* unit will be affected
   - **Silence Strike** (from Mind Breaker): the *closest* unit will be affected
   - **Certain Strike** (from Enchanted Quiver): the *closest* unit will be affected

________________

#### **Grappling Claw** (W)

Grapples onto an enemy unit or tree. If the target is an enemy, it is slowed by 80% until it finishes. After which, Kez attacks the unit with 100% lifesteal. If it is a hero, Kez heals for 50/100/150/200 health.

- Cast range: 700/800/900/1000
- Pierces evasion
- **Damage**: Physical*, so damage can be affected by ethereal form, physical barrier and armor.
   - *Affected* by damage block (Vanguard, Crimson Guard)
   - *Affected* by attack damage reduction (Frost Shield, Bulwark)
   - *Affected* by damage return (Blademail, Spiked carapace)
- Unit (or tree) targeted
   - Does not destroy trees along the grappling path, only destroys the tree Kez lands on. [credit [The_Fritzle](https://www.reddit.com/user/The_Fritzle)]
- Can be interrupted via forced movement (e.g. Blinding Light, Flamebreak)
- Can be used to escape some impassable terrain from hero abilities (Fissure, Kinetic Field/Fence)
   - Cannot be used to escape Arena of Blood, but can be used to go *in* the arena
- Can be disjointed if target blinks or becomes hidden before the claw latches. If done successfully, Kez will not travel and the spell is put on cooldown.
   - If target blinks after the claw latches, the damage is still applied but Kez will not follow the target and will just grapple to the original destination.
   - If target is hidden after the claw latches, Kez will travel to the target but will not deal damage.
- **Spell Block** (from Linken's Sphere): will proc when the claw latches and Kez will not travel. Will not proc if disjointed.
- **Echo Shell** (from Lotus Orb): target will also cast Grappling Claw on Kez after latching. They end up in a spot in between but closer to the target (due to the delay in casting).
   - If target blinks after latching while having spell block and echo shell, Kez will stay in place, and the target will blink to their destination before grappling to Kez.
- **Cast range manipulation**: Aether lens (and similar items) will increase cast range, and skills like Enfeeble and Warp Flare will decrease it
   - Bloodstone has no effect
- **Stun**: Will still latch, travel and attack the target even if Kez is stunned
- **Root/Leash**: Cannot be cast while rooted or leashed
- **Disarm**: Can still be casted and apply damage even if Kez is disarmed or in ethereal form.
- **Lifesteal**: Yes
- **Spell Lifesteal**: No
- **Spell Amplification**: No
- **Dispel**: The slow can be removed via basic dispel.
- **Debuff Immunity**: The damage will still apply, but will not slow.


###### Ability Interactions:
   - **Kazurai Katana**: The lifesteal attack will add katana stacks
   - **Falcon Rush** [Sai]: a secondary attack will occur if Kez successfully arrives to the target (not interrupted), will not lifesteal
   - **Mark** [Sai]: will fully crit and stun if the attack lands
      - Additionally, if Kez switches to Sai before latching to the target, the succeeding attack can mark (17%)

###### Item Interactions:
   - **Critical Strike**: Yes
   - **Armor reduction**: Yes
   - **Cleave**: Yes
   - **Pierce** (from Javelin, Monkey King Bar): Yes
   - **Chain Lightning** (from Maelstrom, Mjollnir, Gleipnir): Yes
   - **Empower Spell** (from Phylactery, Khanda): Yes
   - **Mage Slayer**: Yes
   - **Soul Rend** (from Bloodthorn): Yes
   - **Mana burn** (from Diffusal Blade, Disperser): Yes
   - **Skull Basher**: Yes
   - **Witch Blade**: Yes
   - **Echo Saber**: applies the slow on arrival and does not put it on cooldown
   - **\*Revenant's Brooch**: Still does not cost mana, and can't crit
      - It will still heal Kez (via lifesteal, not spell lifesteal)

###### Neutral Item Interactions
   - **Hound** (from Lance of Pursuit): Yes
   - **Magic Amp** (from Grove Bow) and **Magic Corruption** (from Parasma): Yes
   - **Afterburn** (from Dragon Scale): Yes
   - **Glassify** (from Nemesis Curse): Yes
   - **Silence Strike** (from Mind Breaker): Yes
   - **Certain Strike** (from Enchanted Quiver): Yes

_______________________

#### **Kazurai Katana** (E)

Katana normal attacks and abilities deal a stacking damage over time and applies 20/25/30/35% regen reduction.

- *Only* affects HP regeneration, does not reduce healing or lifesteal.
- Damage calculation is as follows:
   1. Whenever Kez deals damage from his katana attacks/abilities, target gains stacks equal to 35/48/63/80% of the damage dealt **before reductions**.
      - Does not add stacks from proc damage (chain lightning, mana burn, etc.)
      - 1 stack will deal 1 additional damage (if the target gains 500 stacks, spell will deal 500 damage before reductions over its duration)
   2.  After 1 second, apply 1/n of the damage (where n is 5/6/7/8) once per second over n seconds
      - Reduce stacks by damage dealt
   3. If new katana damage is applied to the target, go back to (1) and duration is refreshed
      - Example: Kez deals 1000 attack damage to target, level 4 Katana will give 800 stacks, then deal 800/8 (100) damage per second for 8 seconds. After 1 second, 100 damage is dealt, 100 stacks is consumed. Then, if Kez deals 100 more damage, Katana will give 80 stacks, totaling 780 damage. Katana will now deal 780/8 (97.5) damage per second over 8 seconds. 
- **Damage**: Physical*, so damage can be affected by ethereal form, physical barrier and armor.
   - *Not affected* by damage block (Vanguard, Crimson Guard).
   - *Not affected* by attack damage reduction (Frost Shield, Bulwark)
   - *Affected* by damage return (Blademail, Spiked carapace).
- **Lifesteal**: No
- **Spell Lifesteal**: Yes
- **Spell Amplification**: Yes

### *[Sai Stance]*

#### **Falcon Rush** (Q)

For 7 (+2 with talent) seconds, Kez has phased movement and can rush to targets within 600 range, at 1000 speed. Whenever Kez attacks, an untargetable afterimage of Kez will attack a second time.

- During Falcon Rush, Sai has a BAT of 1.2/1.1/1/0.9 while Katana has a BAT of 1.3/1.2/1.1/1
   - Attack interval calculation: `BAT - AttackSpeed*AttackSpeedFactor/100` where `AttackSpeedFactor = 6/7/8/9%`.
   - At 700 Attack Speed, Max Level Attack Interval is `0.9-(700*0.09/100)=0.27s` in Sai and `1 -(700*0.09/100)=0.37s` in Katana.
- While rushing, Kez cannot be slowed.
- Secondary attacks can miss through evasion or when the second attack hits, Kez and the target is father than the melee buffer range (575 in Katana and 500 in Sai) [credit [Blueye95](https://www.reddit.com/user/Blueye95) [tekkeX_](https://www.reddit.com/user/tekkeX_) [SleepyDG](https://www.reddit.com/user/SleepyDG)]
-  **Damage**: Physical*, so damage can be affected by ethereal form, physical barrier and armor.
   - *Affected* by damage block (Vanguard, Crimson Guard).
   - *Affected* by attack damage reduction (Frost Shield, Bulwark)
   - *Affected* by damage return (Blademail, Spiked carapace).
- **Lifesteal**: Afterimage attack can lifesteal
- **Spell Lifesteal**: No
- **Spell Amplification**: No
- **Illusions**: Illusions do not have the secondary attack nor the rush.
- **Dispel**: Falcon Rush can be dispelled.
- **Debuff Immunity**: Fully affects units with debuff immunity
- **Courier**: The afterimage can attack the courier (Only plausible with Marci on enemy team)

###### Ability Interactions:
   - **Echo Slash** [Katana]: a secondary attack will be performed on all affected targets from both slashes. But if the target is 575 range away from Kez (melee buffer range) the Falcon Rush attack will miss.
   - **Grappling Claw** [Katana]: a secondary attack will occur if Kez successfully arrives to the target (not interrupted), will not lifesteal
   - **Kazurai Katana** [Katana]: the secondary attack can apply katana stacks only if the first attack was from a katana
   - **Raptor Dance** [Katana]: Does not proc secondary attacks but can still rush while slashing
   - **Talon Toss**  [Sai]: N/A
   - **Mark** [Sai]: The secondary attack can mark the target (17%) or proc it if it is already marked. Fully applies crit and stun.
   - **Raven's Veil**  [Sai]: N/A

      -All succeeding marked attacks pierce evasion since the attack always has True Strike [credit [heartfullofpains](https://www.reddit.com/user/heartfullofpains)]
   - **Cleave**: Although the attack does not deal damage to Kez while parrying, it can fully cleave (and deal damage).
      - Marci with Battle Fury may not deal damage to Kez during Unleash, but will kill everyone behind him
   - **Damage Return**: Successful parries can be returned (blademail)

#### **Raven's Veil** (R)

Kez releases a wave of smoke in a 1500 radius that temporarily reduces vision from enemies and applies a Parry Mark. Kez turns invisible for 7/8/9 seconds, with 15/25/35% bonus movement speed.

- Applies a basic dispel on cast and can dodge projectiles if no true sight

- The applied Parry Mark overrides any previously applied Mark/Parry Mark, with refreshed duration.
- **AoE manipulation**: Bloodstone increases AoE to 1575
- **Stun**: wave will still travel and apply Parry Mark even if Kez is stunned
- **Root**: Can be cast while rooted

- **Dispel**: The vision reduction can be removed via basic dispel but the parry mark can only be removed via strong dispel.
- **Debuff Immunity**: Applies Parry Mark on debuff immune targets but not the vision reduction.

__________________________________

###### Morphling
- Upon casting Morph, Morphling will copy the skillset of the currently active stance.
- Katana Stance
   - Echo Slash
      - Functions the same as with Kez, but the after image is Morphling.
   - Kazurai Katana
      - Only applies stacks while morphed into Kez
- Sai Stance

      - While morphed as Kez, Mophling has secondary attacks. 
      - When morphed out, Morphling can rush but cannot use secondary attacks.

###TLDR I just want to know something interesting

The following is already from above but if you don't have the time to read everything, here are some of the more interesting interactions I've found (in my opinion) while testing:

- **Echo Slash** (Q): Can be used to escape leashes (Pounce, Sprout), displacement (Glimpse, X Mark) and impassable terrain (Kinetic Field, Arena of Blood)
- **Grappling Claw** (W): Can be used to escape Kinetic Field, and go in Arena of Blood (but not out)
- **Kazurai Katana** (E): If the target has attack damage reduction (Bulwark, Frost Shield), it might not be a good idea to cast the active because it will be reduced. Rather, let it tick
- **Shodo Sai** (E): Cleave is the only item-based attack modifier that works during parry. For hero-based modifiers, results may vary
- **Ghost Scepter**: Perhaps the best early defensive item against Kez. Can dodge all of his abilities (even Raptor's Dance) except Talon Toss.
- **Revenant's Brooch**: Since most of Kez's abilities are attack based, Revenant's Brooch costs no mana. Also, when attacking marked enemies with revenant's brooch, you consume no mana, and do not proc the mark (might be a bug?)

1hjgw09,dota2,Your steam account should be paired with your Linkedin before you can play ranked,"Hello fellow dota gamers,

My suggestion to icefrog is that you must pair a steam account with a real linkedin before you can queue ranked.

This will being the following benifits:
 
* Improve the quality of game communication with players knowing their employer could see the language they use in a video game
* Allow others to see who has a stressful job, perhaps knowing that players could be more understanding of each other!
* Allow like minded players to professionally connect with each other. If they can succeed together in a game of dota who knows what they can achieve in the world of busniess!

This is why I think it would be a great idea, hopefully someone at valve reads this and makes this happen!

1dyf3ib,dota2,The rest of Magnus needs to be reversed,"Magnus’s reverse reverse polarity talent just reverses his ult. Why is just his ult reversed? I say everything else about Magnus needs to be reversed to match. 

Regular Magnus is a *male*, *melee* hero with *cleave* and an ult that *pulls enemies close*.

What happens when you reverse this? A reversed Magnus?

Magna should be a *female*, *ranged* hero with a *split shot* and an ult that *pushes enemies away*.

Theory crafters and pros have reached a consensus that reverse reverse polarity is a meme. They try to say it doesnt fit the rest of his kit, is situational, blah blah blah nerd crap. The real reason is simpler, its because they reversed just one part of his kit without transitioning the rest. Gender confusion. Thats why its weird.

This is consistent with the lore too. Sven is a man that cleaves. Dusa is a woman that split shots. Most men are melee, see CK, Ursa, Bloodseeker. Most women are ranged, see Lina, CM, Windranger, Dark Willow. And TA has melee sized range along with a “cleave” and we all know what that means. 

Magna’s new combo would be to empower a female ranged carry with split shot, and use reverse reverse polarity to push creepy old men like kotl and gyro away from her while she split shots them down. maybe even use shockwave to slow her enemies as they run at her idk.

1havwdk,dota2,My wife was upset I didn't abandon my game for her tonight. AITA?,"This shit always happens. She knows that I can't pause Dota games, like she hasn't learned that after the past 6,000 hours of my playtime. She always has something for me to do even when I'm CLEARLY having me time right now.

This time was especially irritating though because I was running the risk of losing my rank. The map was in a yin-yang like position with our bottom barracks down and their top barracks down. It was one of those games where one fight will decide the match. I pop smoke and ping for everyone to move in on dire triangle from the south, and like clockwork my wife busts open the door and demands my attention.

She's pregnant and swears she's going into labor, but I did the research. She's way to early for that to be possible, being like 8 months and 11 weeks. I don't even bother to look at her since I know she's lying as I capture the outpost. 

She then had the audacity to stamp her fist on my desk like a judge or something, crying about how ""I'm not supportive of her"" and that ""our child is about to enter the world"" and that i need to drive her. I throw my keys at her chest and tell her to drive herself since I know she's full of shit. 

Before I knew it, just before I was able to cast Chain Frost, my screen goes black. She hit the power button. I tell her to get the hell out of my room and she leaves the basement limping up the stairs to have my mom drive her to the hospital. 

Needless to say, I lost the match and the result was me landing in Guardian III and a leaver penalty. I'm gonna give her a peace of my mind when she gets back. ",1915,252,1733813250,Negative,0.922,anger,0.568

1hezb2m,dota2,My Farewell to dota 2. As a player for 20 years ,"Hello, everyone. I’m Kiks, and I’ve been playing this game for two decades, ever since I was five years old. This game has been incredibly special to me, but the time has come to say goodbye to my favorite game of all time.

As of December 16, 2024, I’ve finally achieved my goal of hitting 7k MMR again after a two-year hiatus from 2018 to 2020. I started playing again during the pandemic, and it’s been quite the journey.

I’ve been a semi-professional player, competing in local tournaments as a teenager. But now, as I approach my 30s, it’s time to say farewell to the game that brought me so much joy and sorrow.

This Dota isn’t the same game I started playing when I was five—it has evolved. The ever-changing tides of the meta, bringing a breath of fresh air every six months, have kept the player base engaged for so long. I’m glad the game continues to bring enjoyment (and sometimes frustration) to so many people.

I’ll always treasure the endless nights spent in net cafes with my friends, the long walks we took just to join tournaments, and the days when we were all just kids trying to have fun. Those memories will stay with me forever.

However, my passion and love for this game have gradually waned over the years. We’re no longer in our teens; we can’t play for 18 hours straight anymore. Most of us now have families, jobs, and kids. It’s time to move on and begin a new chapter in life.

Once again, thank you, Dota, for 20 incredible years. Signing out,  
Kiks

BZM was NOT allousing his keyboard, he played only with a mouse. If you beat him you get random OG merchandise.

I got very excited and decided to try out and see what's gonna happen. How do you lose to a guy playing with one hand right?

I play mid only, and I currently sit at 5.2k MMR with my peak being 5.7k. I watched BZM Vs the guys before me, he was literally crushing them. However I noticed that they play matches like Lina Vs Lina or Necro Vs Necro which seemed very easy for him as they require little keyboard interaction. So I decided to play lone druid, since it requires micro and I got 600 games with LD with about 65% winrate.

Well I got beaten:D first two waves I got some creep advantage, killed his ward then he started playing seriously. The creeps went equal, I started abusing the micro, I was splitting the druid and the bear to get better trades. Finally I committed and killed his bear thinking ""yes Im winning now"" however I was out of position when I killed the bear, he resummoned I got entangled and I lost.

What can I say, pro players are just light years ahead of us.

1fn5pae,dota2,Cloud9 disbanded 7 hours after the announcement,"“We won't play in the qualifier with this line-up. Most likely we will not even play in this qualifier.

This line-up didn't leave the paper unfortunately. And it's no use blaming Cloud 9.

Some words that could not be put in contract on a Sunday that was the maximum deadline of the line-up and with that the line-up ended up not closing due to a last minute withdrawal. (We were going to sign on Monday) As I said in the audio. This shuffle is surreal. Stress at the limit. I've never felt so stressed with dota.

It's kind of absurd to have 7 days to close a line up from the end of the TI, which in theory should be the rest period.

I hope this will change in the coming years. Maybe they make an association of teams in dota like they have in CS so it's not this calendar mess.

Inhuman stress in this shuffle, the TI afterparty wasn't even a party anymore, it was negotiation stress with clock pressure running against, and it's not just for me. I heard many players complain.”

I walked up behind him and went"" dota huh? I love that game"" - still only seeing the loading screen as the greem accept button appeared. ""Turbo huh?"" 

As he was gathering hope i shut his laptop 🤣

1dfaw3x,dota2,Don't waste ur life grinding mmr if u dont plan to go pro,"Basically title, Ive been playing this game for many years, since the first TI. During my highschool/college days ive grinded my ass to get mmr, around 5k mmr when the mmr system was introduced and then later to around 7k when the medals became a thing. The point im trying to make is that I regret that deeply for all the time lost grinding that shit. Im not saying playing dota is a waste of time, it can be something fun if u play with friends, which for the past year ive managed to do. So for all the dota enjoyers out there, that play solo day and night grinding virtual points, from a man who regrets that with all his heart, is not worth it. Nobody will care, nobody will notice you having a medal. Now, I understand that it may seem like some sort of status to have a good medal, but in reality it doesnt. Grinding MMR became a lottery. You have to understand that some games are just not winnable because people refuse to play, in a team game. Considering this factor which u have no control over, at the end of the day u're just simulating a casino.   
Play the game to enjoy it, for me it became the factor that dictated my life in the past, I ve used to not do my shit just to grind this game, so for all the people out there struggling with this, I hope this message will get to you.  Dota is an amazing game, and im sure there are ppl who enjoy playing rank to a somewhat casual/fun level but from all the people I 've talked to its just a fountain of rage and anger which transfers over to other things in your life, relationships etc.

Maybe pro teams know more than us, but if not then they don't know what format to expect or what they are playing for. The people going to TI doesn't know what teams they will see, because only top 8 will play on stage. And most likely there's no true sight this year either.

""I will write about the reasons for going on long leave. too much workload and maximum dedication, which was not followed by receiving results throughout the year, made me think that I will not be able to have the same fire in my eyes in the new season, which will have even more tournaments than this one, as I had before. I am aware to myself and the team that I did not leave for good, but to take a break from professional Dota, I will return, this is undeniable, Working in the same team for several years takes its toll, you can't approach working with people you know so much so impartially, and one way or another, if you live together for 3-4 years non-stop against your will, each person, roughly speaking, has their own negative residue, which, perhaps indirectly, affects the results. I will use this time that will be allocated to me to rest from professional Dota, I will continue to play Dota itself, perhaps I will turn on streams. All the best, I will post photos from my trips here, I want to go to the Champions and see what kind of tournaments there are in other disciplines, all the best😊

P.S. Don't send me offers, I'm not interested""

1gqu3ut,dota2,Watching Arcane Season 2 just makes me sad at what DotA could've been,"Dragon's Blood was a disjointed mess and incredibly meh. This year's TI was completely forgettable, in fact I did. Compare that to this year's Worlds where the production was off the charts. We're also seeing the same familiar faces every TI, Fly is 31 and still getting there. Valve can't even pony up the tiny budget it takes to run the Late Game show.

Crownfall was a great live service for us but Valve's attitude of 'letting the product speak for itself' isn't working in getting new players into the game. Calculating from the last 10 years worth of prize pools, Valve has received more than $500m in revenue from TI compendium/battlepass purchases alone, *with the prize pool calculated away*. Imagine a world where they actually took that money we spent in previous TI's and created an Emmy winning animated series and continued to invest in tournaments. I'm personally more than happy to spend $100 every year to support this.

If their staff is bored of Dota then at this point, they should spin off a completely new company to handle marketing and the DotA franchise whilst continuing to employ IceFrog and team if they're so worried about creative control. Let people who are eager to continue the legacy of DotA as the superior MOBA carry the torch.

EDIT: I'm also incredibly salty that Riot keeps copying everything Valve does but actually puts resources into it. Autochess? Teamfight Tactics. ARAM? Howling Abyss. Invoker? Hwei.

1ec0706,dota2,Crownfall has had the best cavern crawl systems in the game's history. ,"Compared to the previous event systems, everything seems incredibly doable and fun.

Previous cavern crawls made you play heroes and roles that you have no familiarity with, which leads to a kind of soft griefing in pubs. I couldn't tell you how many times I saw someone with a node that required a win with lets say Earth Spirit, they sucked ass, and in chat all they had to say was ""Cavern Crawl :)"". 

This is no longer an issue in Crownfall. 

All of the tokens have a good spread of characters across all the different roles. You may have to play heroes that you're unfamiliar with, but you'll always find a hero in your comfortable roles. It's a good balance of still learning new parts of the game, but not so much that you're getting thrown into conditions that make you a griefer.

I usually stick with Position 4 and 5. The blood token really only has a couple solid support choices. One of them is Dazzle so I learned Dazzle for Act 3 and I gotta say I'm adding him to my hero pool. The only token I really don't like is Tide. Only six heroes can get you a Tide token and none of them are supports.

I also really like the scrap system. It's easy to get most of the tokens because of what I said before, but accumulating scraps helps you deal with the tokens that you just couldn't be fucked to grind losses for

1en5sk9,dota2,"Average HP and magic res has doubled in the last 10 years, yet Dagon damage is 400 since Dota 1","Edit: Just to dispel the notion that this is a random take (and because nobody reads until the end), I'm a professional Dota coach and I've written a detailed post breaking down Dota's damage mechanics [here](https://buymeacoffee.com/slashstrike/dissecting-damage-dota-2-theory-vs-practice), and you can see my other work [here](https://buymeacoffee.com/slashstrike/posts) and [here](https://buymeacoffee.com/slashstrike)

Anybody who's been playing for a while can remember the days when most heroes needed late game farm to reach 2k HP, and reaching 3k HP was quite rare, something that only farmed strength cores could really achieve. In the mid game, it was quite normal to have around 1000-1500 HP.

Nowadays you can almost double those numbers - a core with less than 2k HP is squishy, 3k is standard and 4k is quite easily achievable if the game goes late enough. The new benchmark for unusually high HP, instead of 3000 like back in the day, would now be around 6000 (doable only by Centaur, Pudge, Undying, etc.)

On top of this, consider the fact that magic resistance was scarce and generally just 25% back then, and now having 50% by late game is completely standard.

And yet, the only %-based damage item in the game is Spirit Vessel, which is obviously not reliable late. Dagon has mostly been a joke item on 99% of heroes, and while you can argue for the utility of level 1 Dagon in terms of the spell lifesteal for QoP and Huskar, burst heal, etc., the 800 damage on Dagon 5 is a joke considering it's the most expensive item in the game at 7000+ gold. Think of how game-changing other expensive items feel, like Windwaker and Refresher, and now imagine that Dagon 5 is even more expensive. 

I believe it's time to add another % damage item, and Dagon seems perfect for it. The levels could go like 

1. 400 flat
2. 400 + 10% of current HP
3. 500 + 15% of current HP
4. 500 + 15% of max HP
5. 600 + 20% of max HP

Numbers should obviously be tweaked, but the general idea remains.

Speaking of damage, I've just written a [detailed post dissecting damage in dota with theoretical and practical parts that you can check out here.](https://buymeacoffee.com/slashstrike/dissecting-damage-dota-2-theory-vs-practice) Writing the post is what made me think about damage, damage resistance, HP etc. and how they've all evolved over the years, and how Dagon's damage has not.",1369,350,1723123211,Neutral,0.719,neutral,0.824

Mana increases by 2 mana per unit of time. Razor's first ability is Plasma Field. Razor emits a wave of plasma energy whose power increases as the wave travels further (but it has a limit on how far it can return) to deal damage to enemies in its path. The further away from Razor the wave is, the more damage it deals. To use this ability, Razor must spend 12 mana and it takes 16 units of time to be able to use this ability again.

Help Razor know when he can use Plasma Field with a notification signal instead of having to calculate the mana amount himself.

1) Dota is too time and energy-consuming to play competitve mode (ranked), too much stress involved

2) Winning doesn't make you much happy but contrary losing makes you very frustrated

3) Even with 12k behaviour/communication score people are very toxic in games

4) A lot of people don't communicate in games and considering the fact that Dota is now in the most teamplay-oriented state it makes games very frustrating

5) There are a lot more ""chill"" games out there compared to Dota

6) No big patch for a long time (5 months+) which makes the game more boring

Most of them are playing Path of Exile, HELLDIVERS, Warhammers or other single games. I feel like a fucking Dota fanatic among them. It's very sad tbh. To be clear - we all are about 25-30 y.o.

A Reason why I’ve thought Bastion is because he can do a Heavy burst of Damage before the Duplication Ends and is pretty Durable for Survival. 

Reaper is a Common Pick because the Value you can Get from his Ult and the Mobility he has.

Mercy could be a Good Pick because Revives and Boosting Teammates in Critical Situations when it’s Needed.

1evcu7t,overwatch,Why Is King’s Row So Loved?,"Whenever I ask someone what their favorite map is, they almost always bring up Kings Row. Kings Row is also one of my favorite maps. But why is it so loved?


Here are some explanations to why so many people love King’s Row.


1. The Aesthetics: Kings Row is set in London. The time of day is night and the whole scenery has a very good aesthetic. The map travels around alleyways, subway stations, hotels, and “The Underground,” a place where omnics live in the lore, which leads me to my next part.


2. The Lore: Kings Row is a map that has a lot of lore. The “Alive” cinematic took place in Kings Row, featuring both Tracer and Widowmaker. You can also see many propaganda posters against omnics on this map, which ties into the storyline.


3. The Gameplay: Kings Row has a pretty even mix of long sightlines and close quarters that allow many different heroes to be played. 
Ex. Widowmaker is very popular on this map, but so is Reinhardt.


4. The Mode: Kings Row is a hybrid map, which involves 1 capture point which then turns into an escort. In my experience, hybrid is the most well received game mode.


5. Original Map: Kings Row was an original map that came out with Overwatch 1’s release, making it a long time classic for many players which makes it somewhat nostalgic.



Are these reasons why Kings Row is so loved? Why do you think it’s a fan favorite? What is your favorite map? Let me know.",4510,534,1723997139,Positive,0.919,neutral,0.932

Plus, the voice lines are so cool, too. ""Doom approaches!"" ""Get out of my way!"" ""The hamster is coming for you."" ""Sublime lethality!""

Before any dev comes here and silently defend their decision in their heads, **NO**, it is **NOT** satisfying to grind prisms in the battle pass only for us to unlock a minor design change. Most of the players **do not** like it. Listen to the majority of your player base for once.

These kind of mythic skins feels like a scam because the final level should be the base mythic skin then you start the customizations from there, not make it a glorified upgradable legendary skin. They can't even be bothered to make a second weapon variant ffs. 

I just hope that the next mythic skins will stop following this trend..

1fy3tt0,overwatch,Ramattra is the best character concept to ever be added to the game and it isn't even a contest,"Alright, listen up, because clearly some of y’all just don’t get it. Ramattra is the best addition to Overwatch—it’s not even a debate. If you don’t think so, you either haven’t played him or you’re just bad. Yeah, I said it. You’re bad. 😏

https://preview.redd.it/v7ynu2em1btd1.png?width=396&format=png&auto=webp&s=906b0d3155295290d8341b9a0cccd23777395fbd

This dude isn’t some cookie-cutter hero. Nah, he’s on a whole different level. The second he drops into the game, you can feel it. It’s like everything shifts, and suddenly the match gets serious. 💥 All these other heroes? They’re still trying to flex with their skins or play the same tired strats, but Ramattra? He’s built different, man. It’s like he’s thinking ten steps ahead, while the rest of them are running around trying to figure out how to stop him. Spoiler: You can’t. 😎

https://preview.redd.it/4r4ltgmq1btd1.png?width=610&format=png&auto=webp&s=90a480607eb4c74876ad90c98f1988fca5120a37

Let’s start with the obvious—he’s got range AND close combat, and he switches between them like it’s nothing. Omnic form? Boom, you’re poking people from across the map, controlling the game like some kinda boss. But the second someone thinks they’re gonna rush you? BAM—Nemesis mode. 💪 And then it’s over. You’re just smashing them into the ground while they’re panicking because they have no idea what to do. He’s a tank, but not just some brick wall that soaks damage. He’s aggressive, like actually in-your-face aggressive, and the best part? He can protect his team while doing it. Yeah, wrap your head around that. 🤯

https://preview.redd.it/v2j4p82z1btd1.png?width=1800&format=png&auto=webp&s=708485b6735d04ec0ab3d70f467373756020e3b2

And don’t even get me started on the ult. It’s pure chaos. The minute you pop it, people scatter like roaches. 🪳 It’s like watching them scramble because they know there’s nothing they can do. You’re out here draining their life while just... existing near them. It’s not just a ""push this button, kill everything"" ult. No, no, you become death. People don’t even wanna be near you. It’s that crazy. Sometimes, I swear I can hear their thoughts, their fears echoing in the silence, and it drives me to madness. 😱

https://preview.redd.it/fx0d79n02btd1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=cce031ea139e4f177c6cc98a45c9a57288704e2f

But here’s what really makes him next-level: he has a purpose. You look at the other heroes, and what are they doing? Running around fighting for... what? Some vague idea of justice? Fame? Cool, I guess. But Ramattra? This dude’s fighting for his entire species, man. He’s trying to end oppression, trying to change the whole world. 🌍 He’s not messing around with this hero worship BS. He’s out here to win. And honestly? That makes him even more badass. He’s not some glory-seeker; he’s a freakin’ revolutionary. ✊

https://preview.redd.it/dyts64y52btd1.png?width=618&format=png&auto=webp&s=829b6c53ad9c35d901bb1db919730590d40e3f60

And the best part? He doesn’t care about your opinion. He’s not here for you to like him. He’s here to end you if you’re in the way. So if you think you’re gonna roll in with your Genji or your Reinhardt and outplay him, yeah, good luck with that. You’re gonna get deleted. 💥

Bottom line: if you don’t think Ramattra is the GOAT, you’re probably just not good enough to understand how to play him. Get good. Or better yet, just stay out of his way. He’s not here for your approval, and he sure as hell isn’t gonna stop for anyone. 🚫

Since the release of the My Hero Academia crossover event, some Chinese players have shown dissatisfaction when you purchase and use these skins. For some reason, they may deliberately throw the game by abandoning it and using abilities like ""Lifeweaver's Life Grip"" to pull you into enemy positions. This behavior has been observed not only in quick matches but also in ranked games.

As someone who just wants to enjoy the game, this situation feels confusing and frustrating as it significantly ruins the experience. I hope other players who've encountered similar issues will report them to the developers so they can address the problem. Thank you!",3521,492,1729422086,Negative,0.645,anger,0.703

If once both teams have reached the checkpoint, the bot took a shortcut back to the barriers, it would be much easier to make progress later on.

We have his cure, Healing Sprout, which is perfect for distances and for flying heroes since it is automatic direction, and why deny it, even if our partner has already hidden behind a wall, the cure reaches him anyway, service 4 ☆. 

It is no surprise to anyone that there is mockery with his shot, Salva Espinosa, because of how little damage it can do... how long it takes to arrive... etc etc etc. But from my experience, I can say that if you have a minimum of aim and know how to handle the shot, you scare any dps that tries to go after you face to face because they don't expect, not that a healer can do that damage, but that LifeWeaver be the one who does that damage. (3 ☆) 

Speaking of one of its abilities, our beloved Petaloid Platform, with its latest rework, the truth is that it has become something quite useful in games, especially if you have the advantage, snipers or long-distance heroes appreciate it a lot. Even a LifeWeaver pro can save you from many ultis with it, there is even a map to practice with different ultis. 
In case you didn't know, there is a neat trick with the platform to be able to upload more than it uploads on its own, look for it on Tiktok. (5 ☆) 

His other ability is Life Grip, as I said before, it is that sigh of “thank goodness” that anyone feels when they are saved by this ability. 
I am not going to deny that having a wall in the middle the skill can be scratched a little, or not work or take longer to attract a person. 
My advice is, never hide from your LifeWeaver ;D (4.5 ☆)

The passive, (not the character xd) Regenerator Pass, is quite useful for fleeing, keeping distance from a Reaper, driving an Ashe's aim crazy... 
A not very complex ability, similar to Hanzo's. (4 ☆)

And finally, his ultimate, Tree of Life, at the beginning of his release many people deduced that it would be an ultimate for fights, and they were not wrong, it is very good for fights but over time they saw that they were the perfect wall to stop enemies, skills, saving companions from sleeps, shatters + charges. 
My favorite use is to cut off the enemies' path or reduce it so that they cannot enter since all our damage is reduced to that open area through which they can no longer pass. 
(4.5 ☆)

I think that at the end of the day I have shown the best pros of our beloved Thai healer who is a fan of Jojo's.

1epuoup,overwatch,My Dad just passed and I will honor him with Mauga...,"My dad has been in the hospital since March. He has a congenital heart defect that finally caught up with him at the age of 64. Back then, they estimated that he would only live to be about 30 years old. My dad was in a heart clinic, waiting for a donor heart. It took a while for him to get on the donor list, but once he did, things moved quickly. It only took a month and a half before we received the news that he was getting a new heart. We were overjoyed. Before the transplant, he called me and started with the sentence: ""This might be the last time we talk..."" That kind of sentence was typical for him; he never fully thought through what he sometimes said. In the last few weeks, he fought hard and slept a lot. He couldn't speak after the operation, but he looked at me when I visited him. In the last few days, his heart stopped more often, and they had to resuscitate him three times.

Tonight, I was playing a few ranked games with my girlfriend, and I was just one win away from finally being able to buy a jade weapon. The moment the match ended and I got the points for the weapon, the hospital called to tell me that my dad had passed away.

My dad loved action heroes. Sylvester Stallone, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson, Keanu Reeves, and a few others. After the call, my girlfriend asked if there was anything she could do for me, and I said, ""This might sound really dumb, but can you help me pick a hero to honor my dad with the jade weapon?"" She smiled and nodded. We are very sure that my dad would have liked Mauga the most out of all the heroes. A tough guy with two miniguns and cool one-liners? Yep, definitely.

The whole moment Overwatch's story was building up to was the reformation of Overwatch and the ensuing war with Null Sector, but now that's done, and about half the roster is still left with basically nothing to do aside from an occasional scuffle with some nameless goons in a tie in comic or whatever. 

So if they do ever decide to start moving the story again, what do you want the characters who aren't currently affiliated with Overwatch, Null Sector, or Talon to do? Would you want them to join one of those factions, join with eachother, form a new team, whatever. 

I tried sorting the characters into the different groups, Overwatch, Talon, and Null Sector for the first 3 slides. But the other 3 slides are all characters who aren't really a part of any of the important conflicts in the story. I might have made a few mistakes.

Continuing with this policy of banning everyone for everything said has been counterproductive for meeting weirdos and having some fun games.

&#x200B;

Another thing: during the OWCS gameshow the streamers ""flamed"" each other (for the content obviously) which is a behavior that is strictly prohibited in OW2 (words that would result in a ban).So what is the line between flaming and having a bit of healthy competition between weirdos.

1fqll8x,overwatch,About Kiriko's personality,"Something that has been bothering me for a while about Kiriko is not her skills or the amount of skins, but her personality, which is completely opposite to the cinematic. Kiriko in the game and Kiriko from the cinematic are two completely different characters, in the game she is very unbearable at times, voicelines that even became a meme, others like Pharah's: ""Oh Pharah-chah, I always win"". She seems to be trying to be really cool, this character is amazing, look how cheeky she is!! But in the end it's just annoying and boring, quirky as some would say.

Meanwhile, she's great in the cinematics! Charismatic! Are you going to tell me you didn't cry when you watched it? I cried, people got emotional, she's kind, protective, a character I wanted to play, that you and anyone else who saw it would want to play, but it's not her, and I think it's hard to be one day, our Kiriko is not the one we have, it's the one from the cinematic.

I want to play with a good character, but not just in gameplay, one that is interesting, with great interactions, a decent lore, a good personality to see the character have that matches him, make me feel the character and the work that went into making it something that fans will love, not something like: ""wait until you see me on my bike 👁️👄👁️💅"" Do you know what I mean?

I don't think non-Tank players realize how often their team crap on tanks. Tank is a difficult role, but i enjoy it, the difference a tank player can make, but the flak you get is incessant and tiresome.

I can play whatever support or DPS i want and no one complain, but i play tank and suddenly everyone is a tank expert telling me what tank they want me to play. I'm standing in front of everybody, everybody looking at every single of my mistakes.

I know that everyone wants to win their games, i do too, but i want to have some fun, like everyone else. I will try my hardest, and will play the most intelligently i can, but i will not play counterwatch tank that plays mind-numbing Orisa everygame just because you want your 2% higher winrate.

I did tried listening to my teammates and counter-picking, it didn't stop them flaming me when things didn't go well. If you wonder why there are shortage of few tank players, THIS IS WHY. Overwatch is still a social game, and nobody likes getting flamed every game, and if you play support you probably appreciate being praised in your games. It's the same for tanks, i don't need praise, just let me play and i will do my best to carry enable you, create openings, but at this point, i am fed up with comms and i have muted everyone. And yeah while that helps, that's not why i started playing overwatch, i just want to vibe with people and talk but here now i can't, not as tank.

In the end if i tryharded and countered every game i might hit plat 2, but i'm perfectly happy playing winston/rein in plat 5.

1h4tyil,fortnite,New XP cap is anti consumer and it should be adressed publicly.,"Imagine this - you just found out about Fortnite and about STW. Save the World has sold you and you want to play it but you're also not interested in BR or any other gamemodes at all.   
Also, the game advertises itself that you can earn XP anywhere you want and you aren't forced to play a certain gamemode.

So you install fortnite, buy the BPass and buy access to STW. Everything seems great, you just reached your first few levels and got first few rewards and you think to yourself ""how cool of them to let me gain XP for the pass by playing my favourite gamemode!""

But the player doesn't realize one thing - the season lasts exactly 105 days (or 14 weeks and few days) which means the weekly cap will be reset exactly 14 times before season ends

If my math is correct - 14 x 9 = 117  
Which basically means we are no longer able to finish the BPass fully by the end of this season just by playing STW 

Now let's get back to the theoritical new player that doesn't realize that and he missess out on big amount of rewards from the BPass, because they didn't play BR or did any challanges from other gamemodes.

They basically wasted their money, are angry and were forced to slowly crawl they way through the pass, just to be greeted with end of the season and lack of any chance to get rest of the rewards...

This is EXTREMELY anti-consumer friendly, especially since STW is a paid gamemode unlike rest of the game. What am I or any other person supposed to do now if I want to reach level 200 but aren't interested in playing BR or any other metaslop vomited onto my screen? Did Epic even considered that there are people that spent 99% of their time in STW?

1gxx8i6,fortnite,Founder's Weapons,"Okay so I made a Live Chat with Epic Games asking about a possibile return of Founder's Weapons. I asked because every Founder's Weapon has its Exclusive Perk. No other weapons have these perks. For example the Founder's Revolt has the Exclusive Perk that makes projectiles bounce to another enemy. The other ones have perks that gives a more Reload Speed, Damage or similar things...so nothing so special in my opinion. Instead speaking of the Nocturno...well...it's fantastic. Its Exclusive Perk is probably underrated but with a good hero build you can make a ton of damage with it and with the explosion. So what did they say?

Briefly no. But they told me to suggest this thing in one of their official channel. Actually I'm posting it in r/FORTnITE but I'll repost in the official one (r/FortniteBR) cuz they said I can post Save The World topic there too. 

Anyway, back in the suggestion:
Following the Exclusivity in Battle Royale with the cosmetics (like reskins or just different colors of exclusive skins), they could make a new Weapon Schematic with the same Exclusive Perk but with different perks or less damage, crit chance, crit damage, fire rate, reload speed, mag size or anything else. Doing this they won't make Founders mad about letting an expensive thing available again and at the same time giving the access of new builds etc to non Founders Players.

...or maybe they can add again the Founder's Bundle without V-Bugs Earnings.

I hope the StW Devs will read this hoping to be a good suggestion or something to encourage them to do something about it. Thanks for your attention. :)",625,210,1732359842,Positive,0.565,neutral,0.638

Plus, the lightning symbol for the power just fit more.

Plus the way the guns used to work with 'god rolls' and the overall energy of the community to the game is so different to what it was today.

With 31.30 we are flipping on some behind-the-scenes UI switches that may introduce a few bugs but will allow us to be more in parallel with other modes in Fortnite. We want to let you know why we’re making these updates and what you might encounter while we’re improving. 

By implementing these changes, we’re able to continue work to make the Emote Wheel more familiar and functional, add new menu options to the Lobby screens, and later down the line we plan to include Jam Track support and more to Save The World! 

We’re aware this change may cause a few bugs, and we aim to tackle these as quickly as possible. Here are a few known issues we’re aware of:

* Some UI screens on consoles do not navigate correctly.
* Backpack resets the selected item category after closing.
* Emote Wheel functionality may be degraded and impact camera movement.
* Storm King's health bar does not appear in the final phase.

We appreciate everyone’s enthusiastic feedback around these changes, and support with highlighting issues while we work through these new features. As always, if you spot any related issues that we’re not tracking, drop them in the comments below.

1gtnv9n,fortnite,Next StW Weapons,"So if we see what Fortnite added recently, they've added stuff from late Chapter 2. The Primordial Weapons are from C2S6 (unique for the theme and particularty about bows) and the Alien Weapons are from C2S7. In the C2S8 (the last season) they've added Sideways Weapons. I was thinking that they will add Sideways Weapons as next type of weapons but their ""6th perk"" (I mean their functionality) are kinda similar to some Heroes or other 6th perks. I must point out that I am a fan of these weapons and I would appreciate to have these weapons without the need of another weapon and a Hero Build Support to achieve something similar.

BUT
I think there is something more funny and interesting compared to these weapons: Kinetic Weapons

We got a Kinetic Hammer, an Ex-Caliber Rifle, a Kinetic Shiled (though I think this could be an Hero Ability), a Kinetic Katana and a Kinetic Boomerang in the first 3 Seasons of Chapter 3. From my experience I loved and still love the Hammer. I really really really want to jump and bonk some Husks with it.

Kinda off topic but I was also thinking about the Falcon Scout. Maybe not as a weapon but it could be cool to see it as a Hero ability to go around the map and search things or use it during the SSD to see how everything is going without attracting the Husks attention.

Maybe we can also mention the EvoChrome weapons. I don't really know how they could be adapted to StW. Maybe a progession damage and other things that stay stored until you play the mission the it resets in the next one?

I would like to listen your opinions and I really hope something mentioned here will be added in the game soon! :)

1fj6lxv,fortnite,Save The World: concept art ,"Wow... I have a lot to chat about here. 
Firstly , greetings everyone. It is me, StormKingˢᵗʷ again... Giving another long post regarding Save The World. 
I was researching some stuff about the game (nerd moment) and came across this concept art. 
I recall watching a video awhile back about Epic employees speaking about how Save The World was meant to be a more horrifying game... If we see in the concept art with the husks, they were a lot more mulitated and disfigured / terrifying. 

The reason being is due to how Save The World was meant to be presented as a more horror game I believe back then. But after some testing with the devs, they discovered how it would be too much to handle for a younger audience. Therefore , they toned it down to what it is today. 

Did you know that Takers back then would grab players and literally suck the soul out of them and the player would just drop dead? I found that to be really sick. Unfortunately it was taken out due to issues and the fact that it would be pretty unfair in single player... A bit of a bummer but I see why they did it. 

Overall, the husk concepts are super interesting to me... I love looking at old Save The World concepts and viewing all the potential the game could of had. I freaking love this game so much. The graphics are incredible as is the gameplay... But damn, this concept art is incredibly pleasing to view. 

Even Homebase seemed to have more back then... Which now we just see it in the opening cutscene of the tutorial in this game as well as in the Stonewood ssd (untextured of course)

There's more concept art, but I decided to show some of the cooler ones. Tbh the husk designs just really capture my attention... Surely it would've been too much for a younger audience to handle... BUT DAMN. I love it. Its sick. 

What are your thoughts? I'd love to hear!",387,15,1726597233,Neutral,0.508,fear,0.72

It took a little over a week to get here and right after college I rushed to the library to get it. 
When I opened it, I found out it was published in 2020...
I haven't read it yet, but I've scimmed through it and man... ITS AWESOME. 
It's unofficial, but I love it. I took some photos of some of the cool parts and pretty knowledgable things. 
It mostly covers going through Stonewood and such, and how to do the missions and how general parts of the game function. 
However, some things in this book are outdated... It even spoke about how STW is going to be free in the future which made me chuckle. 

I requested two others STW books that should show up within the next few days... But here are some of the photos I could get from here. The book is like 125 pages full of information for beginners.

What's up, I'm a mega STW fan , I'm pl 134 (almost 135) and I really appreciate this community. 
Reason being, I love to help others. I really do enjoy helping people progress through the game because one, they're accomplishing something which is amazing.. and two , I get to play missions in my favorite game while helping someone in the process which makes them happy and brings me joy that I can help others succeed.
I've been recognised in some games by people here , shoutout to you guys.. it makes my week everytime. I really do appreciate you all. It's a joy to be here and being supported and known is something that I do enjoy , and even if I have college now and it's trickier to play , that won't stop me from helping all of you. I want to help out , I want to engage , make friends , get along , and do missions. This game is so much fun and being able to do many loadouts as well as experiment with trap tunnels is a ton of fun. 
I specifically enjoy building Twine SSDS the most and doing MSK.. Personally , I mostly do MSK but I build a Twine SSD regularly and I'm happy to build for anyone as long as you give me a notice. 
You are all very nice. I have met a few not so friendly individuals as well as some few scammers , but otherwise... This is the most amazing community I've been in and I mean it when I say that. 
You are all great Commanders. Fun to interact with and play the game with. 
This game is the most fun I've ever had and if I could take on the dev team... I would. I would revive this game and I would do weekly updates.... Trust 🫸🫷

1eoco61,fortnite,The Future Of Save The World ,"Greetings all, it's me StormKingˢᵗʷ..again with another rant about Save The World. 
I feel like this game had(s) a lot of potential. The developers could have made this game into so much more. If there was a Twine Peaks story, I feel that much more people would play... As if they added one it would bring a lot of the old player base back as well as perhaps grow popularity to lure BR players into this amazing game mode. 

I feel like when people first start out Save The World, they...have no clue what they're looking at. They got no clue how husks ai behaves, how to use the guns , how to build , and how the UI is. When I first started, I had no idea what heroes and survivors and schematics were and it all looked so confusing to me. 
I feel that's the fun in this game is learning it all and progressing through it , with fails in missions and struggling is where the fun comes because you learn from what you do wrong. 
If they were to add more to this game (such as the Twine Peaks story I mentioned above) then the future would be solid for this game. However , I feel like without regular updates (yes I know, they just added the two new heroes and such, but I'm talking that they need to do this more often since we just got some players come back...epic, see how much people care?) that nobody will play... And I don't want to see this game mode decay because it is quite literally one of my sources of joy. 

There is so much they can do with this game. They can add moe mythics such as a bow, a shotgun... They can add even more heroes, properly do six star evolution... Make superchargers go further than 144... Etc.
New missions can be added as well and old scrapped ones should return. 
As much as I adore this game, the future needs to be talked about more so maybe Epic can see how much we care and how much we don't want this amazing game mode to be forgotten about. Even if it's spiking a bit at the moment with the new heroes, I feel it won't be long before people disappear again... 

Save Save The World!!! This is a fantastic and very fun game mode with awesome loadouts and trap techniques..

1gv8jwq,fortnite,Extremely hyped for the ventures season tomorrow + Frostnite,"Greetings Save The World community. It's StormKingˢᵗʷ again. I usually make these posts everytime a new Ventures season is going to come out if it contains a lot of content. 
The Frozen Fjords Venture season is the season that I never really played. The reason being because I was in Stonewood/Plankerton at the time of its release. I was a clueless new player and I didn't really have much knowledge on the game. My friend at the time made me play a few Ventures because he told me it's better to focus on it than my main quests. So I got to about level 11.

I thought the map was super neat and looked nice... But I remember being annoyed by the whole terrain thing and how half the time you couldn't build because of it. 
I heard this frustration on the Reddit a lot when I would read posts.. made me avoid the season shortly afterwards. 
I'm excited to try it properly because I really like winter biomes and this one has really nice graphics and a pleasing soundtrack. 
I also like the husk designs in this season. Brings out the Christmas vibe. 
I just know that this season is cut two weeks shortee than most  though, which is unfortunate but at least we still get like 2 months of this. 

As for Frostnite... Boy am I very hyped. I played one game of it last year and lasted only five minutes because at the time I was in Stonewood and so was everybody else in my team. So we did not know what to do and the husks destroyed our burner and we didn't get enough bluglo. 
Also I had such a hard time killing a Krampus smasher. (That design is so sick btw)
I am going to play sm of this with my friends. We will be starting off easy then eventually doing the PL 128. We will be running constructors and outlanders so that it's a good chance of winning. I'm hoping to get enough power cells for some weapons and hopefully get to do challenges in the future like ""no discharger"" challenges or something like that. 

I also really want the Frostnite banners. They're super cool tbh and I also want some of the heroes and weapons you get from Frostnite. 
All I wanna say is... My dumb self vouchered Ice King last year when he was available in Frostnite because I was a new player and went ""oh, Ice King from br ch1 s7!"" ☠️☠️
At least I know much more about the game now and how to properly build and trap and use loadouts and weapons... Back then I was so clueless. 

I hope everyone else will enjoy the Frozen Fjords season with the terrain update we got not too long ago and with the return of Frostnite! It's going to be a blast and Christmas break will definitely be the ultimate grind time for me 🫡

As I was exploring the grey part of the map, a survivor spawned. Before I could save him, someone gave the medkit guy his medkit and we reached 9 bonus survivors saved.

Ray then chimed “you saved everyone” literally while I’m trying to protect this surv. This actually lowkey pissed me off cuz I like saving survivors and Ray booted me out of the game, abandoning the dude. WTF! Like that’s so mean and I feel terrible. Never let this happen again this ruined my day.

1fy9gn9,fortnite,The nostalgia of a player who's been playing for a year,"Greetings. It's StormKingˢᵗʷ again. I normally write a lot of posts for this game, but this time I want to talk about the nostalgia of it. I have been playing this game since August 2023. Back then, I had no idea about how any of the game worked. I was clueless on survivor squads, heroes, and more. I used to put random heroes in my loadout because I simply didn't know any better. I struggled so much at the game, and I even didn't know how traps worked...at all. 

I revisited my Plankerton last night. I found open Broadsides (level 46, epic) and one tile high ceiling drops (level 22, epic). I really had no clue of the game. But... I miss that feeling. 
It's weird. I can't explain it. I have been playing for onyl a year, and yet I still miss it. 
During October last year, I was still in Stonewood. I didn't really play until December 2023 (after the chapter 1 season left) but, I still played somewhat. 
I don't remember much of Stonewood, but I remember struggling through the fifth Plankerton ssd, to the point where I had to ask my PL 129 friend for assistance. 

I recall my first ever time doing Repair The Shelter (my currently most played mission), I had no clue what to do. I ran diagnostics and ran around cluelessly. I used SEE-Bot for every single module, and when I got a raid I had to run over and panic build (no constructor). 
Even after getting all the modules, I still didn't build. I almost failed that. (It was in no fill)
Same goes for Refuel The Homebase (in fill this time), I had no clue what to do. I thought it was the coolest mission ever (now my least favorite). 
My friend would tell me that Deliver The Bomb was impossible and took long to do. I genuinely feared it and once I got to it in the story, it wasn't so bad. 
Plankerton was a journey... A good one. 

Now onto Canny. Canny is where my love for STW really sparked. I remember looking up how to progress through the story (how to do quests) and struggling. I thought LVL 46 and 70 were damn near impossible. 
I loved the look of the desert. It made me love the game more. 
The reason I made this post is because I was in a 160 Ghost Town the other night, and the tone of the music just hit me and brought me back to my Canny grinding days. 
The feeling of being a newer player was unexplainable and... Fantastic. I miss it everyday. 
Although I still love the game now, I miss how I used to feel when I struggled and needed evolution materials and training manuals and schematics. It was a good time. 

Getting to Twine made me so happy. The day I finished the final mission in Canny was the day I will never forget. 
This game is truly a gem..
 I could go on forever about how much it means to me. 
I am now PL 135, I have completed 4 Ventures seasons, done MSK solo and do 160 solo... I never would have gotten here if it wasn't for the amazing community of this game and the game itself. I love STW with a passion... And I miss it. 🙏",222,19,1728312515,Negative,0.574,neutral,0.929

This issue is exclusive to PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X. Reflections are visible on Xbox Series S on all modes. 

Other graphics issues happen with Save the World, such as too many fog and lighting being low quality, issues that aren't on other consoles, such as Xbox Series S and PS4. Save the World looks better on Xbox Series S (except for resolution, of course) than Xbox Series X and PS5.

I always have anxiety entering a survivor mission because I never know if I can do my mission in peace or I’ll get stuck there for 20 minutes. 

Please if you don’t know the root cause, maybe just make it so we can leave the mission after the first 10 minutes without the last survivor and count as completed, or spawn more survivors. ",208,34,1725364328,Negative,0.923,neutral,0.645

But STW is paid for. We PAID for this and we get this in return. It's seriously unfair and I really want them to reconsider it. It was not a smart decision even if they changed the bp system in my opinion.

As I said before.. this game had so much potential. Of course it's still amazing today , but the old idea of it.. the horror aspect. There's something about it that really brings me in. 
It's nothing too special, the current crafting ui is pretty similar-ish to this... But this just feels different. I would've liked to test this.

1giocgf,apexlegends,Respawn. You used to PROUDLY hype up your new Seasons. This Radio Silence is not working at all. Look at 3 years ago.,"Check this picture out. 

Your trailers used to get 3 million to 10 million views! Now last season your big gameplay trailer (which shows a new map by the way) only got just over 800k views.

Think of the story behind every new season:

We had the Story from the Outlands trailer to get the Lore in and people excited.

Then we had the Launch trailers WITHOUT patch notes so players were taking the trailer apart to figure stuff out about the new Legend, new maps/POIs.

Then we had the gameplay trailer which got everyone hyped. 

They we had the Meet the Legend Trailer and finally the Battle Pass trailer with patchnotes released at the same time. Literally constant hit after hit after hit getting casual and competitive players hyped for nearly 2 weeks straight. 

Now?. We get some lifeless pictures posted on Twitter and that's it? 

I'm guessing they either want to do a huge massive explosion of trailers all in one day or something was suddenly changed last minute behind the scenes has got them doing some quick edits of the trailer as they're suddenly changing some shit. Maybe Black Ops 6 spooked them. That and the conference call meeting thing where EA admitted they need to go better things aren't looking good.

Look we all know who is getting ""reworked"" next season. How about a ""Meet the *new* Legend"" trailer? Anything will do.

Any idea what they are doing?

1dyqtmi,apexlegends,"For people wondering why EA is raising bp price now...
","As background, I worked as an equity analyst covering media and gaming stocks for years. No need to go into specifics on this subreddit but on a high-level when companies begin to raise price it's because the user base is slowing. An example is Netflix, who recently raised annual pricing because user growth has slowed (mainly because they have so many users already). But you need to keep investors happy; they value stocks based on the future cash that company can generate. If your growth slows, your stock gets decimated. So one way to unlock more revenue is to monetize your user base more.

In regards to Apex, you can see the avg. player per month steam figures attached but the TLDR is the player base is the lowest its been since launch. If user growth slows (or declines in Apex's case) you need to raise price. They're fully aware this change may drop active users but they're estimating they'll make up for it on the backend with less people purchasing a more expensive seasonal bp. If this change doesn't keep revenue at the same level or higher than last quarter, they won't really have additional levers to pull for revenue growth.

Overall, it's really a bad sign for the health of Apex. No the game won't go away. It probably generates close to 10-20% of $EA earnings (that's a guess). It's too important to the overall value of Electronic Arts. But if this double seasonal bp change doesn't increase quarterly revenue i'd imagine EA either gives Respawn more resources to spark growth and if that doesn't work they'll look to spin-off Respawn (sell it to a competitor, have Respawn buyback the company, or let Respawn go public). Which could be good tbh because they'd focus on keeping players happy vs. monetization.

Anyway, as a casual player who's frustrated with cheaters, etc. I just wanted to give my two cents on the matter.

EDIT: i've had some DMs about EA selling Respawn. Just to clarify, it's an extremely low chance this ever happens. EA will exhaust all resources to make sure Apex succeeds. Additionally, they won't sunset the game;. it's career suicide if you write-off \~15% of your market value overnight. But if you're management of EA and you notice Apex is slipping or will continue slipping, you look to offload that asset ASAP. Once growth decelerates faster, you'll get pennies for what otherwise could have been billions in cash. ",1494,294,1720490656,Neutral,0.546,neutral,0.571

I keep hearing that this game just ""doesn't feel casual"". Which is what Respawn were trying to implement. They even mentioned in their April new tax year call/presentation thing. I'm sure they mentioned that Apex Legends, whilst a great game,. Is a very HARD GAME to get into. And that in itself will drive players away.

I honestly believe that the ""showing how sweaty you are"" thing is mentally draining. Always seeing who kills you and ALWAYS, SEEING, 20 BOMB, 4K, TRIPPLE MASTER, TRIPPLE PRED BADGES from anyone who kills you. Over and over and over again. TDM, Mix Tape, Control, Pubs, hell even in Bronze 2. You can't turn a blind eye towards sweaty players because the game makes it known ""Hey! A sweaty player just killed you!"". I'm sure in games like Fortnight and Warzone it doesn't show enemy stats right? So you don't even really know who killed you and it doesn't really bother you.

Hello, I'm a Korean Apex Legends player who enjoys the game. I've played for 3100 hours without ever using cheats, but my account got banned, so I'm writing this post. On May 15th, while playing ranked on Kings Canyon, as you can see in the video below, I was playing solo and managed to eliminate faide from behind, then finished off their team. After that, faide spectated me and reported me for using ESP, judging by my gameplay. Then, on May 17th, I came across a YouTube clip where I was reported for cheating, and when I logged into my account, it was banned. I contacted live chat support, and although they said my account wasn't banned, it still was. I asked them to check again and relayed my situation to the relevant department, and now I'm waiting for a response. I feel really unfair :( I want to know if EA banned me because they accurately detected cheating or if faide, a prominent streamer, reported me without verification. I've been playing since Season 9 and have never used cheats, so I'm very angry at EA for banning my account. It's frustrating that they ban regular user accounts without properly catching many cheaters. I'm so upset and I want help, so I wrote a post on the Apex Legends community on Reddit. I'm sorry if this translation sounds awkward.

1dyeic6,apexlegends,How To Effectively Protest BP Changes,"It's safe to assume we as consumers don't like the announced changes today to the battle passes, but complaining on Reddit is not going to do anything. Reddit is a small fraction of a percent of the playerbase. 

We need to protest if we want change. 

And an effective, organized protest means going out of our way to make Apex Legends worse in the short term as to prevent these changes making it much worse in the long term.

What does that look like? As of today, commit to the following:

- Do not make any purchases in Apex Legends.
- Do not participate in any Apex Legends events.
- Do not play Apex Legends unless participating in in-game protest events.
- Post about your participation in these protests on social media.
- Do not watch any Apex Legends streams, especially any official Apex Legends tournaments or streams.
- Encourage other players to join in these protests by linking them to protest material. (***DO NOT HARASS***)
- Request Apex Legends streamers and content creators to cover the protests and not make Apex Legends content (***DO NOT HARASS*** *especially if they feel that participating would threaten their livelihood*)
- Do not make Apex Legends fan art or other fan content unless it is related to the protest.
- Post links to these protests under all official Apex Legends social media across all platforms. (***DO NOT HARASS INDIVIDUAL DEVELOPERS OF THE GAME***)
- Uninstall the game if you feel that helps you commit to not playing the game.
- Brainstorm/Organize/Participate other online and in-game protest events. (***DO NOT SUGGEST ACTION THAT IS UNLAWFUL OR AGAINST REDDIT ToS***. This is a video game protest. Not civil rights. Examples of what **NOT** to suggest due to ToS: review bombing, brigading (organizing against other sites or communities), etc (I am in communication with mods to determine what is/isn't against ToS))

EA is a huge company and are motivated by ~~greed~~ profits. They need to see that the changes proposed today are not an avenue for more profit, but a destruction of their consumer base. We need to organize to do that.

- - -

NOTE: This thread is NOT a thread to discuss your feelings on the Battle Pass changes. There is the Megathread for that. This is purely a call to action of Apex Legends players to protest these changes and a discussion on how best to do that.

If you do not believe these changes are worth protesting, that is your right and I respect that. Be equally respectful of those that believe it is worth protesting.

So... Let's get started.",1431,342,1720459248,Negative,0.691,anger,0.878

Like reaching Masters/Pred should apply some hard coding to your account that will not physically allow for you to me matched with non-Masters/Preds. 

Don’t care if queue times are 30 mins, don’t care if you only play against the same hundred people over and over. That’s what you get for being that good. If you’re going to grind to Pred, you have to play with Preds. 

“So just because i ranked really high means i can’t play with anyone besides the best?” 

Yes, Lebron James can’t compete in a high school basketball match. Magnus Carlsen can’t join a chess camp tournament. Randy Johnson can’t pitch in Little League.

1h2f7pr,apexlegends,Apex isn’t dying because new players aren’t staying. Apex is dying because the CORE players are dissatisfied and leaving in droves.,"The beginning of Apex’s recent decline can be pinpointed to the recent BP changes they made in July, where they announced that you would no longer be able to purchase the BP with Apex Coins. The community so outraged that they review-bombed Apex on Steam to the point where its total review score became “Mixed” instead of “Mostly Positive.” *Several* posts on this sub were made by people announcing they would be quitting the game entirely, all due to the BP changes. 

Of course, EA later allowed BP purchases with Apex Coins, but the damage was already done. Players had quit and Apex’s reputation was soiled.

#Reason 2 
The second reason why Apex has been dying is due to the recent metas and horrific matchmaking changes in Ranked. We’ve had bad metas before, but holy fuck did they drop the ball on these last two seasons. The akimbo Mozams were broken to the point where if you weren’t using them, you were actively throwing the game. It took them weeks to nerf them, and you know what they do next? They drop yet another insufferable meta based around Supports with infinite heals and revives. 

And don’t even get me started on the matchmaking in Ranked. I’m sure you’ve seen enough posts of Masters and Preds in Plat lobbies to know. Not only are Respawn not fixing their notoriously bad matchmaking, they are pretty much actively sponsoring smurfing in Ranked with their decisions.

**None of this has to do with the “new player experience.”** New players don’t give a fuck about the BP, or the metas, or Ranked’s horrible matchmaking. Yes, attracting and keeping new players is hard, but the VAST majority of the decline of the game is due to the older, core playerbase of the game leaving in droves because they are fed up with Apex’s problems.

#It’s the CORE playerbase that is dissatisfied, not new players.

I am tired of seeing people grossly oversimplifying Apex’s problems to just blaming the skill gap and, perhaps more egregiously, suggesting that the solution is increased EOMM/SBMM in Pubs. **SBMM fucks over the core playerbase in favor of newer players.** It is designed specifically to do this because the core playerbase is far more willing to put up with a bad experience than a newer player. 

This is obvious; most of the complaining you see on this sub are made by people who play this game every single day. But these players are only willing to put up with so much bullshit before they quit as well. **That is what is currently happening, right now.**

 #The Solution

The solution is simple. The damage dealt by the BP changes is already done. But here’s what they can still do.

- End ~~Respawn-sponsored smurfing~~ seasonal rank resets and ranked splits entirely so that PREDS stay in PRED lobbies. Tighten up the SBMM in RANKED, not PUBS. Pubs should have completely random matchmaking and act as a funnel for new players into Ranked.

- Quit fucking with the meta. These last two seasons have had the most un-fun metas in Apex history.

- Improve the solo player experience. Add a mecernary matchmaking option or make Solos permanent.

**TL;DR: The CORE playerbase leaving, not new players not staying, is the reason why Apex is dying. Fix the issues the CORE playerbase has.**",1074,404,1732860240,Negative,0.69,anger,0.961

I am a 1x Master player and 3x Diamond player that played the hell out of Apex for \~4 years. IMO, I think Apex is one of the best BR games that have been on the market, but I had to take a step away from it about 7-8 months ago, and I haven't even had so much of a single itch to go back and play it again. For me, it was primarily the matchmaking which lead to a lack of casual play that pushed me away. I was sick and tired of my public matches being matchmade like ranked games.

*You’ve spoken, and we’ve listened. With the release of Season 22* ***we will restore the ability to get the Premium Battle Pass for 950 Apex Coins.*** *We recognize that we could have handled the Battle Pass changes better—that's on us.*

*It’s our intention to improve the overall value and experience across our Battle Pass offerings. For a summary of the updated Battle Pass offerings starting with Season 22 Split 2 on September 17th, please check out the infographic. Here's what we'd like you to know:*

* *With the launch of Season 22 on August 6th through Split 1, we want to give you an opportunity to get the Premium Battle Pass.* *You can unlock it by completing a series of simple in-game challenges.* 
* *Starting with Split 2 on September 17th, you can get the Premium Battle Passes the same way as before: by using 950 Apex Coins. You’ll be able to earn enough Apex Coins via the Battle Pass to get future passes.*
* *The Battle Pass options now include better rewards—and with the re-tuned Battle Pass challenges, it'll be faster to complete at only 60 levels.*

*Moving forward, we recognize that we need to be more timely, transparent, and consistent in our  communications with you.* ***Your priorities are our priorities: cheaters, game stability, and quality of life updates are top of mind. We need to get better and it's why we're acknowledging them here.*** *As a next step, there are a number of improvements and game stability bug fixes coming in Season 22 that will be outlined in the Patch Notes dropping on August 5th.*

however, saying health bars have soured my enjoyment of this season is an understatement. Not only have Seer, mirage, caustic etc been severely nerfed as a result, but it messes with the core gameplay in an extremely unhealthy way.

""Fake Posturing"" has been completely removed due to this, and fights involving more than one squad have been 10x worse as a result. the dynamics of basically any engagement has been severely damaged as well.

I completely understand that they want to make the game more approachable to newer players, but doing something this drastic really doesn't solve anything. at the very least health bars need to stay out of ranked, but preferably, I would like if they were just in bot royale so newer players can better understand the ttk of different weapons.

1e10b9p,apexlegends,Community Update: Season 22 Battlepass Changes,"###Hey Legends,

###I am pretty sure you are all well aware of the recent announcement in regards to upcoming changes with the battlepass, if you somehow managed to browse the subreddit and dodged all posts about it, please see the [following thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/apexlegends/comments/1dyblr3/apex_legends_battle_pass_updates_season_22/).

---

These upcoming changes have left many of us feeling frustrated and disappointed. There are several reasons for this(not including all previous anti consumer practices), but amongst the most common ones are:

* Lose ability to finish a battlepass and thus earning enough apex coins to buy the next battlepass. This is due to future battlepasses will just be purchaseble with straight up money and not apex coin.

* Price is to high for what is on offering. 10€/half season. 20€/season. Typically a Apex season is 3months. That is 80€/year that is being asked from the premium pass. 
 * 20€/half season. 40€/season for the Premium+. This is 160€/year.

      * This would be the price on just the battlepass, not to mention several collection events and things in between. This is a lot more compared to what other games, even full subscription MMORPGs are offering.

* Battlepasses being timed, as compared to other games where once you buy the pass you have an infinite amount of time to complete it.


---

We have seen threads and comments popping up all over reddit( /r/apexlegends, /r/gaming, /r/games), youtube, discord, twitter ec.t. of people expressing thier own concerns and dissatisfaction with the changes. 

However after discussing with the mod team and having received numerous amount of modmails with suggestions and questions about what course of action we as a community should take, we have agreed on that we need to make our voices heard.

What we mean by this is NOT to go shout derogatory words at individual figures or send them death threats. This should be clear to everyone but we would like to remind you that the people in power who makes the decisions such and the battlepass change are not the people who would browse the subreddit or other social media, they are not the ones who will see it.

That is why instead we ask you to be smart about this. That is why we are instead asking you to share your thoughts in a review of the upcoming changes on your respective platforms review page. Don't just say *""ranked and sound is broken but expensive battlepass omegalul""*. Be honest in the review onto why you think it is a step in the wrong direction, or if you find something good with the changes such as it being a shorter pass for example, write that as well. But be mature about it.

This is not a call to action to go review bomb the game, but to share your honest opinions about how you feel about it in it's current and upcoming state.

The reasons why this matters is because:
 
* The people in charge actively monitors reviews and takes them into consideration when making decisions about the game based on KPIs

* If should so be the case, a large number of negative reviews can send a strong message that something needs to change.

* By speaking from the heart and brain with real words and not just ""game dead go play skibidi Fortnite"", we can demonstrate the size and passion we have for the game as a community, which can't be ignored.

Again, we can't stress enough how important it is that despite how angry you are about the upcoming changes to be respectful and constructive in your feedback and reviews. We do not want to be seen as trolls. We are also not out to harm anyone feelings. We just want to be heard and have a positive gaming experience, not just now, but also in the future. //Apex Mod Team",876,291,1720733520,Negative,0.674,anger,0.946

1e78ug1,apexlegends,Finished V2 of my G7 Scout!,"Here is my G7 Scout chambered in .308 Win. Features: Integrated, fully functional, bipod which locks up into the position shown when not in use and also locks down; 2-7x scope mounted onto the picatinny rail;  functional (but needs tuning) ammo counter built into the stock that uses an accelerometer to feel recoil.


I know someone's gonna cry about the same things they always do, so:

• Yes, it is impractical from a tactical standpoint. Some people like what is called ""fun"" and you should try it.

• Yes, the scope DOES have that much eye relief because it's made specifically for the M1 family of rifles.

• No, it's not as durable as the original stock, but it's not exactly made to look like a gun from a video game because I want to use it in combat when sh*t hits the fan.

• Bonus for any Titanfall fans. No, the G7 Scout isn't from Titanfall. It's predecessors the G2A4 and G2A5 are, but it was redesigned once more for Apex Legends.",874,58,1721408819,Neutral,0.497,neutral,0.574

Because once you were flesh, you couldn't aim because of the punch and that gave you the instinct of popping a bat. Now since there is no aimpunch, you are committing more to the fights, the TTK is not lower. You just don't realize you have no shields. Also, shields were more important back then for the exact same reason and now it is equalized since there is no difference between HP and Armor, besides hammerpoints.

The healthbars on enemies also make your enemies and also you to commit more than before. Back then, it needed some time to calculate how much damage you did in a skirmish. And sometimes, this was false info as you or enemy miscalculated and pushed before it's time, leading to ones demise. Now, you can see exactly how much resource enemy has. You commit more-enemy commits more.

These sensory changes made everyone fight more agressively, one made you think you have resources left with half hp no armors, and the other made you more agressive  since he is ""REALLY ONE SHOT"" this time.",799,201,1723574409,Negative,0.479,neutral,0.715

1es5mb4,apexlegends,The health-bars change has basically ruined Caustic. This needs tuning ASAP. ,"The design idea behind Caustic’s gas is that it is multipurpose in the sense that A) It can do damage over a period of time and B) It can also have a smoke grenade-like effect and blind players to an extent. 

This is conveyed by Caustic’s passive (Nox Vision) being an ability to specifically see outlines through the gas traps as they do cloud players pretty well from a distance. 

Nox Vision before the season 22 update was by FAR the worst passive ability in apex legends as most of the time it didn’t work and when it did work it was also only a small advantage. 

It is now absolutely hilarious that every single player as long as they land a single shot on Caustic’s thicc booty gets a vision ability that is light years ahead of Nox Vision.

Caustic’s gas traps can only now be used exclusively for very small doors and buildings. 

If a player shoots the gas, you and your team are now blinded by your own gas, with a passive ability that doesn’t work, whilst the players shooting you get a constant beacon of your exact position. Comical. 

Respawn acknowledged that for Bangalore, the healthbars would make the character basically redundant but did not think far ahead enough to also apply this to Caustic.

TLDR: Caustic is the worst he’s ever been and I think Respawn needs to do some tuning here.

This map was designed to offer players a fresh and innovative experience. While it retains the core elements that define a great Apex map, we also pushed the boundaries by incorporating numerous buildings, emphasizing verticality, and creating varied landscapes. These changes ensure some of the most diverse fights and end-ring locations across the map.

# CONTROLLER & RECON CLASS PERKS

This season we’re beginning a much more intentional push on what classes mean to the core of the game by bringing new tactical class passives to the Controller and Recon classes. Both will continue to bring strategic depth to their squad via interactions with Survey Beacons and Ring Consoles, but they’ll now have new intrinsic power that better supports their role on the team.

# CONTROLLER CLASS

NEW CLASS PERK

* Zone Overcharge: Controller Legends now have extra shield capacity when playing in zone
   * The Zone automatically grants an overcharge of 25HP shield capacity
   * This capacity is permanent while the player remains in zone (white ring area on the map)
   * Overcharge is lost when leaving zone (after 5s delay)
   * Overcharge can be healed with cells, batteries and abilities while in zone
   * If a player enters the zone at full shields, the overcharge pip will fill automatically
   * If a player acquires a shield core that overcharges beyond this extra zone capacity, that additional overcharge will still drain normally but the zone overcharge will remain
   * Zone Overcharge will never enhance Legend Armor beyond maximum (red) capacity



NEW QUALITY OF LIFE

* Remote Pick-Up: Controller Legends can now remotely pick-up their undamaged Tacticals by looking back at them and pressing a button
   * Additionally, if the player abandons the area, they will prompted to recover ALL possible objects
   * Remotely recovering these objects will restore the Tactical charge

*Dev Note: Controller Legends are at their best when playing for zone position. This season, we’re rewarding that behavior in Legends who don’t want to skim the edges of battle hunting for EVO, and instead allow them to maintain an equal footing on their armor when playing to their strengths. Gaining knowledge of the next ring and keeping a good position will be important to maintaining this advantage.*

*Additionally, we noticed that many newer players to the Controller Class struggle with management of their Tacticals. This takes a step towards making it more desirable to experiment with traps or to feel more comfortable setting up shop with less worry about having to abandon your entire setup to move to a slightly better building. We want Controller players to play with their kit more freely and not have to do extra running around to recycle charges or feel locked into their setup if they have to move.*



# RECON CLASS

NEW CLASS PERK

* Threat Vision: Recon Legends now gain threat vision when aiming down sights
   * Threat vision will highlight enemies that the character has Line of Sight to whenever using ADS (aim down sights) 
   * This ability will not work through walls or smoke, and it’s limited in range by the type of scope or zoom range of an ability

SURVEY BEACONS

* Faster to use \~3s (was \~7.5s)
* Shortened range of \~500m (was scanning the entire map)
* No longer randomly distributed and all will now be turned on with every map
* Scanning now grants 75 EVO (was 200 EVO)
* Now pulses 3 times over 15s, with each pulse taking a snapshot of enemies in range for 5s
* Now release a large in-world scan wave that players can spot to identify an activated beacon (enemies no longer receive a scan message)
* Enemies scanned will display along the edges of the mini-map even if not in

*Dev Note: Recon Legends are defined as Legends who are about Enemy Intel & Tracking; which is a core part of each character’s play pattern, but to date, the only class benefit was something players had to seek out via Survey Beacons. We’re ratcheting up the scouting role for Recon Legends this season and putting class power directly into their hands. With ADS Threat Vision, these characters are now adept at spotting distant targets for their team, and now innately do something that no other class can.*

*The changes to Survey Beacons should allow players to make them a more tactical part of their play, rather than just a strategic element. The full map scan was really only useful to a small number of high level players, and often the scan messaging would turn your team into a magnet for others to hunt. Now, being more frequent, faster to use, and giving more intel for longer makes it easier to use the beacons with confidence and hunt in the immediate area or note secure paths out of a POI for rotation.*



# UPDATE: STAT TRACKERS

We've made a huge quality of life upgrade to Stat Trackers and are separating out the Stat and the Art. You'll now be able to set these on your Legend Banner Cards separately. The Art on your trackers have also been made universal, which means they can be applied to any Legend Banner Card. We wanted to give players more ways to customize their Banner Cards and let you show off your more than just one Legend there. It’s also a great way to show off your Legend ships!

Login at any point during Shockwave to automatically unlock three new Stat Trackers to add to your mix and match collection.



# SHOCKWAVE BATTLE PASS

For a summary of the updated Battle Pass offerings, please check out [our dedicated blog and infographic here](https://www.ea.com/en-gb/games/apex-legends/news/battle-pass-update). Here's a TLDR:

* With the launch of Season 22 on August 6th through Split 1, we want to give you an opportunity to get the Premium Battle Pass. You can unlock it by completing a series of simple in-game challenges before the end of Split 1 on September 17th at 10:00am PT: 
   * Play 2 matches in Trios on a specific map
   * Deal 1,000 damage as a Recon or Controller Legend in BR
   * Open 15 Supply Bins in any mode
   * Deal 500 damage in BR with a specific weapon 
   * Complete 10 levels of the Battle Pass
* Starting with Split 2 on September 17th, you can get the Premium Battle Passes the same way as before: by using 950 Apex Coins. You’ll be able to earn enough Apex Coins via the Battle Pass to get future passes.
* The Battle Pass options now include better rewards—and with the re-tuned Battle Pass challenges, it'll be faster to complete at only 60 levels.

# GAMEPLAY UPDATES

**Aim Assist**

* Console crossplay into PC lobbies: Aim Assist strength reduced 18%
* Console performance mode crossplay into PC lobbies: Aim Assist strength reduced 22%
* Controller on PC: Aim Assist strength reduced 25%

*Dev Note: We value our accessibility as a cross-platform game, but it's equally important for us to monitor that ecosystem. Experiential stories from all types of players tracks with the data we're seeing when it comes to encounter win rate between different peripherals. Apex Legends is a competitive shooter, and simply put, aim assist is too strong. Aim assist will never be removed as it's a critical accessibility feature. Console lobbies remain unaffected; this only impacts players on controllers in PC lobbies (our most competitive ecosystem). This change doesn't solve the intricacies of all aim assist hot topics, but it should help level the playing ground.*



**Aim Flinch**

* Aim Flinch has been removed from all weapons & most abilities
* Damage from the ring still incurs Aim Flinch

*Dev Note: Let's be honest, no one really had love for Aim Flinch. We’ve made the call to eliminate it from all weapons and most Legend abilities. However there are some Legend abilities that do benefit from the added feedback like dunking on someone with a Newcastle ult. We’ll keep an eye on abilities that may need additional feedback as we see how this change affects the game.*

  
**Loot Bin Reset**

Starting with Shockwave, all loot bins will close and reroll their loot with a significantly increased chance at high tier and rare loot at the mid-way point of the match.

* Bins that have been rerolled will appear slightly differently than ones that have never been opened
* After the reset, multiple bins will convert into Legendary loot bins that provide smart loot, guaranteeing that the contents to be relevant upgrades for a squad

**Mythic Bin**

* One Mythic bin will spawn into the match with:
   * One random Care Package weapon
   * Gold version weapons of those that the squad is running at the time of opening the bin
   * Medical supplies and grenades
   * Large XP bonus to the squad
* Mythic bins are locked and require players to hold interact on them for a significant amount of time to crack them open for their team
* Displayed on the map and minimap



**Loot Pool**

* Reduce the spawn rate of Purple and Gold attachments by about 50%

*Dev Note: Access to high tier attachments in the early game have started to feel too common which results in squashing the power progression over the course of a match. By reducing the amount of high tier loot in the early game players will be fighting on more even terms. To compensate for this reduction, “Loot Bin Reset” improves the overall quality of loot in the world which should provide a much smoother transition to end game power.* 



**Reorganization: Death Boxes and Loba’s Black Market**

* Healing items now have a dedicated row and have been removed from the consumables category
* Shield Cores have been moved to the top of the Gear category

*Dev Note: These items are critical to a player’s success in the outlands, bringing them up to the top with consistent positions should expedite the looting process and eliminate some tedious scrolling for players.*

https://preview.redd.it/jnp86g2v5vgd1.png?width=358&format=png&auto=webp&s=013303d1ee63d49e13dd7ca57d4e573ec8f1ade5



**Traversal**

* Mantling at the same time in the same spot as a teammate no longer forces both players to drop



# BATTLE SENSE

**Better Ammo Awareness & Feedback**

* Critical Ammo state will now kick on when a player has 0 relevant ammo in their inventory
* On screen Low Ammo indicators kick on earlier allowing players more opportunity to find ammo
   *  Indicator also now displays the icon of the ammo type
* Pinging for ammo will now display the ammo icon in the kill feed
* When emptying a weapon of all reserve ammo it will now automatically ping that the player is in need of ammo 
* When looking at ammo on the ground the tooltip now displays compatibility with any of your currently equipped weapons

*Dev Note: Running out of ammo is never fun and our low ammo states were set up in a way that didn’t provide much time or information for players to action on. These changes intend to set players up for more success when it comes to maintaining their ammo economy.*



**Enemy Health Bars**

When damaging an enemy, players are now shown the enemy’s Armor and Health state. This Health Bar is only active for a brief time after dealing damage and then fades away. Health Bars, like Enemy Highlights require direct line of sight.



**Enemy Highlight**

Enemy players will now be highlighted with a red outline similar to how allies are highlighted with a blue one. The highlight is most prominent at close ranges and the intensity fades as targets get farther away. Enemy Highlights require direct line of sight (you can breathe now, Bangalore mains).

Both Enemy Health Bars and Enemy Highlights can be toggled on/off in Settings.

*Dev Note: Visual clarity and accurate information are imperative to a player’s success. These new features, Highlighting and Health Bars, are intended to level the playing field and combat the intensity of battle. No one likes mag dumping into their squadmates back because they totally thought that was the enemy Lifeline.*

*Experienced players can easily develop the skill to call out health values of enemies based on the amount of damage they are dealing and the various shield levels but for newer players this can be a difficult task. Providing a visual aid for such critical information we hope evens the playing field a bit and can provide accurate and actionable information that can be relayed to the whole squad. You can really call out that “they’re one!”.*



# AMMO & ATTACHMENTS

**Ammo Spawn rates**

* Energy ammo: reduced individual spawn rate
* Light & Heavy ammo: slight increase to individual spawn rate
* Shotgun & Sniper ammo: increased individual spawn rate



**Ammo Stack Changes**

* Light ammo stack size increased to 72 (was 60)
   * Individual brick size increased to 24 (was 20)
* Energy ammo stack size decreased to 54 (was 60)
   * Individual brick size decreased to 18 (was 20)
* Shotgun ammo stack size increased to 20 (was 16)
   * Individual brick size increased to 10 (was 8)

*Dev Note: Light ammo weapons have been overshadowed by our Heavy and Energy arsenal the last few seasons. With this set of changes we’re hoping the ammo economy for Light will improve their viability and earn back a place in player’s loadouts.* 



**Hop-ups**

* Disruptor Rounds removed from floor loot
* New Hop-Up: Gun Shield Generator
   * Usable by all LMGs (Spitfire, Rampage, L-STAR, Devotion)
   * When aiming down sights automatically deploy a frontal Gun Shield
   * Gun Shield absorbs 40 damage
   * Gun Shield is recharged 12 seconds after taking damage or breaking
   * Improves Gibraltar’s Gun Shield 
      * Gun Shield health increased to 75
      * Gun Shield recharge time remains the same as his passive



# WEAPONS

**Akimbo**

Dual wield two P2020s or two Mozambiques this season by finding and interacting with a second P2020 or Mozambique to automatically enter Akimbo mode. 

* Aiming tightens hipfire spread instead of looking down sights
* Attachments are mirrored to the second weapon
* Both P2020 and Mozambique are automatic in Akimbo
* Increased rate of fire 
* Longer reload times
* Magazine size is doubled 
* Optics are disabled while in Akimbo
* Toggle select fire to holster your second weapon and re-enable your optic. 



**LMGs**

* All LMGs now benefit from the Reverse Hipfire mechanic found on the Care Package Devotion
* New Hop-Up: Gun Shield Generator (see Hop-Ups section above)

*Dev Note: LMGs are great at suppressing enemies and unloading huge mags of consistent damage, but they can’t compete with our more aggressive weapon types in raw damage output so we’re trying new vectors of strength—defense and consistency. The Gun Shield Generator is intended to allow players to challenge higher DPS weapons in a new way that plays into their fantasy more than just increasing damage. While the Reverse Hipfire mechanic provides a more consistent close range option.*

  
**Alternator**

* Magazine size changes
   * Base: 19 (unchanged)
   * White: 23 (was 22)
   * Blue: 26 (was 25)
   * Purple/Gold: 28 (was 27)



**CAR**

* Magazine size changes
   * Base: 19 (unchanged)
   * White: 22 (was 21)
   * Blue: 24 (was 23)
   * Purple/Gold: 27 (was 26)



**Devotion (Care Package)**

* Empty reload speed decreased
* Gun Shield Generator added
* Reverse hip fire improved; shots needed for max hipfire reduced to 14 (was 21)



**Flatline**

* Magazine size changes
   * Base: 19 (was 20)
   * White: 23 (was 25)
   * Blue: 27 (was 28)
   * Purple/Gold: 29 (was 30)



**Havoc**

* Hipfire accuracy significantly reduced



**Hemlok**

* Burst Delay slightly increased
* Damage reduced to 19 (was 20)
* Magazine Size Reduction
   * Base: 18 (unchanged)
   * White: 21 (was 24)
   * Blue: 24 (was 27)
   * Purple/Gold: 30 (unchanged)

*Dev Note: Hemlock & Havoc have both been overperforming, these changes are intended to bring them more in line with the rest of the weapon roster.* 



**P2020 (Single)**

* Damage increased to 21 (was 18)
* Hammer Point damage decreased to 23 (was 27)
* Magazine size changes
   * Base: 10 (was 14)
   * White: 11 (was 16)
   * Blue: 12 (was 18)
   * Purple/Gold: 14 (was 21)



**Mozambique (Single)**

* Hammer Point Damage for a full blast reduced to 54 (was 60)
* Rate of fire significantly increased
* Shotgun Bolt rate of fire multiplier decreased at all levels



**Mastiff**

* Damage increased to 15 (was 11)
* Pellet count reduced to 6 (was 8)

https://preview.redd.it/massszf87vgd1.png?width=1736&format=png&auto=webp&s=35ba700ae8f15f2dafd03500720256f315e4d023

*Dev Note: Shotguns have been feeling inconsistent lately so we’re taking a swing at improving that consistency without just cranking the total damage up. Reducing pellet count and increasing the per pellet damage should increase the average damage dealt.*

  
**Peacekeeper**

* Damage increased per pellet to 11 (was 9)
* Pellet count reduced to 9 (was 11)
* Blast pattern shape changed

https://preview.redd.it/u4bboydb7vgd1.png?width=1752&format=png&auto=webp&s=9a6b3222d9eb7bf0098e92287a9b36439cdaf3fa



**R-301**

* Magazine size changes
   * Base: 21(was 18)
   * White: 23 (was 20)
   * Blue 28: (was 25)
   * Purple/Gold: 31 (was 28)



**RE-45**

* Magazine size changes
   * Base: 18 (was 16)
   * White: 20 (was 19)
   * Blue: 23 (was 22)
   * Purple/Gold: 26 (was 25)



**Rampage**

* Increase projectile size while Revved Up



# LEGENDS

**New Class Perks + Adjustments**

* Controller Legends
   * Class Perk - Zone Overcharge: extra shield capacity when playing in zone (see above)
   * QoL - Remote Pick-Up: remotely pick-up their undamaged Tacticals by looking back at them and pressing a button (see above)
* Recon Legends
   * Class Perk - Threat Vision: gain threat vision when aiming down sights (see above)
   * Survey Beacons: multiple updates (see above)

**Alter**

* Void Nexus
   * Channel time when knocked decreased to 2s (was 3s)
   * Chase portal duration decreased 8s (was 10s)
   * Chase portal opening delay increased to 8s (was 6s) 
   * Increased travel speed to void nexus by about 40% (was 1800) 
   * Ult cooldown reduced to 3 min (was 3.5m)
   * When knocked, you can travel to a friendly Void Nexus without looking at it by pressing character action (H key/D-pad down)

*Dev Note: When you're knocked, you're at your most vulnerable and taking time to locate an object in the world and look at it for a period of time with no way to defend yourself is both challenging and risky. These changes should make it easier for a knocked teammate to safely use the Void Nexus, and allow you to reset your squad quicker and more safely.*

* Removed option to press character action to destroy your own Void Nexus (H key/D-pad down)

*Dev note: It was a common misconception that destroying your own void nexus prevented people from following you. In actuality, it only prevented your teammates from using it. This feature was intended to be used only when Alter felt its placement was unsafe. In practice though, it was rarely used this way and mostly resulted in Alter destroying her own Void Nexus when trying to thank her teammates.*

* Upgrades: Level 2
   * Ult Cooldown: removed ( Level 2 )
   * NEW Ringmaster: gain access to Ring Consoles

https://preview.redd.it/fevovyuz7vgd1.png?width=2172&format=png&auto=webp&s=2025687aaf2d0c90934fe438c0f18fbb1e5479cc



**Ballistic**

* Whistler: lock-on time decreased to 0.1s (was 0.3s)

https://preview.redd.it/l4lnr6528vgd1.png?width=1407&format=png&auto=webp&s=92c54a7bcd3afbbf1ee37de2f4736be18c50dbcf

  


**Crypto**

* Surveillance Drone: cooldown decreased to 30s (was 40s)
* Upgrades
   * NEW: It’s called Off the Grid: Crypto becomes cloaked when in drone
      * While hidden from sight, Crypto’s cloaking will still emit a close-range cloaking sound to sus his location and ability scans will still reveal his location
      * Threat Vision related skills will not reveal Crypto
   * Improved Satellite Imagery: Ult now scans anyone it hits for 4s and will track through walls
   * Quick Ping: removed, improved handling now integrated into base kit

*Dev note: Crypto’s upgrades were looking pretty one-sided, so we’ve made changes at both tiers to rival the dominant choices with new options that should introduce some interesting gameplay potential. Crypto’s finally going Off the Grid; which should make players feel more safe playing in the drone and the improvement to satellite imagery gives lasting potential to follow up on your successful EMP blasts. We’ve also pushed the fun of a more responsive drone into every player’s hands.*

https://preview.redd.it/zccl19u78vgd1.png?width=2166&format=png&auto=webp&s=650818195fe200e3ccb1797dc94467bf3a9a7487



**Lifeline**

* Upgrade - Gold-Plated: replaced Gold EVO Cache with Battery

*Dev note: Lifeline has been showing some dominance in her recent resurgence, but the free level from the Gold EVO caches and the gold knockdown shield from her upgraded Ultimate were compounding her strength in a cheeky way; bypassing the effort to earn that final armor tier. We feel there’s enough power in guaranteeing the Gold Knockdown Shield to retain the golden girl without the free pass to max level.*

  
**Rampart**

* Sheila 
   * Ammo drains from pip charge with use
   * Maximum number of place turrets allowed is now 1
   * Need 1 PIP of Ultimate change to draw or place Sheila
   * No longer requires a full charge to equip
   * Now uses an Ammo-Style Ultimate model

*Dev note: Sheila isn’t as slept-on as she once was, but we were seeing some players struggle to micro-manage the cooldown of the Ultimate - given that you had to drain the ammo or plant it to not wind up accidentally drawing a Shiela with only a few bullets remaining. Now Sheila will work off an ammo model, similar to Vantage, and constantly refill ammo when not in use. This should let players worry less about tracking the remaining ammo in Sheila, keep the weapon in the action more reliably and allow Rampart to more freely place an extra turret for a teammate behind her walls without sacrificing her Ult.*

  
**Seer**

* Focus of Attention: healthbars persist for duration of Silence
* Heartbeat Sensor
   * Passive move speed has been increased to weapon sprint speed
   * Passive is now quieter when active
* Upgrades
   * Focus Scan: removed
   * NEW Split Focus: gain an additional Tac charge

*Dev note: In this Recon-focused season, we’re making some changes to Seer to pull back on some of the sluggish sticking points around using his passive and are adjusting his Tactical to still have a unique benefit with the addition of Player Healthbars this season. We’re also experimenting with giving Seer access to more utility with his Tactical with Split Focus. Now players will get to choose to opt into the longer range with the single all-or-nothing outcome, or gain the second charge with more chances to hit at the cost of overall silence time.*

https://preview.redd.it/ma5sgd8h8vgd1.png?width=2168&format=png&auto=webp&s=b618681e2daaa992f3fe47d6674256fe666ca30c

  
**Vantage**

* Echo Relocation: no longer requires LOS to Echo to launch
   * Can launch when LOS is blocked
   * Can now cancel the tac mid charge
   * Tac reticle will turn red when echo is behind you and you are launching
   * Will slide-around boxes and geometry as best it can to reach Echo
* Sniper’s Mark
   * 2nd Shot Multiplier is now 2.5x (was 2x)
   * Can hit ""Reload"" when in ult to use an Ult Accel
* Spotter's Lens
   * NEW Ranged Tracking
      * Waypoint on PING within Passive range will track enemy for 10s
      * Will not show within 100m (for each ally individually)
   * Recon Info
      * Added to all optics
      * Expanded passive scanning screen area to be more consistent
* Upgrade - Ult Reload: now also doubles Ult Accel use speed in addition to providing 2 extra bullets

*Dev Note: Vantage has a number of improvements to her kit this season to make her more effective at what she’s meant to do. Her Ult now secures more damage against weakened prey on its follow-up shots. Her Tac is now more reliable to allow for easier to reach Echo in complex areas. And her passive has expanded to all optics, making it a useful part of her kit regardless of scope and without having to go unarmed. Additionally, her passive has a new tracking feature when pinging a target in your sights at long range—allowing Vantage and her allies to track the target at a distance more easily.*

  
**Wattson**

* Upgrades
* Power Pylon: now regenerates shield charge
* Split Current: removed
* Emergency Power - Added
* Increases Shield Regen Rate of Interception Pylon

*Dev Note: While the Split Circuit upgrade harkened back to the old times and had interesting promise, most players found success bunkering around one stronger pylon, rather than trying to hold space with two and the upgrade was heavily outmatched. These changes aim to look into the shield generator aspect of Wattson’s Ult and the potential for either a faster reset or more resilient ultimate.*

*Dev Notes:The goal is to reset players to a tier that suits them based on their performance in the Ranked League of the previous season when the new season begins. This allows them to start battling from a rank that better suits their skill level while protecting newcomers and low-ranked players. Additionally, a portion of the achievements of high-ranked players who performed well in the previous season is retained, allowing them to compete against opponents of similar skill levels right from the start of the new season.*,,,,,,,,

I used to play Pubg a lot a few years ago until they sold there company who (in my oppinion) fucked it up. especially by putting bots in the game wich I understand was a attempt to fill up the lobby's more. 
In a few months there somehow seemed to be more bots then players and I did'nt have the feeling of ""being the best"" anymore.
Since then I have not been as invested in any other battle-royale games. (Fuck Fortnite)

Also some female characters in the game have a huge dumptruck so that helps too.

**Gameplay**

* **Remove or nerf aim punch -** The aim punch (aka flinch) makes the gunplay extremely frustrating as once your shields are broken you are no longer in control of where you are aiming. This gives the player who broke the other person’s shield first a huge advantage as the other player will not be able to aim back effectively. This counteracts the game's long time to kill as it is often a battle to break the other person’s shield first as the artificial momentum given by flinch will likely decide the fight. 
* **Remove or nerf bullet slow -** There is no reason that players should be forced into a crouch state because they could not predict they would be hit by a bullet the instant they attempted to slide. This is a movement based shooter. I don't understand why there would be a mechanic that reduces your sprint speed by 40%. 
* **Reduce visual clutter or make a normal vs minimal setting -** The amount of muzzle flash, bullet tracers, damage effects, blood splatter, etc. in the game make it incredibly difficult to see the target at times. This especially impacts MNK players as aim assist is still active through visual clutter giving controller players an advantage. 
* **Balance aim assist on PC -** As shown by the R5 statistics, aim assist is simply unbalanced. Aim assist can be easily balanced by playtesting new rotational aim assist values. Reducing the .4 to .3 would likely be enough to make MNK and controller accuracy comparable but testing using 1v1 scenarios and or R5 itself should be done.  
* **Remove screen shake from non damaging items -** Like aim punch this mechanic can be extremely frustrating in gunfights. Anyone who has played mixtape enough has experienced this many times with care packages dropping.

**Matchmaking/Game Modes**

* **Separate premade parties from solo q matchmaking for pubs -** 3 randoms are never going to beat a 50k kill on each legend 3 stack sweating in pubs. Matchmaking should also be more strict so that 3 super sweats partied together cannot steamroll easy lobbies just so that their queue times are short.
* **Bring back straight shot/3 strikes more frequently or add to a BR mixtape playlist -** Yes I know the game is too dead to fill these LTM playlists right now but if you actually make it good with all of these changes it won’t be.
* **Enable us to mess around during queue times -** Playing in the firing range, 1v1’ing teammates, parkour maps, etc. this would allow for more fun to be had while waiting and would also allow for better matchmaking as players would remain engaged while waiting in the queue. 

**Misc**

* **Fix frame based issues in the game -** You cannot properly bhop on 144fps, 240fps, 300fps. These are extremely common fps values as they correlate with monitor refresh rates. Not a lot of players even know that this is a problem and it is just one of many frame based issues. 

**Fun**

* **Enable the community to help you -** R5R devs have created maps and gamemodes that have captivated 10s of thousands of players. If given the opportunity to do so in retail apex the community could keep the game fresh and exciting for itself.
*  **Add more fun gameplay -** Throwing Newcastle q or flying crypto drones through wraith ports, stuff like this that is silly and fun to mess around with for teams.

**Ranked**

* **Increased required level to play -** Level 50 required to play ranked, Level 100 to play in diamond and above. ",698,241,1721687013,Negative,0.743,neutral,0.396

1crnfig,apexlegends,Solos confirms it again - Horizon is broken,"90% of my opponents are Horizon with 4K, triple PRED badge and 20 bomb. Of course, the badges themselves don't have to mean much at first... but then in the gunfight it turns out that Horizon isn't played so often for nothing.

Her Q is still completely broken. Free escape, free healing, free highground, almost impossible to hit in the lift (I know, all esports players here will write how super easy it is to oneclip triple PREDS in the lift), landing without a movement penalty, crazy bunny hopping and a strong ult (We don't even want to talk about the silent landings and lifts).

Horizon is and remains the strongest legend in the game and it is incomprehensible to me how she continues to remain almost untouched. Anything that makes her broken will NOT be nerfed.   
  
Horizon is the legend that frustrates the most. Her movement mechanics break the gameplay. There have to be drawbacks to her abilities, just like almost every other legend. No heal in the lift, no soft landing, much slower lift, no movement in the lift - SOMETHING that also limits her. See Pathfinder, Valk, or Wraith - Path became a flying refrigerator, Valk has lost 2 engines and has a leak in the tank and Wraith has to officially register her Q the day before. **Nerf Horizon!!!**

**Edit: The amount of people who write that it's a skill issue and think her Q isn't broken is ridiculous. I've been playing since S0, 60K lifetime kills with a 3.5KD and 10 seasons earned double master... Hitting a casual Horizon in the lift is no problem. It's about the good players who autistically exploit her movement. The verticality of the lift and the associated movement skills are simply too strong.

1emfuxy,apexlegends,health bars arent healthy,"I was willing to give the health bars some slack and wait, but as i feared. Its busted as hell.

  
First issue is it nerfs seer EVEN MORE.  Everything now his tact does, someone else can do but better. And seeing how much hp your enemies has for 8 seconds WOULD be important; if it wasnt for the fact that every legend can see your hp by grazing you with a bullet. One of seers selling points are gone, and at this point, his tact is now just a combination of other tacts, but worse. 

  
2d is it gives you wallhacks. im  behind a tree. Beam. Im in your smoke but yo uhit me? Now I can see you. See the issue. Its just wall hacks, and its annoying. Admittedly its not strong, but its severse enough to be recognised.

The main issue is the info you get. In apex, knowledge is power. And the fact that every legend can see how much hp you have is powerful knowledge. Its too much info given to everone that ruins some game sense of knowing if someone is low, since you can graze them, and now you know their hp. Its frustrating knowing a third party can hit you, and that could be all the info they need to full send you. Its annoying as hell, and removes skill from the game.

  
Overall, ge tthe health bars out of here. They are NOT welcome.

EDIT: Clearly some people dont know the iussue at hand, so lemme elaborate.

These hp bars give SO MUCH info. Not just their helath, but also how much heals they have if your smart. Lets say you run out of heals, get hit, and the enemy notices 'hey, they aren't healing!!!"" Thats an instant push, and theres no question. 

Or what if they aren't fully healed, and you tag them??? Before you would need to be more careful since you dont know their hp. Now you can fully calculate it without issue. Y

Yall are thinking at surface level, and so your not seeing the issue at hand. Think deeper!!!! IF you think deeper, you can get so much info from this that you just wouldn't be able to get before. And lemme tell you. Diamonds+ WILL be abusing this to their fullest.

1em2p8n,apexlegends,The Problem With The Health Bar,"https://reddit.com/link/1em2p8n/video/25fe4t1a56hd1/player

Health bar has given me wall hacks 3 times today already. Its a very unnecessary addition imo and it needs to be removed or at least reworked so people can't do this.

EDIT: I'm seeing in the comments that this is somehow boiling down to a MNK vs Roller debate. Guys, nobody should die by getting perfectly tracked without the shooter having LOS.

People are acting like this benefits MNK therefore, it's good. It benefits controller just as much, but the point is, it removes integrity from the game. Kill the wallhack health bar, nerf AA so you cant track people you can't see.",677,231,1723004610,Negative,0.692,neutral,0.761

People have been beaming at superhuman levels lately. The last 2-3 seasons have been the worst but this seasons even seems a notch ahead. 

Check your death recaps, I’m getting fully head shotted from miles away with weapons that shouldn’t be able to do it. On top of that I hear the sound of a r301, hemlock, or flatline using the single fire with rapid fire chronus mod all the time now. Especially in solos/ranked. If you didn’t know, when you put these weapons on single fire and use your rapid fire chronus mod, you get a fire rate that is faster than the guns normal fire rate as well as you get way less recoil due to it being single fire.  You can CLEARLY hear the difference in how the guns sound. It’s such a frustrating experience to play online games now because you just know a lot of the players have an unfair advantage. And before you say “it’s not actually that bad” I saw a tweet with a Amazon page of the chronus zen product and it had “30,000+ bought in the last month” so yeah, it’s bad. And it’s especially bad in competitive games like apex legends. 

It’s getting to the point where I’m about to give up on online competitive games until the chronus issue gets resolved. Please for the love of GOD do something about these individuals that have ruined gaming for the rest of us. ",651,411,1715378842,Negative,0.93,anger,0.469

Since the major backlash apex received when they released this skin that was 160$ (entire collection event) . This skin is probably never coming back right ? Since they can’t really bring it into the “recolor store” because the 50 exotic shards isn’t equal to the value you had to pay to get it originally and players who unironically did buy it would be upset it’s being sold for half the price . 

Unlikely they would ever put it in the heirloom store as it would be the only one of its kind and I don’t think anyone is wasting heirloom shards on a pk skin lol 

So what exactly is the story gonna be on this skin lol? Is it forever gonna be a skin you could only get one time and it’ll never return ? Not that I’d want it or anything . I just genuinely think it’s interesting to wonder what this skin and its history will be . And if instead of ever trying to return this skin they just recolor it again and put it in the exotic shop. But even then the players who bought the 160$ one would be mad there’s a recolor of a skin they payed 160$ for that’s available for 40-50",632,119,1731400026,Negative,0.672,anger,0.82

# Bans:

During season 21, and from the 7th of May to the 5th of August, 3986 bans were issued for players holding Master and Pred ranks. 1466 were Preds at the time of the ban, and the other 2520 were Masters.

* Split 1: 949 Preds, 1263 Masters
* Split 2: 517 Pred, 1257 Masters

# Bans per day:

On average, 50 bans were issued each day for Master/Pred players, with 207 bans in one day as the peak.

https://preview.redd.it/ksdvjks2jugd1.png?width=571&format=png&auto=webp&s=86d983886891cb1725a8aecfbcf8a474c6665663

# Account level of the banned accounts:

On average, the level of the banned accounts is 378. Only 14.4% of them are below the level 50. While 54.7% are between 50 and 500. 31% of the banned players are Prestige (above 500).

# Takeaways:

* Cheaters are running rampant in rank, they are achieving the highest ranks before being removed from the game. They are being banned too late, after the damage is done, throwing the competitive integrity out of the window.
* In Split 1, a total of 949 cheaters made it to Pred, this is more than the actual number of Preds (750). This translates to PC lobbies being a cheater fest. 
* Those are the cheaters themselves, the amount of players who were boosted by them is mind-boggling.
* Those are the cheaters who got caught, the number of cheaters running unpunished is beyond estimation.
* This doesn't include Cronus/XIM users as the use of such devices is yet to result in bans.
* The competitive integrity of Ranked above Diamond is jeopardized.

# NEW LEGEND: ALTER

Alter is an agent of chaos, primarily concerned with having fun and bringing about the end of the world. Everything is a game to her, and she is always looking for an advantage. Her kit adds an entirely unique dimension to the Apex Games, allowing her to create void passages through geo or escape through the Void to her Nexus when her enemies believe they have the upper hand. Her ability to craft unsuspecting rotations through the world will sow new levels of disorder in the ring and she can’t wait to watch the whole place burn.

&#x200B;

For more details on our newest and most devious Legend, check out our Highlights Blog. Read more about her abilities below.

&#x200B;

**PASSIVE: GIFT FROM THE RIFT**

Can remotely interact with a deathbox to claim one item. Cannot be a shield core.

&#x200B;

**TACTICAL: VOID PASSAGE**

Creates a portal passageway through a surface.

&#x200B;

**ULTIMATE: VOID NEXUS**

Create a regroup point that all allies can remotely interact with to open a phase tunnel back to that location.

&#x200B;

**UPGRADES**

# SOLOS TAKEOVER

In case you missed it, Solos will be taking over Duos from May 7, 2024 to June 24, 2024. We’ve taken aspects of some of our most popular modes and integrated them to keep things interesting: use your Battle Sense to detect nearby enemies, tear things up with pre-kitted weapons and attachments, and keep the fight going with auto heal and Second Chance mechanics.

### 

# PATCH NOTES

### BALANCE UPDATES

**Care Package**

* Wingman returns to the floor
   * Projectile size reduced to pre-care package values
   * Damage reduced to 45 (was 50)
   * Skullpiercer Elite removed
   * Hipfire accuracy reduced
   * Now takes Boosted Loader Hop-Up
   * No longer takes magazines as an attachment
* Devotion enters the Care Package
   * NEW Reverse Hipfire: sustained hipfire will tighten accuracy instead of widen
   * Damage increased to 16 (was 15)
   * Magazine size increased to 54 (was 48 at purple)
   * Reserve Ammo: 324
   * Empty reload time significantly reduced

**Gold Weapons Rotation**

* Nemesis Burst AR, Triple-Take, Peacekeeper, Prowler PDW, Longbow DMR

**Guaranteed Weapons out of Loot Bins**

* The first loot bin opened by an unarmed player will always contain a weapon

*Dev Note: Bringing knuckles to a gunfight isn’t the most engaging gameplay, so we’re improving weapon acquisition consistency in the early game. When completely unarmed, opening a bin will guarantee at least a low tier weapon.*

**Retrieving Banners from Death Boxes**

* Collecting a banner will no longer lock the player out of critical gameplay actions
   * Running, shooting, punching and reviving will all break out of the banner collect animation while still registering as a successful collection
   * Players can immediately interact with a Death Box a second time while the animation is playing or continue holding the interact button to collect *and* enter a Death Box in one flow

*Dev Note: It’s happening, it’s finally happening! I’ve died, you’ve died, we’ve all died trying to help our allies get back in the fight, but at least now we can’t blame grabbing the banner! Collecting banners is a positive action in Apex and for too long we’ve punished that action with a brief moment of pure helplessness. We’re putting your gun quite literally back in your hands, so get out there and save some Octanes and Wraiths!*

**Survival Items + Support Bins**

* Survival items now only spawn from a support bin’s tray if the team is in need

*Dev Note: Survival items have been feeling abundant lately so we’re reducing their frequency in support bins by only spawning them when players meet specific requirements (like needing a Mobile Respawn Beacon when you’ve got eliminated allies)*

&#x200B;

### WEAPONS & ATTACHMENTS

**30-30 Repeater**

* Skullpiercer Hop-Up removed

*Dev Note: The 30-30 has been dominating the mid-long range for a few seasons and our recent adjustments weren’t quite enough to dethrone it. Removing the Skullpiercer should create some space for other Marksman and Sniper rifles to shine.*

**Charge Rifle**

* ADS recoil improved and stabilized

*Dev Note: The Charge Rifle remains a high risk-reward weapon, however the risk slightly outweighs the reward. We’ve taken a smoothing pass at its recoil so it shouldn’t be quite so unwieldy when firing.*

**Longbow DMR**

* Skullpiercer Hop-Up removed
* Barrel Stabilizer attachment removed
* Base recoil significantly improved
* Projectile gravity reduced
* ADS in and out time reduced

*Dev Note: We’ve always considered the Longbow a great entry level sniper that’s easy to run. Over time, we’ve come to realize that being a good entry level weapon and requiring lots of attachments to come online are at odds with one another. Simplifying the Longbow’s loot chase to make it more base level approachable is intended to improve its early game effectiveness and overall consistency as a sniper.*

**Triple-Take**

* Now takes Boosted Loader Hop-Up

*Dev Note: The Triple-Take is a strong weapon on paper, but it can feel a bit sluggish to maximize damage output. Providing quick reloads and extra ammo in the mag allows players to keep pressuring for longer with more chances to punish.*

**Hop-Ups**

* Skullpiercer removed from the loot pool
* Boosted Loader added to the loot pool
   * Reloading while near empty will speed up reloading and overload the next magazine with extra rounds

**1x Digital Threat Optic**

* Removed from loot pool and all locked set weapons

*Dev Note: The Digi represents a sharp power spike in Apex—a single loot item that both counters and synergies with a specific Legend. Its power ebbs and flows with the Legend meta in a way that proves very difficult to tune. We’re giving the 1x Digi a hiatus while we investigate healthier optic based perks.*

&#x200B;

### LEGENDS

**Ash**

* Arc Snare
   * Changed to left-hand cast
   * No longer stows weapons or interrupts consumable use when launching
* Phase Breach: inspired by some Alter tech, nearby enemies will be highlighted for players traveling through the Void

*Dev Note*: *It’s about time, huh? Allowing Ash to fire her Arc Snare with her off-hand has been something we’ve wanted to do for a while now. Holstering and redrawing her weapon to use the snare put Ash at a disadvantage in combat and minimized a lot of her play options. Ash should now be able to be much more active with her snare and apply pressure more aggressively when successful.*

&#x200B;

**Ballistic**

* Whistler: damage from a planted smart bullet increased to 10 (was 5)
* Upgrades
   * Care Package Insight: removed
   * NEW Sling-Shot: improves Ballistic’s base sling weapon to a blueset at Level 2 and a purpleset at Level 3

*Dev Note: We’re replacing a lackluster perk with something more interesting, especially for those Ballistic players that like tapping into their sling weapons in non-Ult scenarios. Three Tac related upgrades is plenty, let’s make some room for that third weapon.*

**Breakout: Level 2**

**Lasting Bullet**

Smart Bullet duration in-world is tripled.

**Care Package Insight**

Reveal Care Packages. 

&#x200B;

**Upheaval: Level 2**

**Lasting Bullet**

Smart Bullet duration in-world is tripled.

**Sling-Shot**

Sling weapon levels up with each upgrade selection.

&#x200B;

**Bloodhound**

* Beast of the Hunt
   * Cooldown increased to 4m (was 3m)
   * Knocks with Ult active no longer extend duration
* Upgrades: Level 3
   * Tactical Cooldown: removed
   * Taste of Blood: buffed HP gain on knock to 50 (was 25)
   * NEW Long Hunt: knocks extend Beast of the Hunt duration

*Dev Note: Beast of the Hunt has a lot of power baked into it considering perfect vision through smoke, increased move speed, and a generous extension timer. We wanted to break that down to see if players lean into a specific playstyle and ax the uninteresting hidden power of a decreased Tac cooldown. Bloodhound synergizes very well with two of the most popular Legends at the comp level, but we want to be mindful of their appeal across skill bands. We’re not doing anything big to this approachable Legend until we gauge their place at the top-end in a digi free world.*

**Breakout: Level 3**

**Taste of Blood**

Gain 25 hp on knocks while Ultimate is active.

**Tactical Cooldown**

\-5s Tac Cooldown

&#x200B;

**Upheaval: Level 3**

**Long Hunt**

Knocks extend Beast of the Hunt duration.

**Taste of Blood**

Gain 50 hp on knocks while Ultimate is active.

&#x200B;

**Catalyst**

* Piercing Spikes
   * Cooldown decreased to 20s (was 25s)
   * Long Cast upgrade integrated into base Tactical
* Dark Veil
   * Dark Veil length increased to 45m (was 40m)
* Upgrades
   * Long Cast: removed
   * Long Veil: moved to Level 2
   * NEW Ferro-Door: fully rebuild and reinforce missing doors with Passive.

*Dev Note*: *Catalyst could use some love after her Ult nerfs, and Sister Spikes needed some competition. Hopefully making Tac charges more available with a baseline cooldown buff and creating a situationally strong alternative via passive upgrade helps strike a balance. Now that the Ult upgrades are decoupled, there are some difficult choices to make at both levels that we suspect are influenced by match flow. Will you hunker down with a friendly zone pull, or will you need an upgraded wall to help with rotations?*

**Breakout: Level 2**

**Sister Spikes**

Increase max number of active Spikes by one.

**Long Cast**

Increase Spike throw range by 40%.

&#x200B;

**Upheaval: Level 2**

**Long Veil**

Increase Ultimate length by 15m.

**Sister Spikes**

Increase max number of active Spikes by one.

&#x200B;

**Breakout: Level 3**

**Resilient Veil**

Increase Ultimate lifetime by 5s

**Long Veil**

Increase Ultimate length by 15m

&#x200B;

**Upheaval: Level 3**

**Ferro-Door**

Fully rebuild and reinforce missing doors with Passive.

**Resilient Veil**

Increase Ultimate lifetime by 5s.

&#x200B;

**Caustic**

* Gas damage and slow now stops immediately after Caustic's squad is eliminated
* Gas damage ramps from 4 → 10 max (was 5 → uncapped), damage on knocked players down to flat 4 (was 5)

**Conduit**

* Radiant Transfer
   * Can no longer target a Revenant while Forged Shadows is active
   * When Revenant activates Forged Shadows, any temporary shield generation ends immediately. Revenant will keep any temporary shields generated before activating his Ultimate.
* Upgrades
   * Battery Collection: removed
   * NEW Battpack: can stack up to 3 Shield Batteries per inventory slot (doesn’t stack with Gold Backpack)

*Dev Note*: *Conduit maintains a healthy pick rate and has cemented herself as a strong Support pick even after her last round of nerfs. We don’t want to hit her effectiveness as a Legend that pushes the tempo in combat. This is a targeted nerf to one of her synergies that felt more exploitable than we’d like.*

**Breakout: Level 2**

**Battery Collection**

See Battery Count of death boxes.

**Bigger Jam**

Jammer damage radius increased by 20%.

&#x200B;

**Upheaval: Level 2**

**Battpack**

Stack up to 3 batteries per inventory slot.

**Bigger Jam**

Jammer damage radius increased by 20%.

&#x200B;

**Crypto**

* Neurolink
   * Network Traffic upgrade now integrated into base kit
   * Squadcount banners are now visible anytime the drone is in a deployed state
* Upgrades: Level 2
   * Tac & Ultimate Cooldowns: removed
   * Network Expansion: moved to Level 2
   * NEW Quick Ping: improved drone handling (faster accel/decel)
* Upgrades: Level 3
   * NEW Satellite Imagery: drone scan persists for an additional 1.5s
   * NEW Hackathon: cut the drone cooldown in half, gain a speed boost anytime he uses his Ult or the drone is destroyed

*Dev Note*: *Crypto’s upgrades at the start of Season 20 left a lot to be desired. We hope this suite of changes resonates with a couple different playstyle types—particularly when it comes to players’ affinity to pilot the drone more actively vs. passively.*

**Breakout: Level 2**

**Tactical Cooldown+**

Reduce Tactical cooldown by 10 seconds.

**Ultimate Cooldown**

Reduce Ultimate cooldown by 20%.

&#x200B;

**Upheaval: Level 2**

**Network Expansion**

Passive & Ult range increased by 25%.

**Quick Transmission**

Improved drone handling.

&#x200B;

**Breakout: Level 3**

**Network Expansion**

Passive & Ult range increased by 25%.

**Network Traffic**

Deploying the drone calls out squads in the area.

&#x200B;

**Upheaval: Level 3**

**Hackathon**

Double drone recharge rate; gain speed boost when it explodes.

**Satellite Imagery**

Drone scan persists for 1.5 seconds.

&#x200B;

**Fuse**

* Upgrades
   * Big Bang: removed
   * NEW Ring Master: gain access to Ring Consoles
   * Scar Tissue: 
      * Simplified and buffed damage mitigation to remove lingering burn effects
      * Take a flat 20 damage when crossing The Motherlode instead of 37 (50% of 75 hp) over time
   * Wreckless: fixed explosive damage mitigation not being applied on continuous Knuckle Cluster hits (should only take about 32 damage from a full Knuckle Cluster now with Wreckless)

*Dev Note*: *Fuse is destruction and chaos. The goal of these changes, whether it be a new strategic-level upgrade or a simplification of a convoluted damage model, is to bring some method to the madness.*

**Breakout: Level 2**

**Big Bang**

See ordnance through walls & death boxes.

**Scar Tissue**

Take 50% damage and ignore slow effects of The Motherlode.

&#x200B;

**Upheaval: Level 2**

**Ring Master**

Gain access to Ring Consoles.

**Scar Tissue**

Take 20 damage and ignore slow effects from The Motherlode.

&#x200B;

**Newcastle**

* Mobile Shield: throw anim speed increased (\~2.5x faster)
* Castle Wall
   * Will now destroy incoming projectiles headed towards the front of the wall while energized. It will not destroy projectiles fired from behind the wall nor bombardments from other Legend’s Ultimate projectiles.
   * Castle Wall energized duration increased to 1m (was 30s)
* Upgrade - Stronghold: increased energized duration to 3m (was 2.5m)

*Dev Note*: *The Castle Wall’s in-game strength rarely matches the grandeur of its presentation. More often than not, the wall serves as a grenade beacon to surrounding threats knowing that Newcastle just jumped to an ally in distress. An Ultimate-level wall should not fail as much as it does, especially on a Support Legend that’s built around turning the tide when his squad starts losing the advantage. The wall now requires more calculated counterplay and makes the Stronghold upgrade a more compelling option. We were also finding the long wind-up when tossing his Mobile Shield left him pretty vulnerable trying to get back to his weapon, so we’ve sped up the animation to let him be more reactive with it.*

&#x200B;

**Octane**

* Upgrades
   * Wreckless: removed
   * Mad Hops moved to Level 2
   * Thick Skin: now Level 2 and 3, updated to take 5 less Stim damage to reflect that it can be selected twice (was -25%)

*Dev Note*: *Octane has a “Plus Ultra'' tattoo, so we shouldn’t inhibit his ability to double down on his tac or ult. While Wreckless was thematically fun, Octane already has one of the best forms of explosive damage mitigation that’s less hidden: stim away.*

**Breakout: Level 2**

**Thick Skin**

\-25% Stim damage

**Wreckless**

\-50% Explosive damage

&#x200B;

**Upheaval: Level 2**

**Mad Hops**

Gain an extra Launch Pad charge.

**Thick Skin**

Take 5 less Stim damage.

&#x200B;

**Breakout: Level 3**

**Mad Hops**

Gain an extra Launch Pad charge.

**Airborne Agility**

   * Falling Stars: Pylons will stop spawning Arc Stars when her squad is eliminated
   * Split Circuit: no longer reduces shield regen capacity

* Into the Void and Dimensional Rift: nearby enemies will be highlighted for players traveling through the Void

&#x200B;

* No tuning changes to be made to ranked scoring for the launch of Upheaval

* Changed the way players opt-in to the DX12 beta: if you're playing via the DirectX 12 beta now, the launch argument ""-eac\_launcher\_settings SettingsDX12.json"" should be changed to ""-anticheat\_settings=SettingsDX12.json""

1gs5bae,apexlegends,Why remove the only counters to the support meta?,"This patch is just weird.

It's nice to give all these cool buffs to Supports to make them more viable again, but why did they remove the only counters to them?

Damage aside, Crypto EMP should disable all shields, full stop. Why did they remove this right as they give supports crazy shield uptime with Gibby bubble, Newcastle shield/wall, and Lifeline ult?

The balance just doesn't make sense. They should've left at least *some* counterplay.

Maggie ball should take down shields and walls too. Why did they remove this?

Also everyone hates on Seer, but his tactical should cancel revives again. It's yet another removed counter that adds depth and would make more of the roster viable. Nobody plays Seer, they need to fix the issue of legends with super low pickrates.

Horizon ult should damage Newcastle/Rampart walls and maybe even shields. Another thing they removed by nerfing Horizon ult.

Why make Newcastle's ult just do what Wattson ult does?

You can't even shoot through these unbreakable shields. Like Rampart's Shiela could really mess up a Newcastle. But they remove that too?

Unbreakable shields with insane uptime?? Did they even playtest this??

Ults should counter ults. There's supposed to be some risk/reward with stacking all of a certain class, especially 3 shield-based Supports. Put all your eggs into the Support basket? You get good resets/uptime, but you risk all of you getting countered by anti-shield stuff. That's what balance is.

But with currently no good counters to the Support meta, you're basically forced to play it or you're at a disadvantage.

I really hope they bring some things back in line next split.",619,182,1731701001,Negative,0.8,disgust,0.729

1d30v9r,valorant,Reyna is a failure of game design,"Reyna is poorly designed in Valorant and doesn't teach players how to play the game properly, leading to a high amount of Reyna mains in mid-high elo with the game sense of a bronze player. In this essay i will... etc etc

**The only lesson to be learned from your mistakes playing Reyna is that you didn't get the kill**



1. **Reyna does not teach players to position well**

Imagine this scenario where, on round start, a defender runs it down B long on bind looking for a pick and runs into the entire enemy team.



https://preview.redd.it/itb7rjtij93d1.png?width=256&format=png&auto=webp&s=014c7a78036772c02a4c5c31d116d240483ee359

Your average scenario here with almost any agent is that you run out into a 1v5 and die. You'd probably think to yourself ""wow all 5 of them were there, that was a dumb spot to stand. I should play further back so I can escape or get a teammate to double peek with me and use util to secure.""

Now let's swap that out for Reyna.



https://preview.redd.it/mj45oq5xj93d1.png?width=196&format=png&auto=webp&s=eebb66eab754fd9aa19c11a82baa085ad7b83709

Reyna runs out, sees 5 enemies and dies, but instead the lesson learned is

**""My aim was bad, I would've been fine if I got a kill.""**

Reyna will then try the same strategy again, and when she gets a kill she is rewarded and her behaviour is reinforced by dismissing and retreating back to site.



**2. Reyna does not teach players how to effectively use utility for anyone other than herself**



https://preview.redd.it/dyvll0njl93d1.png?width=292&format=png&auto=webp&s=eb8cb060f386c66c2cf894934bb6c329d58722f6

Reyna's only situational piece of utility is a near-sight blind. She is the only character in the entire game that has a castable blind with **NO** downsides. Every single other ability in the game that blinds **affects your  teammates**. It's also one of 2 blinds in the entire game that **goes through walls**. If you throw a skye flash directly out into the middle of a fight or throw your omen blind from the backline you could blind your whole team and lose the fight.

Picture this scenario on Ascent A-site. Attacker team is doing a full push against 3 defenders on A.



https://preview.redd.it/0hmt91xsm93d1.png?width=375&format=png&auto=webp&s=39208c9ae239c788a6b611aeba6acc96c8302fa1

If omen misuses his blind here, he blinds the Jett playing dice, but also blinds his Deadlock and Clove. This puts the attackers at a massive disadvantage. Omen's team loses the push and Omen gets flamed for team flashing. Omen, who wants to avoid this in the future, learns from his mistake. He now knows that he needs to stand off to the side, or be aware of where his teammates are standing when he throws his blind.

Now we swap omen out for Reyna



https://preview.redd.it/0o1eiqwin93d1.png?width=271&format=png&auto=webp&s=434d197e7ce86b471bdef99ea5e1ee5b2c590fe5

Reyna can throw her blind anywhere, in any situation. It blinds anyone who can see it from any range. Reyna's team pushes the site, and if Reyna and her team dies her only lesson to be learned again is

**""My aim was bad, I would've been fine if I got a kill.""**

**3. Reyna does not teach players how to effectively use ultimate abilities**

Every single ultimate ability in this game **except for Reyna's** has a set of use case scenarios, and a set of non-use case scenarios. For example, you wouldn't phoenix ult in the middle of site, you'd get punished. You wouldn't use your kj ult in mid, you'd get punished. Reyna's ultimate is the only ultimate in the entire game that can be used effectively on round start **every time it's available.** There is no downside to using the Reyna ult, you cannot disadvantage or kill your teammates with the Reyna ult, you cannot put yourself at a disadvantage with the Reyna ult. You cannot waste the Reyna ult by any measure other than inactivity. The only lesson to be learned from dying and losing the Reyna ult is, again:

**""My aim was bad, I would've been fine if I got a kill.""**



**4. Reyna does not teach players about trade opportunities**

Reyna's dismiss and heal mechanics effectively allow her to cancel or heavily mitigate any trade opportunities presented to her enemies.

In this scenario on Split's mail/heaven area, lets pretend it's pistol round and everyone here has a ghost and no armor. Fade has swung into the Harbor. Fade gets the jump on Harbor and although Harbor manages to heavily tag the Fade, she secures the kill on him. As soon as this happens Gekko, who is nearby is able to quickly swing into position before the Fade is ready and secure the kill, trading out his teammate and securing the round. If Gekko is faster and both players are able to fight Fade together, she is very likely to still lose, even if she kills the Harbor. Fade has learned a valuable lesson in that if she is taking a fight, she needs to be prepared for someone else to swing her and take measures, such as backing off the angle and re-positioning, using dog to stop the trade, or playing a safer angle to begin with. If Fade takes damage in a fight, she's less likely to win the next fight and will likely be traded out. Now lets swap Fade out for Reyna:



https://preview.redd.it/atvodso5r93d1.png?width=301&format=png&auto=webp&s=50dafcbcfccb20ba05780b14cccfd2cec73ce700



Again, lets pretend it's pistol round and all 3 players have a ghost. Reyna pushes and while Harbor manages to heavily tag her, Reyna secures the kill. Reyna immediately activates her heal and is suddenly swung by Gekko. She now has more health than she had when she was fighting Harbor, and is able to secure the kill on Gekko as well. Reyna does not have to worry about being tagged and easily traded out on low-hp, and therefore does not need to have a plan to disengage. If Gekko is able to swing before Harbor is killed, as long as Reyna gets the kill on Harbor, she is able to dismiss and disengage from the fight and cancel the trade for free. If Reyna loses this fight, the only lesson to be learned is, again:

**""My aim was bad, I would've been fine if I got a kill.""**



So where does this leave players that only play Reyna? They've learned in almost every situation that their aim was poor and that they just needed to secure the kill to win. Every win condition in Valorant is getting the kill. There are no nuances or complex mechanics to interact with in this game **as long as you get the kill**. You do not need to perfect your utility usage and site takes **as long as you get the kill.** You don't need to worry about being traded **as long as you get the kill**.

**What are the consequences of this?**

We've seen from the above examples that Reyna is far too easy and far too forgiving to players, and while other players using different agents are climbing the ranks learning a wide variety of skills such as effective utility usage, strategy, positioning, teamwork and other meta-knowledge, Reyna players are learning that their only mistake was not getting the kill.

Thank you for listening to my TED talk

**tl;dr reyna as an agent does not have to interact with almost any of the complex systems and strategies of Valorant and people that only play Reyna are not given equal learning opportunities to their peers, only developing their aim leaving their game sense in the gutter.**",4496,853,1716947529,Negative,0.891,disgust,0.296

Sorry in advance for any grammatical, punctual errors and so on and so forth because it’s hard for me to text, and I’m a little bit of emotional rn. 
So what was that dream? To become a pro player. For the most of you it may sound silly, and childish, but for me it was a brightly burning passion, to which I dedicated myself with a whole heart. I love Valorant and everything about it. I love E-sports, I love agents, I love in-game mechanics, even movement. Everything for me is perfect, but this doesn’t matter anymore. 
The reason why I’m writing this is because since I was born I had a disease that caused an irreversible damage to my eyes, and I’m partially disabled, but despite of that I was able to play like a normal person, without any trouble, till the 21 of September of this year hit. I got another kind of disease that affected my right eye, and the center of it is in a kind of blur, so it makes it so I can’t aim in game at all. I just cannot see. 
I know that I could write 3+ paragraphs about my journey, love, and burning passion to it, but I think for everyone who decided to read this epitaph of my dream is way too much yapping. 
Have a great day, pursue your dreams at any cost if it makes your heart burn with passion, and goodbye Valorant, I love you ",4236,182,1727262269,Positive,0.669,sadness,0.944

I was playing unrateds with a couple friends, one is brand-new to the game, so I was basically trying to explain to them what his skills do during the game and just trying give calls throughout the game. Enemy team had an asc3 Reyna popping off so I started sweating it a bit to try making the game close. Enemy Reyna started giving me passive-aggressive vibes in all chat saying ""nice immo buddy lol"" whenever they'd kill me but I tried to genuinely be nice about it and told them they were really good and could easily get one too. We ended up winning 13-12 with my newbie friend getting the last kill and everyone getting super hyped about it on VC.

After the game ended our KJ who apparently is a Rioter hiding in plain-sight added me and said ""great game, i'm sending you a riot gun buddy for being a great teammate"". My friend also got a riot buddy.

  
**TL;DR.:** *Just try to be nice. It won't kill you.*

1grw20m,valorant,My parents freaked out when they saw me playing Valorant,"So, I was casually playing Valorant when my parents came up behind me and saw me holding a knife in-game. My dad immediately shouted, called my mom over, and started saying stuff like, *""He's playing a violent game with stabbing—chuck chuck chuck—and killing!""* He told me to turn it off and started lecturing me about how I'll end up like those ""addicted kids"" on YouTube.

I get that they're concerned, but it's just a game! Valorant isn’t even about violence—it’s a strategy shooter. How do I make them understand that I’m not going to turn into some crazy knife-wielding gamer just because I play a competitive game online? Anyone else had to deal with this kind of reaction?

I’m not sure how bullet spread with the Bucky works but maybe they somehow travel in different velocities and one piece of the spread hits the shield, then the rest of the bullets catch up and kill him?

1eqscum,valorant,Stop saving on round 2 if your team won pistol round.,"Whenever your team wins the first round, you should never save but get the best guns you all can afford. The team that lost pistol round will be in an economic disadvantage and will likely save. By buying stronger guns, your team will be way more powerful than the enemy team, giving you an almost guaranteed win on the second round.

The reason I am making this post is because in many matches, I keep having teammates still using pistols on round 2 after we have won pistol round. This means we don't get the advantage we should have; we are giving the enemies a fair round for no good reason. If the enemies happens to force, it will be even worse for your team. Additionally, if your team loses the second round after winning the first, your team will be the one having to save due to how credits work.

So, please do not save on round 2 after winning the pistol round unless you are specifically saving up for an operator. Buy better guns such as spectres, bulldogs, vandals or phantoms so you can effortlessly defeat enemies still using classics and ghosts. Sniper rifles will work great too.",1608,262,1723504215,Neutral,0.547,neutral,0.878

No. The thing that bothers me the most is its description. ""Equip a seismic charge. Fire to send a cascading quake through all terrain in a large CONE. The quake dazes and knocks up anyone caught in it.""

I know it used to be like that. I've been playing since Ep 1, Act 1. But come on, it's been ages since it hasn't been a cone. It's a rectangle now. And I've given Riot the benefit of the doubt that they'll somehow notice this mistake.

1f1nxin,valorant,one of my d&d characters as a valorant agent (by me),"this is apollyon, aka valorant protocol codename Angel, one of my d&d characters reimagined as an agent! in the campaign he was originally a rogue assassin who was then reclassed as college of whispers bard with a couple levels in paladin. lots of fun homebrew stuff in this campaign, which i tried to adapt into val abilities that i think could fit well with the other agents :)

all the ability descriptions are on the image but heres little explanations for them (id love to hear what ppl think about them haha)

[C] Gravitational Shift - based on a homebrew ability he had that allowed him to use an action to alter gravity for himself (or go intangible) for a few turns. meant to work as sort of an in between Omen and Yoru teleports/Neon slide

[E] Lasso - he was a bit cowboy-esque in that his pegasus Nimbus was a huge part of his combat strategy, and he often used a lasso on enemies and items. The idea is multifunction util to stun enemies or retrieve objects (like dropped spike or guns). maybe havjng both functions is a little OP here im not sure? it could be balanced out by having a shorter duration on concuss effects or something

[C] Radiant Recall - based on his homebrew rapiers that had a similar recall ability. Maybe ideal for post plant lineups and stuff? 

[X] Silent Step - based on the fact his like biggest strength was his stealth. i think by the end of the campaign he had something like a +17 to stealth checks? was known as the shadow assassin cause of it. similar i guess to Astra ult but as a small radius that moves with you for the duration.",1468,103,1724678101,Positive,0.922,neutral,0.555

1g63hg4,valorant,You don't NEED to get a pick to enter the site. Please just go in,"After coming back from Europe (Diamond) to NA (Gold) I've noticed that a lot of players have a fundamental misunderstanding of how to execute a site. A lot of people seem to think that their job is to stand in main and wait for their duelists to get a pick before entering site.

This is completely wrong and will keep you from ranking up until you learn not to do this. Your duelists' job is to enter the site to pressure the enemy team.

If you are just standing in main waiting for your duelists to do everything so the site is completely free for you, the enemy team will not be pressured at all and will just kill your duelist 50% of the time.

When your duelists are entering the site, use your support util (sova dart, omen flash, cypher cam, etc.) to help them take space on site, then follow them. If they die, be there to trade then. It is perfectly fine to execute a site without getting a pick first.

If you are just standing in main waiting for your duelists to get a kill, then calling a rotate any time they don't, you are not going to rank up. You will give the enemy as much time as they need to either stack the site you're on, or flank you so you can't rotate.

This post is aimed at non-duelist players, but if you're an entry duelist, please for the love of god enter the site in the first place rather than waiting for an enemy to offer you a free duel in main.",1448,178,1729204804,Negative,0.851,neutral,0.551

Sometimes when I'm playing I get flashbacks of pubstomping in CS 1.6 and it makes me think about all the people I used to play with 20 years ago, and what they are doing now.

Sometimes when I play DM I sweat so much it gets into the keyboard and shorts the switches, so I play with a box of spare Gateron switches next to me and I'm ready to hotswap like a Formula1 tire team during the game.

I am lucky to have a loving girlfriend/partner who doesn't mind me playing and screaming at 16yo kids in the game who keep repeeking even when we have a 5v3 advantage.

At dinner parties I have to suppress the urge to tell my friends about that 1v3 clutch I won and my average HS% for the day.

Do you think I can go pro?

1h8i3cc,valorant,Ping rework is prolly the worst thing they ever dropped,"I dont like complaining about patches before they come out normally but the ping rework is so garbage even on paper that I feel like its justified.

Ping rework doesn't even solve the issue they're proposing it does. It's supposed to fix spraying the spike through smoke. But you can still spray the spike through the smoke?? You just need to have some basic map knowledge and it's easy?? And even if you can't be exact, you can still just align your character indicator on the map with the spike?

This issue is 100% map design but they've backed themselves into a corner on fixing that because they'd have to majorly rework every single map to fix it. The only site that doesn't have this issue that comes to mind is Ascent B since you cant see spike from main. Which definitely sucks, and it sucks that they really can't fix it without huge effort, but the ping rework kinda points to a dangerous trend of making the game worse in other ways in vain attempts to fix the issue.

And it is gonna make the game a lot worse. If you ever been dead before and you pinged a guy and your ping saved the round, that'll never happen again. Because in no situation ever will someone in a 1v1 clutch look away from their crosshair to see a ping on the map. This also most likely means that these pings won't be audio-directional, which is huge because it lets you register pings way faster. It'll probably also lead to the ranked queue experience just being a lot worse because random queue teammates are going to ignore map pings 9/10 times. Have fun ipad controllers.

1csb71l,valorant,Unpopular opinion: YouTube content for this game is boring af and it’s mostly riots fault.,"The most prominent content is showcasing new skins, ranked highlights, and smurfing which gets boring fast to watch.

I genuinely feel bad for the creators trying to do fun, creative content like custom games. They limit you so much with the options in game. How is there still NO REPLAY SYSTEM, the quality of videos would increase substantially with it.

1ffp20j,valorant,Why can’t Viper just pick up her orb? Is she stupid? ,"Like just pick it up?? It’s just right there!! Simple action that needs minimal motor skills. It’s less complicated than picking up an ult orb that every character can do.

What are the preventions? Does the smoke orb root itself to the ground? No, there are no legs on the orb. It even bounces once in some cases. Is the orb indiscriminately harmful object? No. The orb itself is not a super-duper complicated tech that needs to be handled with extraordinary caution. Viper's allies can walk through her toxicity and vibe in it or something. No way Viper is scared of her orb in that tight protective suit!

Unlike KJ nanoswarm that is advanced nanotech and harmful without caution even to her allies, thus it is justified that it cannot be picked up! Cypher Vyse Deadlock can do full telekinesis on their gears, and Vyse can just yoink it through the walls. KJ can even lowkey do Dr. Strange summoning circle on her turret and bot.

Viper though, she just needs to ~~bend over~~ and grab it, as long as it is not operating, yet she can't! Aura -100

We have Chamber that has credit cards that transform into cool gears and can locate his anchor and trips at will, with full charisma in his “look good” poses. His entire personality is “idc what you do, just be gud and look gud doin it”. He definitely keeps his aura that most of us dig. And ofc! He can just pick it up with telekinesis from across the map!

But for Ms. Sabine, a co-founder of Valorant protocol whose character is about pure hate, seeking revenge and “choking” enemies with the biggest villain vibe, cannot handle a small orb that is her own product. 

""I WiLL tAkE eVeRyThinG fRoM THEM"" nah big sis, you can't even take your own orb!

She needs to spend 10x time lining up her smoke orb compared to other throwables, and she is done over the orb as soon as it leaves her hand. Seriously. What is wrong with Viper?",1126,82,1726212969,Neutral,0.459,anger,0.35
1f0li1a,valorant,Why does Valorant not have a rr compensation system when a cheater is banned after a game ends? ,"So yesterday I had a game where I encountered the most blatant cheater I've seen in all of my four years playing this game, they had player esp and aimbot as they would constantly be able to kill me and my teammates behind walls with near flawless accuracy and info, get several aces throughout the game even with fighting 3v1's and be able to immediately start running towards our direction without any info or knowledge of our presence. And the thing is riot knows they were hacking when they issued this message to me after me and my team lost. My question is why is there no compensation in ranked for encountering players like this and how is just banning a cheater a good enough consequence when the cheater was using an alt account as they were unranked and they could just get another account and do the same thing?

1eacwhh,valorant,Drop a tip from your main that most people might not know,"Mines gonna be for sage and her wall. Most of the time the enemy will shoot the wall to low HP and then reload so they have a mostly full mag before the wall opens. If you let them damage the wall and they start reloading. Break the wall yourself immediately before and it’s a free kill 9/10 times. A lot depends on position of the wall but it’s comical how often this works for me. I don’t even main sage anymore and I still do this with both friendly and enemy sage walls. I’ll play close to the sage wall (if nobody else is) and when I hear them start the reload I immediately break it and swing them while they’re reloading tucked behind another segment of her wall. 

Example of this being applied. I was a Jett on haven. We were defending the planted spike on C and sage walled off garage. Enemy phoenix used his specter to damage the wall (they were on eco) and the second I hear the reload audio, break that wall yourself and enjoy the least stressful gunfight you’ll ever have in the game.

So Riot and Supercakes just outright confirmed that Valorant will be making the switch to UE5.

Thing is, I think we've already been shown a sneak peek of some animations.

In the Incursions // Console Cinematic, there is a quick montage at the end that cycles through a bunch of agents.

Every shot looks like a current agent select animation remade.

See the side-by-side for yourself. Note that they ARE different (for the better).

The poses are much more dynamic, the sets are polished, and the post-processing is gorgeous.

1d78o7b,valorant,"I tried Val for less than two days, and I'm horrified by this community...","I played Val back in the beta, but after playing CS for so many years, it just didn't click for me. Fast forward to the present day where I no longer play CS and haven't for a couple years, I thought I'd give Val another try. I'm a little older, late 20s, so solo queuing was something I was not looking forward to.

I was truly horrified by this community. I received multiple death threats, throwing in unrated, shit talking for being new to the game. I don't even use my mic, nor even text chat unless someone is directly talking to me or to quickly say if someone is lit, but I can't believe how toxic people were to me. I mostly only played Swfitplay, a couple unrated, and a two ranked games. Never again will I play ranked. I don't want to be stuck with such miserable people. 

Example:

First round, we pushed site and I had the spike. We technically had site, but I knew where the last two enemies were. They were both in the site's main corridor about to rush the site. While this is going on, we have two friendlies on the other site.... so with my years of CS knowledge, I knew the right thing was to take bomb over to the other site to confuse the enemy. It resulted in me getting 4 kills and us winning with the bomb plant. I thought we as a team did an awesome job, and I was proud of my quick thinking with the rotation.

The dude on the site where I rotated off of started calling me a baiter. Saying how much I suck and that I should have planted on that site. And that I used them as bait... I'm brand new to this game, I saw an opportunity to benefit the team and I took it. They then proceeded to bad mouth me the entire game, ending it with a death threat. I never once said anything back other than questioning what was going on and why I was being berated. I even said we were teammates, lets just be cool together. 

This is just one example of many horrific encounters I found in just the past two days. I'm done with Valorant... back to singleplayer games for me. I don't have the mental energy for people to take out their life problems on a stranger, in a damn video game. I don't need to be called all sorts of horrific things while being told to end myself.  I deal with sever depression enough in my real life, I certainly don't need it in a video game.

EDIT: The fact that the response to this is so mixed, proves my point. And quite frankly, is absolutely wild to me. Be better to each other, folks, that's my only point here.",1072,518,1717432124,Negative,0.959,fear,0.898

1cyxhw2,valorant,Dear Duelist Mains...,"If you don't want default smokes while defending, I'd like to remind you that this game is so generous to provide us with not one, but two ways to relay this information. So please, COMMUNICATE before, I repeat... BEFORE the round begins. I'm really sorry I don't have psychic powers to know whether your restless fingers will make you stay on site or rush immediately as the walls vanish.

Due to a difference in playstyle, we might not agree on the best way to defend a site. Through constant maining of smokes, we have a habit of smoking as close to the site as possible. Specially in solo qeues, where you guys like to stay quiet in chat until you tilt, we prefer smoking default as the safest option.

But we do not claim that to be the best way to defend. In fact, we ourselves sometimes like to change things up a bit. So instead of finding ways to insult my mom after I put my smokes, tell me how you want them before I deploy them. Have some respect for those who are watching your back, always ready to trade if you fuck up. Always their to support you with blinds and mollies.

Yours sincerely,

I know there's another one that cuts through the initial choke but I don't really use it much.

I recently was told this wall is ""dogshit"" and to ""stop that"" when 3 teammates couldn't hold site. I asked them what wall they wanted instead and they got angrier and had no answer so I just started using my wall on B instead. I muted them because they were honestly sexist freaks (doesn't really bother me anymore but they weren't giving any useful comms) and our Breach started using his util on me trying to throw and got comms banned for trying to say something in text chat. I still MVP'd and won the match for us in a 1v4, but this all stemmed from doing this wall and I don't understand because everyone does this wall??? What am I missing?

Edit: Thank you everyone for the help. I understand the wall is not a problem and I will try more to coordinate with my teammates on their intentions for the round so I can improve my timings, as it seems that's the main thing everyone said may be the issue. Looking forward to cooking everyone on this map even more.

Edit 2: I lost a match and now my 100% win rate is gone :( it's 83% now. BUT the ones I HAVE won have been crazy for me, recently I got 42RR for one!

1h609sw,valorant,I understand why you guys are hardstuck in lower elo,"I've been playing on a friends account in Gold as an Ascendant player, and honestly my eyes have been opened.

Those posts about people complaining to be hardstuck or better than the rank they deserve, well I've quite literally experienced that objectively and it doesn't sound crazy at all to me anymore. Dropping 30 kills and getting match MVP 9/10 of the games, but yet I'm losing around half of them.

4/5 of the players on my team **are not me.** This means that:

**80%** of the shots fired, decisions made, utility executed, and every last footstep or key pressed is **not me.**  
**20%** of the shots fired, decisions made, utility executed, and every last footstep or key pressed **is me.**

The overwhelming majority of games you win are because **your team was better than the enemy team**, not because you personally were better. This is inversely true when recalling games I've went 5-17 and won anyway.

Every time I've made an alt account, it got placed in low diamond or high plat. I've not played in a silver-gold elo lobby in several years, and while assuming this would be easier, it has so far turned out to be significantly more difficult.

The majority of these lobbies feel exactly the same, because almost no one is actually the rank they're playing in, and I'm not able to perform consistently against a wildly varied combination of immortals on alt accounts for both sides. It's very clear by their movement and mechanics (and default banner) the majority of these players are not actually gold, but rather doing the same thing I'm doing.

Were I to actually be a Gold player, this would be nearly impossible to climb out of, and I'm not sure it would be something anyone sane could dedicate their time to.

Each match genuinely feels like a coin toss because I'm either going to drop 30 and lose, or play against what feels like a normal game at ascendant because it technically is for half the players in the lobby.

This just ends up being hard carry vs hard carry, and sometimes their hard carry is better. It's not what the game felt like during the first couple years at all, or at least it wasn't nearly as frequently.

Anyway just wanted to share this with people who felt hard stuck even while performing better than the average player in their rank. They're not crazy despite what people say on here all the time.

Yes it's possible they're delusional because this happens in every game where someone overestimates their ability, but there's genuinely a chance you're on a hamster wheel working against variables out of your control.

Also as an interesting side note, I've **never** and I do mean literally never seen the red screen of cheater detected while playing Valorant since beta going on 4 years now on my main account or alt accounts I've made. 

That being said, on his account just within the 50 games I've played, 2 games were literally terminated by someone **cheating in Gold.** ",906,500,1733265171,Negative,0.65,neutral,0.308

1g11zg5,valorant,We need to talk about the Troublemaker Bundle...,",Halloween is around the corner and riot has released the troublemaker bundle celebrating it.

The Bundle includes one playercard, one gunbuddy, one spray and one title for 1145VP.

I am having some trouble justifying this bundle for a few reasons, lets talk about it.

**--The Pricing--**

In my opinion, we are having another Duos Day situation. This bundle is if looked at in a vacuum allready really pricy, but the price gets worse if you start comparing it.

Duos Day had the same concept: A bundle that only be purchased as a bundle, with no possibility of buying any item seperately.

Duos Day included: One Gunbuddy, Three Playercards, 3 Titles and 2 Sprays and cost 1650VP. Duos Day was allready heavily overpriced for being a bundle without gun skins, but lets compare the two pricing wise.

Duos Day has 9 items for 1650VP meaning each item cost 183VP - 1650/9. I know that a spray wont cost as much as a gun buddy, but since you could not buy them individually i think i can allow this calculation. Troublemaker has 4 Items for 1145VP meaning each item costs 286VP, 100VP more than Duos Day meaning on average its even pricier than Duos Day was.

Another Feature that Valorant has also costs less than the Troublemaker Bundle: The Battlepass.  
A bundle that includes 4 Items and no high quality gun skins should never be more expensive than a Battlepass.

**--The Advertising--**  
All bundles come with a picture that displays it in the item store. .  
Remember that the bundle only includes **one gunbuddy**, **one playercard** and **one spray**.  
The picture is missleading the bundle into making it more than it is. Duos Day had the same issue, but only with the gunbuddy. A gif where the buddy and card change and the spray is animated would have done the job.

Secondly, if you click on to the bundle you will see that each item has an individual discount.

Gunbuddy, spray, playercard: -35% in Bundle  
Title: -40% in Bundle

This Discount is only a way to try and justify the price as there is no way to buy these items seperately.  
This also makes the average cost of 286VP per item higher since you need to add 35% and 40% on top of every item respectively.  
Duos Day, again, had the same issue with a ""Bundle Discount"" that is only cosmetic since you can not buy any items seperatly.

**--Event Passes and Free Rewards--**  
In the past we had something that is called an ""Event Pass"".  
Event Passes are small battlepasses, usually consisting of 7 tiers that offer free rewards for just playing the game and gaining xp.  
The last Event Pass we had was for Valorant Champions Seoul.  
Usually Event passes celebrate something, we had Esports related ones, there was a birthday one, one for celebraing the launch of Arcane and ones to celebrate Lunar New Year.  
There is no reason for this to be a bundle if Event Passes exist.  
Event Passes offer more rewards for only playing, so this again makes the price look insanely high.

We also had the pride collection in the past to celebrate pride month.  
The pride collection this year was a code reward, but in 2023 it was a featured, free bundle in the store that included:

* One Gunbuddy
* 3 Titles
* 8 Playercards 

  
There would be no issue making the troublemaker bundle free, whether it would be event pass or a free bundle if we had rewards with the same amount of items or more for free in the past.  
I will pass on this. I really like the items and would love to have them in my collection, but i cant justify buying it.If you like it, then there is nothign wrong with buying it of course, this is solely my opinion and i am here to spark some discussion and conversation regarding valorants cosmetics.

Thank you for reading and Happy Halloween!!

Being able to use a really strong piece of util 3-4 times in a round always ends up being really strong and difficult/annoying to play against. And neon has become the same way. She can slide and full accuracy kill you 3-4 times in a normal round and 3-5 times in a round where she has her ult.

I'm a girl and I have been playing roughly for a year now and as of recent I've found unbearable to speak these last few months. I know how toxic in general the gaming community can be towards women. But these last few months it's just been worse. 

I've been called a plethora of names, sexually harassed, had teammates throw, and I've been blamed for losing games for simply speaking. I can't make callouts without being harassed or bullied and while I've just defaulted to turning my mic off typing in chat sucks. I know most people will say just mute them or ignore it but it's so disheartening that I can't play or make callouts without being harassed. 

It's not every game but it's a good majority of them. I'm not sure how to deal with it anymore. I've taken a break but I really do like playing the game, but the amount of toxicity really sucks. 


EDIT: Thank you for all the kind comments and the advice! 

To answer a few questions im 24, i play on PC and I normally solo q. I usually play in the central NA sever. I typically play comp because I heard that people tend to take the game more serious. I am in in lower elo (im b3 my peak has been s3) so thats like a 50/50 chance sometimes. its tough haha 😅 I usually queue alone just because many of my friends don't like val 

I'm disheartened to see how many people have also had a similar experience. however its definitely not surprising :( 

i understand the gaming community can be toxic however it really does suck that the only option it seems is to mute or not speak. I love talking but not when i'm being berated for it. 

I'm definitely looking into joining a sever and queuing up with some people that reached out :) but for now I definitely need a break. 

thank you all again :3

He was granted a wish from Make A Wish and I’ve been talking with him to try to help him come up with a wish.  He’s been playing Minecraft more than half of his life and it’s his favorite thing in the world.  His wish is to see the headquarters where his favorite game is made.  First he asked to go to Mojang in Sweden but from what I read online, it’s just a bunch of offices and maybe not as magical as he thinks.  I don’t know much about the US Mojang headquarters in Redmond, WA but maybe that would be a better destination for his wish?  

Maybe there is a better idea for a Minecraft related wish?  Maybe attend the movie premiere for the Minecraft movie? Or is there some other Minecraft destination that should be on our radar?  

I just want his wish to be truly magical and I’m worried that visiting an office building might not be the right ask.  What ideas do you have? ",15090,221,1728310056,Positive,0.851,neutral,0.474

1fvgwlq,minecraft,The Pale Garden should have been a cave biome ,"It’s probably far too late for this feedback to be useful but I wanna give it anyways

The Pale Garden would have been perfect as a cave biome. To me the overworld is split into two halves, the semi realistic surface and the hostile and mysterious

In the past Mojang would use the caves as a perfect area for more fantastical and experimental features, such as the deep dark and Trial Chambers

Minecraft’s underground has always been this mysterious place where any fantasy feature would fit right in, I believe the Pale Garden would’ve been a perfect addition to the caves as a rare biome like the ancient city

The Pale Garden feels genuinely out of place on the service and messes with the above grounds vibe imo. Something about the pale garden being a surface biome just feels way off, and not in a creepy way, it’s just wrong imo

Being underground would elevate a feeling of isolation and give the biome a real alien vibe, in some situations you could really be trapped in the biome 

While unlikely to happen this change is far from impossible, all the existing pale garden content could just be moved underground

I see Mojang’s vision for the biome, the creaking is an amazing idea, but personally I just really think it’d be even better as a cave monster

The material used in the build is mostly irrelevant. It can be stone, dirt, netherrite, anything... as long as it's easy to get a hold of, and appropriate to build with! 

For those out there who have countless double chests filled with building blocks - how did you acquire them? With a farm of some kind? With tnt quarry machines? With an old-fashioned pickaxe + haste beacon? I'd be interested to know :)

1ejvz2m,minecraft,What old mob do you think should have its model improved next? ,"The reason i chose the rabbit for this post is bc it's the closest to the old bat, both had a bland and out of date looking model compared to newer more detailed mobs. Not only that but rabbits have way more potential as a new pet mob rather than only a huntable one. I don't see people talking about rabbits at all, they're so forgotten, specially in the farming community, its drops aren't that useful, its meat is more as a last minute resource rather than a good food source and don't get me started on rabbit stew; Rabbit foot effect isn't good and could easily be replaced by something like brewing slimeballs + rabbit hide wasn't useful until bundles came in. Don't get me wrong and ik this is a polemic topic but i think rabbits shouldn't have drops or at least remove rabbit meat, rabbit stew and rabbit foot. Rabbits are cute and CAN be friendly creatures, ik bc i have 2 at home rn and i would love to be able to tame them or make so they don't run from you after giving them some carrots or something, maybe they would even help you at farm fields when feeded a golden carrot idk this is Minecraft after all.

The house on the water was by my older brother while I made everything else, since he would always fall asleep.

This was when he had a substance problem, so I always tried playing stuff like bo2 zombies or Minecraft to try and help him. He later got very worse, and was homeless for a while and still is, but now is apparently clean. I don’t really want to talk with him anymore though. 

Here are some screenshots of our world, we have lots of worlds but this was our final main one. We had an Adventure Time texture pack world after this one since he liked that show, but that world got nowhere since that was when he was very bad. I’m glad we had this world at least and we slayed the Ender Dragon. I wish I was able to slay the Ender Dragon without host privileges though so I could finally get the achievement.  

I just wanted to post our world and kinda talk about it since nobody else really knows about this world. Feel free to ask stuff about the world and what we did. Please don’t ask questions about my brother, I will not respond to those. ",8304,76,1731519550,Neutral,0.47,disgust,0.839

What are everyone's thoughts on the new blocks?

Personally, I love the idea of collecting resin, especially since it's a new interesting reason to harvest trees in the pale forest. But, I personally don't like the texture of the block. I can absolutely see them in some builds, mainly candy style, but they look very out of place compared to the surrounding textures. I don't think I would have even thought of adding resin as a block.

1d6ltvj,minecraft,I got banned from my own realm for swearing. This is so ridiculous.,"RANT
This is so fucked and I'm extremely pissed off. My friends and I started a realm less than a month ago and have been playing it non stop since then having tons of fun. I was playing today and left the world for a minute to go to the bathroom and when I returned I was hit with an error message when I tried to join the world. So I restarted my game and when it launched a notice popped up saying that I've been suspended for *seven days.* 
I haven't been on any public servers whatsoever recently, it's not like anybody has reported me. The reason I've been suspended is for swearing in our realm in the text chat. Really? Why are they monitoring our chats unprovoked in our own private realm that we pay for? We say crazy things, but that is NONE of their business and what we say is NOT to be taken seriously. Absolutely nobody has offended or harassed one another in the realm and there is absolutely no valid reason for me to have been suspended, especially not for an entire week. 

EDIT: Support just reinstated my account so I can play again now. 

I get that I technically broke a rule, but it's an outlandish rule and all of you that are telling me that I got a well-deserved punishment are acting so ridiculous and look pretty dumb when you say that. Have a good day

Another edit: For everyone saying to just host my own server, believe me,I typically would but some of my friends on this server don't have PC's which is why we're just using a realm. I know there are lots of different kinds of servers we could switch to to accommodate, but my friend who is hosting on Xbox probably doesn't wanna go through the trouble of doing at that right now, even though I know it wouldn't be that hard lol",6770,258,1717358158,Negative,0.949,anger,0.914

I thought the download options and Microsoft account options looked complicated - so I gave her a shortcut to ""Minecraft Classic"". I tried it out and, hey this is pretty neat. Once we figured out how to print the help menu and type **b** to switch modes.

She took a look at it, however, and told me this game didn't have any inventory or animals moving around. And she wants the ""regular"" Minecraft. Now which one would that be?

There appears to be:

* Minecraft Classic (a web application)
* Minecraft Live (appears to be a web application)
* Minecraft Bedrock
* Minecraft Java
* Minecraft Launcher
* Minecraft Dungeons
* Minecraft Legends
* Minecraft Education

Having looked around, the one I **really** want to get her is Minecraft Education... but that seems like a non-started with the Microsoft account. That's a shame because she loves programming with Scratch.

Meanwhile, things I don't want to do:

* A monthly subscription
* Online chats with strangers
* A game with features that have to be unlocked by paying money

1hdbd7k,minecraft,"Since we have the turtle helmet, I thought it would be cool to have more animal armor, so how about bunny boots!","They have the same defense as leather boots, but increase your sprinting speed when you wear them

Since they require rabbits feet, it would be (relatively) rare, and you'd have to choose between the more defensive armor or speed",6339,158,1734093754,Positive,0.67,neutral,0.94
