Distilling some commonly-answered questions in this comment:

\-""Is that actual slow-motion?"" Yes, I'm using a slow-motion soft-mod for this clip. The moment where I dunk Bazel is actually the ""real-time"" part of the clip. Everything else is sped up to match normal gameplay speeds.

\-""Over 1000 damage on a Bazelgeuse head without heroics?"" Those damage numbers I achieved are possible in-game. The setup for it is ridiculous though. You need max spiribirds with the demon petalace, all attack boosting items, peak performance lvl 3, white sharpness, and the elemental boost melody/infernal melody from HH.

\-""How long did this take?"" 4 hours of failure. Bazel tends to do his ultimate when not heated up...so I didn't have a lot of chances to practice the dunk timing with his better hit zone available.

\-""Bonk?"" Bonk.",2021-07-09T11:31:56,LABEL_1,0.5057899951934814

Seriously I'm a melee enjoyer and the only Hunting game that gave me the pleasure of punching stuff in the face was Toukiden (fun as hell too in it,the more you punch the faster your fists catch fire)

Also those designs are crazy good goddamn!",2024-10-06T02:16:47,LABEL_2,0.7727583646774292

comment,monsterhunter,2024,lqhx4jm,1fwwl4h,"First of all, **awesome** work.

It is unique enough not to overlap into other weapon themes, it promotes the use of the lesser widespread Blunt type of damage and most importantly it has a focus on its gameplay, you want to combo your blows in unique combinations to properly balance your Phial resource.

I would like to share some insights regarding how I see the special moves coming in actual play:

* The **BIG BOOM**, I get it, I am a Gunlance user at heart, and nothing fills it with more joy than a huge Wyvern Fire to the face of the nearest monster. However 6 seconds is a rather long time to be standing still for a single move on an action packed fight. Fortunatelly, it seems this number came from the amount of Phials used on the attack (2 seconds for every pair x3 = 6 sec). You may want to reduce the number to something like 1,5 sec per pair of Phials. That way you still have a huge pay off in about 4,5 seconds, which would be at least closer the the Wyvern Fire example above.
* All of the moves that involve using the R button have a rather unique identity, except for the Left and Right Haymakers. Since each costs a single Phial of their respective type, maybe you could add something to differentiate them instead of being the same move done with a different hand. As a few examples, you could consider moving the offset attack to the Red (Circle) haymaker to have a defensive move and put a Shoryuken on the Green (Triangle) Haymaker, to give you more tools to work with against flying enemies instead of relying on the Leap which uses both types of Phials.
* Talking about the Leap, you could also go one step beyond and make it able to be charged for increased distance or increased damage Skullcrusher moves.

In any case, I find your weapon really compelling and would 100% test it if I had the chance.  
Best of luck, and happy hunting.",2024-10-06T02:47:51,LABEL_2,0.5405735373497009
