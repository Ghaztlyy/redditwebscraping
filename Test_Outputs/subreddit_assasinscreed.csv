comment,assasinscreed,2024,m2jyfis,1hgix3n,"Replaying it as we speak!
Love to switch between the twins: Evie when I want to go all stealth and Jacob when I want chaos haha, and the combat is so fun to me.",2024-12-18T05:00:32,LABEL_2,0.9746381044387817
comment,assasinscreed,2024,m2jrt3x,1hgix3n,"It's pretty much that AC game to me where I'm just like ""Oh yeah, that one exists"". Pretty much the AC of all time.

I like just running around however, and I also really like the Rope Launcher since you can weave it smoothly in you freeruns and get back up quickly if you failed a jump (well, if this game had a jump button anyway).",2024-12-18T04:25:25,LABEL_2,0.7587270736694336

comment,assasinscreed,2024,m2kjw7v,1hgix3n,"I don‚Äôt hate it but it was definitely the first step down.
- Downfall of parkour in the series.
- Enemies health was buffed a lot leading to drawn out combat.
- Jacob didn‚Äôt feel like an assassin at all.
- Lastly the story is pretty forgettable.",2024-12-18T06:57:20,LABEL_0,0.9053027629852295
comment,assasinscreed,2024,m2k25wo,1hgix3n,"Story was blah, the romance with Evie was the most forced Ive ever seen, but gameplay was good. Interesting way to add in the character switching.",2024-12-18T05:20:28,LABEL_2,0.4379483759403229

comment,assasinscreed,2024,m2lejfw,1hgix3n,"I just don't see what it does better than any other entry. Story is meh, parkour is gutted, combat is hard to take seriously with how slapstick it is, it looks worse than Unity that came out earlier. Top it off with being generally buggy and having a poor pc port, there's really nothing that elevates it above any other entry in the series. It's middling at best IMO. Perfectly okay to like it, it's subjective after all.",2024-12-18T10:03:46,LABEL_0,0.815617024898529
