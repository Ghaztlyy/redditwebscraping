comment,dota2,2021,h5vk9w2,oo16vu,"I don't have to deal with it personally, but I've seen/heard it happen. It is so depressing to watch.

I played a game where our pos 5 was crushing on support, the whole team was happy with the pulls, lane harass, unselfishly securing first blood for the carry and were giving them props. Then pos 5 says ""thanks guys. we got this game"" in a girls voice. There was a brief moment of silence while 60% of the brain cells on our team died. The whole dynamic suddenly shifts... ""are you a girl?!"" ""omg, that so hot"" ""I like gurl"" etc.

I tell them to shut up and play the game but it's too late. Our team turns toxic as everyone plays differently and the girl no longer seems into it (can't blame her at all). our carry players are either too distracted or start dying ""noble deaths"" to save our pos 5 girl. We had a big advantage out of the lane and lost what seemed like instantly. I tried to apologize for them, but I'm pretty sure she had muted our whole team by that point. 

It turns out that both genders can click buttons. so why can't we treat all players like people. Don't die a noble death for your pos 5 - thats dumb, they are there to die a noble death for you. If there is a girl in your lobby, treat her like everyone else. say things like ""pull creeps you piece of shit"" or ""harass the carry you piece of shit"" or ""I literally hate you you piece of shit"" like you say to everyone else.",2021-07-20T22:08:48,LABEL_0,0.8860536813735962

Following encounters with a powerful, ancient eldwurm as well as the noble Princess Mirana on a secret mission of her own, Davion becomes embroiled in events much larger than he could have ever imagined.

The series will receive 8 episodes. Studio MIR (The Legend of Korra, Voltron: Legendary Defender) is in charge of the animation production.

comment,dota2,2021,gnpina2,llh8q5,"> *After years on the trail of a legendary Eldwurm, the skilled dragon-slayer found himself facing a disappointing foe: the dreaded Slyrak had grown ancient and frail, its wings tattered, its few remaining scales stricken with scale-rot, its fangs ground to nubs, and its fire-gouts no more threatening than a pack of wet matchsticks. Seeing no honor to be gained in dragon-murder, the young knight prepared to turn away and leave his old foe to die in peace. But a voice crept into his thoughts, and Slyrak gave a whispered plea that the knight might honor him with death in combat. The knight agreed, and found himself rewarded beyond expectation for his act of mercy: As he sank his blade in Slyrak's breast, the dragon sank a claw into his throat. As their blood mingled, Slyrak sent his power out along the Blood Route, offering all its strength and centuries of wisdom to the knight. The dragon's death sealed their bond, and Dragon Knight was born. The ancient power slumbers in the knight, waking when he calls it; or perhaps it is the Dragon that calls the Knight...*",2021-02-17T08:18:30,LABEL_1,0.6475841999053955

Come over to Lemmy, it's a reddit alternative that is run by the community itself, spread across multiple servers.

You make your account on one server (called an instance) and from there you can access everything on all other servers as well. [Find one you like here](https://lemmyverse.net/), maybe not the largest ones to spread the load around, but it doesn't really matter.

You can then look for communities to subscribe to on https://lemmyverse.net/communities, this website shows you all communities across all instances.

If you're looking for some (mobile?) apps, [this topic](https://lemm.ee/post/363116) has a great list.

One personal tip: For your convenience, I would advise you to use [this userscript I made](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/469273-lemmy-universal-link-switcher) which automatically changes all links everywhere on the internet to the server that you chose.

Later, a fan of his shows up and started a convo with him. He was clearly ~~nervous~~ alpha talking to her and at the end she was trying to get his number but he just awkwardly laughed. When she left, EE looked at us and we just told him ""how tf did you not see what she was trying to do"". He then said, ""Should I get her number?"" at which point we just pointed to the direction she went and he sprinted to find her (he runs like Niko Bellic). I'd say 5 min later he came back saying he lost her and then the rest of our friends came back and we all took a group photo with EE at the center.

post,dota2,2020,ganyoe,,"the amount of sexual harassment I receive as a female dotA player is abhorrent Over 2,500 hours on dota. Played 3 pub games today and in every one after using my mic/revealing myself as a female there was a creep. In my last game I had a guy harassing me for tit pics (and then when I refused he started demanding how much I weigh, because ""with my voice I had to be over 200lbs or a man with hairy tits."") lovely, right? That is one voice line from 3 games of hearing this shit. I'm fucking over it. the kicker? not a single teammate spoke up or told the douchenozzles to knock it off. this is a community issue. sexual harassment should NOT be tolerated and there needs to be more severe punishment for this vs feeding or afking. 

I am losing my love for this game and the community.

post,dota2,2021,m0suug,,"I am retiring from Dota 2 Wiki. Here's what that means for the community. I'm Lemon, head admin of [Dota 2 Wiki](http://dota2.gamepedia.com/Dota_2_Wiki). For the last 9 years, I've been keeping the wiki updated (with much help from /u/Bu3nyy and others). But I haven't played Dota for many years now, and simply don't have time to keep doing this. So I'm retiring.

Luckily, over the last few years Buny has taken over game mechanics updates, while I still update the hats, events, lore, TI, and generally anything that's not gameplay mechanics. So after I leave, **the cosmetics database will stop being updated**. Pages for events like [Aghanim's Labyrinth](https://dota2.gamepedia.com/Aghanim%27s_Labyrinth) will no longer be made, at least not by me. 

Buny has said he will keep updating game mechanics for the time being, so don't worry if you only care about hero balance changes. But if anyone wants to help with the other stuff, read on:

#The Cosmetics Database

The [cosmetics database](https://dota2.gamepedia.com/Cosmetic_Item) is currently 100% up to date (12,294 articles). I've made a page for every single hat and HUD item in the game, except for a few temporary event items. All hats have previews in the form of videos, gifs, or screenshots. All significant customizations (effects, animations, icons, sounds, styles) have been checked and listed on the wiki.

This has taken well over 1000 hours over the years, even with a Python script. Arcanas and complicated treasures can take 3~4 hours, even with my familiar routine/setup. Each summer's TI cosmetics take up to 100 hours. Because of the time needed, I don't really expect anyone to keep updating the hat database. And tbh, no one else has really shown an interest in doing it since the game came out. 

If you want to try and update it, just look at any similar page and copy the templates, then fill in each parameter. General information on every item is found in items_game.txt (the schema). To find the full customizations list for making tables, check the schema & the file in Dota Workshop Tools (the in-game displays are sometimes incomplete or incorrect). Icons and sounds are extracted from .pak files. Basic knowledge of Mediawiki markup is nice. Exact spelling of everything is required or things will break. Use the source editor, visual edits suck.

Programs I use: 

* ValveResourceViewer to extract game files (schema, icons, etc)
* Dota Workshop Tools to check custom animations lists & capture some effects/models  
* Notepad++ to parse patch notes/mass find & replace
* OBS Studio to record videos
* Adobe After Effects & Premiere to edit/crop videos
* Photoshop for animated gifs/screenies

#Event Pages
Event pages like [The International](https://dota2.gamepedia.com/The_International_10_Battle_Pass), [Diretide](https://dota2.gamepedia.com/Diretide_2020) or [The Underhollow](https://dota2.gamepedia.com/The_Underhollow) are not hard to make, they just require time and good organization of information. I try to use as many tables as possible, new headings whenever necessary, and short sentences in point form so things are understandable at a glance.

If you make a page for a future event, don't write long rambling paragraphs that nobody will read. Extract icons from game files so it doesn't look like a wall of plain text, then arrange as much info in tables as you can.

#The Lore Database

The [lore database](https://dota2.gamepedia.com/Lore) has about 650 articles, and represents maybe 10% of Dota 2's lore. The idea was to make a wiki page for every character, god, place, species, artifact, concept -- every tiny little thing that's mentioned even once in hero biographies, hat flavor text, comics, trailers, event lore, Underlords, Artifact, etc. This was a HUGE fantasy project and I basically gave up after a few hundred hours.

I've gone over most of the older hero bios/voice lines/item flavor texts, but never started on the comics, Underlords cards, let alone the upcoming anime. Adding references after every sentence and writing the same info on multiple related pages turned to be super tedious, so I don't expect people to do it that seriously (but it would be nice).

If you want to help complete it, try to look at the way the existing pages are done, and just copy the page & fill in the blanks. The templates are simple and easy to use. Reference tags are strongly recommended and work just like the ones on Wikipedia. 

#Others
Miscellaneous work on articles like Patches, [Versions](https://dota2.gamepedia.com/Game_Versions), Dota Plus, Shards, [Chat Wheel](https://dota2.gamepedia.com/Chat_Wheel), [Medals](https://dota2.gamepedia.com/Matchmaking/Seasonal_Rankings), [Trophies](https://dota2.gamepedia.com/Trophy), [Emoticons](https://dota2.gamepedia.com/Emoticons), etc. [List here](https://dota2.gamepedia.com/Template:SystemNav). Most of these don't require big frequent updates and should be easy for anyone to do, just change or add a few things to the existing tables.

#Goodbye
It's been a great 9 years with the Dota 2 community, and I've had many tense 90-min matches where I really had to go pee but couldn't let down my team so I just used an old yogurt bucket under my bed while waiting to respawn. There was also much in-game flaming over my unorthodox jungle Sniper strategy (uwu). But that's okay, I forgive you all <3

/u/Bu3nyy is now the head admin in charge of Dota 2 Wiki. I've transferred everything over to him. Please direct all future complaints to the Bunbun.

Thanks everybody. Goodbye.

Edit: Thanks for the appreciation everyone! If anyone wants to donate a few bucks to me, there's a link on the wiki's [Twitter profile](https://twitter.com/dota2wiki). I am really poor and will use it for dental work ;_;

Edit 2: Wow, thanks for all the recognition & gold & donations everybody! It's really gonna help me out. I'm going to bed now, so goodnight and thanks again to all, and I hope the best for the future of the Dota 2 community.",2021-03-09T07:12:37,LABEL_1,0.5376672148704529

post,dota2,2020,hip4ou,,"It is time to expose DOTA2 cheats and for Valve to make an effort. Patches updating. People blinded by the excitement and spending altogether millions and millions of dollars. Occasionally you may find yourself asking sometimes when you lose a game: ""Skywrath is scripting"",""Meepo is scripting"", ""Tinker can't possibly spam all spells and items that fast"". And all you think is that you should report that bastard and ease yourself with your own theory that 1 out of 10 games, there is at least one cheater. No my friend, ***what if I told you that 10 out of 10 games, there is always someone cheating?*** I Am expecting that every time i'm playing right now.

Because cheats are still available as before and you can actually spend just a mere ***2 dollar*** for a **whole weeks** access to cheat your way through in Dota2. What is this cheat i'm talking about? This page is currently only in russian language. With a little help of automatic google translate, I could easily find out where to press the buttons and finally found myself in the buying section.

I Also found out that there is around 70 000 members in that page (Source in swedish according to my own language google translation:  [https://imgur.com/gallery/DQqmaLh](https://imgur.com/gallery/DQqmaLh) ) and they probably all had access to dota scripts. According to [dota.rgp.io](https://dota.rgp.io) , Russian and Europe servers are always dominating with at least 14 000 active players at the same time ***(If you are not playing in EU West or East, you wouldn't know that Russian Server is always first and best option with lowest ping).*** Therefore, have you ever felt like you played with cheaters, that feeling must have been spot on. My guess is that Russian and European servers are very corrupt.

Out of respect to the community, I do **not** want to expose the name of the developers because it also means **you** having access from the moment you are reading this post. So I will try my best to prevent you from exploiting it because it's simply not that worth it. AND if you are possibly working with valve or anything, I will gladly share the source in private. If you, as a dota player, feel the urge to find this cheat, even if i'm trying to avoid that, then I say good luck and I hope it is the answer to all of your hopes of becoming a better dota player but believe me;

**It is not.** You will also get virus warnings and maybe you will also contribute to Valve making an effort to shut this script down.

[https://imgur.com/gallery/brx3Pml](https://imgur.com/gallery/brx3Pml)

[https://imgur.com/gallery/2HwnlLx](https://imgur.com/gallery/2HwnlLx)

And to answer your questions already now: YES I tried this cheat for a month, just to make sure I know what this is about and I can tell you once again that the cheat script is definitely not making you a better player. I never received any ban during this time as an active Dota 2 player since 2012. Honestly, if I got banned, I would have been more happy cause then I know that Valve can actually detect cheats. There is scripts for many heroes included in this application. You can guess it: Yes you press one button and spam combos for heroes like Tinker, Skywrath, Kunkka, Phoenix, Morphling, Invoker, Meepo, Pudge and more. I Will state from my own experience that you are better off practicing a few days if you wanna land good hooks or sun strikes rather than doing these scripts because honestly, it is just way too complicated to have a third party key setting to think about at the same time. And besides, combos can backslide very hard and you look like an idiot when you are throwing cold snap and tornado on one enemy just to throw chaos meteor on the other one far behind.  [https://imgur.com/gallery/yhGSELo](https://imgur.com/gallery/yhGSELo)

But on smart peoples hands, ***This can be really dangerous.***

**Let me tell you first about the basic and obvious detectable cheats:**

* You can snatch runes automatically but this is detectable during replays if you are not hovering your mouse on the bounty rune.
* You can zoom out the camera as if you were spectating a game but you are playing a ranked game. You can autoblock creeps and this is a total accurate blocking, but still detectable during replays.
* You can afk while jungling with bot and auto buy tomes.
* You can auto stack and auto disable heroes who are trying to blink or attack you.
* You also have the possibility to use exactly **ALL** cosmetic items and weather while playing but this is only showing for yourself.

**Here comes the scary part of that script, The awareness:**

* You can detect wards and sentries placed by the enemy, there is also an indicator showing above your own hero when there is true sight on you. So if you are playing Riki or Bounty or Invoker with ghost walk, you can easily see when they are seeing you and you can avoid gang bang.
* You have an indicator for techies mines and an indicator for enemy mana bars and cooldown of heroes ultis and spells. [https://imgur.com/gallery/ofI9CMy](https://imgur.com/gallery/ofI9CMy)

&#x200B;

* Incoming projectiles such as Pudge hooks, Lina stun, Ancient apparitions ulti, Kunkkas ghostship and torrent, Invokers sun strike, Miranas arrow can all be totally shown to you too and it's honestly VERY scary how accurately you can avoid all spells from being hit and still make it look like it's based on game sense.
* Enemy illusions appear as your own illusions in blue shape, this is just a total F\*\*k you to Phantom Lancer and Naga. [https://imgur.com/gallery/tqPw8gY](https://imgur.com/gallery/tqPw8gY)

&#x200B;

* You also get notifications when and where enemy team smokes or attacks roshan and as if it can't get any worse, you get to see where the enemy is farming in the jungle. [https://imgur.com/gallery/UOQlyK7](https://imgur.com/gallery/UOQlyK7)

Obviously, all these features together with a team, can be VERY VERY dangerous. You will have full control of map and this is honestly just super ridiculous because that script is still being updated. I sincerely hope that this post will mean anything for you as a player because I feel so betrayed, knowing that this shit exists for this long time and as a becoming father in November, I know that my dota days will be easily over soon but I surely hope that Valve will at least make an effort to shut this down. Or at least update dota to not be cooperative with third party applications or SOMETHING.

Thanks for your precious time./P

**Edit**: The response is huge guys and I deeply appreciate your discussions, insights and also all of your sceptical thoughts!

First of all, this is not me trying to advertise cheat in any form. Even though I know the outcome may glorify peoples thoughts and curiosity for cheating. But you know what? Who wouldn't be if it's so damn easy to get your hands on these nasty scripts. I am not blaming anyone who tries.

The real nasty business here is the cheat developers actually making a BIG profit out of this. Heck, let's do some more napkin math here:

Let us assume that 70 000 registered members actually spent 2 dollars once for a week of access to dota 2 cheats. That is still an INSANE amount of 140 000 $! That money could have all gone to TI prize pool.. !

Second. Me stating that 10 out of 10 games having a cheater, should be taken very lightly since it's just a plain assumption without any source. Altough I still believe that cheats are as common as always having a teleport scroll in your inventory.

**I REPEAT**: These cheats will NOT make you a better player! As many people have stated here. Skill overcomes cheaters but it is a true fact that being aware of your enemy team is a big game breaker and therefore, it is a very dangerous feature! Many people here have talked about their friends having these scripts. But imagine a team of full house using scripts together and using communication skills to actually break the game completely to your benefits. That is the real deal I am trying to achieve here.",2020-06-30T23:09:17,LABEL_0,0.5844717025756836

comment,dota2,2020,fvrz85g,hekw1r,"Dear Slacks,  


You are an absolute treasure to this community and we love you. It breaks our hearts to see you like this. I can only imagine how much pain you must feel knowing that all this was going on around you and you are finding out how bad it all really was all in one day. I know there are many in this community who are hurting just like you and feel betrayed by people we once looked up to or supported behaving the way they did. Keep doing what you do and make us laugh and cringe hard. No one does it better than you and we truly admire all the work you put in to making our lives a little easier. Please don't ever change.  


P.S. I'd also like to tell Kyle not to change and to never ever shut up. You are another legend just like Slacks and we need you around for a long long time. Peace.",2020-06-24T03:52:53,LABEL_2,0.5924580693244934

This really hit home with me, man. As someone else who feels a lot of pain through this situation, seeing people who I feel have been a part of my life, my community, have this shit to say is painful. It fucking sucks. I don't want to hear it. But you are right. This needs to happen. These assholes, Grant and *anyone else who has done this shit* need to be exposed and excised from this community. No matter their past contributions or what our impressions of them are from the outside, they need to be removed. We need to grow as a community. We need to get better, be better, together. 

""Let people change you. Get changed by this, it's good. Growth is good, it's one of the best things a human can do.""

Words to live by. /u/SirActionSlacks- You are a fucking treasure and I thank you infinitely for speaking to the people in the middle of this. For giving  us someone who we can empathize with who is struggling to understand all of this the same way we are so that hopefully we can all grow together. Thank you.",2020-06-24T04:14:18,LABEL_0,0.581995964050293
comment,dota2,2020,fvsf2wa,hekw1r,"I disliked Slacks for a long time. I said something about how dumb his build was in Twitch one day while I was checking out his stream (BS lvl 5 dragon rush) and he picked up my comment, read it out loud, and then made fun of me for like 5 minutes straight. He was really mad at me and let me have it. I became a huge fan of this guy after that lol. This video makes me like him even more. 

I love his personal outlook on gaming. Thanks, Slacks. And sorry I made fun of you in Twitch chat. You’re awesome. This stuff does suck and I’m glad there’s someone with a voice in the Dota community calling for reason and willing to show emotion and be vulnerable.",2020-06-24T06:03:04,LABEL_2,0.5256220698356628
