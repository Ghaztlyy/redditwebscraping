Generally goes on for around 30 mins or more where we fiddle around with builds and stuff (seemingly more fun than normal league). Kinda crazy how everyones diving into the details of the fight cause we just slapping rocky foreheads at this point xD. However i did wanna go to the wolves cause we didnt want super minions getting in the way. We always let each other farm up and have a fair fight.

Every system including ribbons, tribunal, etc have been cancelled or failed.

I still believe my idea was great (which is essentially a rip off of GW and WOW).

post,leagueoflegends,2020,h9hxzf,,"I'm almost 43, I just hit Gold, and I have no one to tell it to. TL;DR: I'm old but Gold.

I've been playing League for over nine years now, and the dream always was to be above average. It's not a big dream, but there you go.

When we still had ELO, that meant being above 1200 (I never was). As soon as we had the ranked system, I wanted to be Gold. That's where the shiny borders are. That's where you get skins. That's where you can tell people you're actually kinda decent at this game.

The problem always was that I suck. My already non-existent mechanical skills managed to deteriorate even further after I hit 40. I also can't play every day, since my family and my job come first. And there's always too much happening on the screen for me to follow. I regularly confuse my own character with one of my teammates. I'm incapable of outplaying anyone.

So what I do is play braindead champions in the toplane, disable chat, ward as much as possible, bash towers whenever I can, and let the young folk carry me.

This afternoon it finally happened. I goofed around on Garen a bit while my Draven killed everyone and everything, and at the end of that game I was Gold. I'm absolutely ecstatic, but no one I know plays League. In fact, everyone I know thinks I'm a bit of a twat to still play videogames at my age. But to me this is a big thing.

So there you go. And I'm pretty sure if I can do this, any one of you can too!",2020-06-15T22:57:02,LABEL_0,0.5353337526321411

post,leagueoflegends,2020,g18sl2,,"Riot is forcing me to change my name due to Coronavirus. Hey all, 

So I will try to keep this anonymous as possible, though it's quite hard given my current situation. I've been playing League of Legends for 6 years under the alias Squid Corona - squids are my favourite animal and Corona, believe it or not, is my real life surname. 

As I'm sure everyone is well aware, there is a global pandemic called COVID-19 or, as very inconveniently for me, better known as Coronavirus. Trust me, I've heard all the jokes possible from friends and co-workers. 

At the start of 2019 I managed to change my in-game name to just ""Corona"" as I thought the shorter version of my name was nicer, worked well with telling my real life friends to add me on League, as they all know it's my surname and I think Corona is a cool name so why not have just that. I had to use one of those third party sites to check the name and stay up till midnight in order to secure my family name in League (as a side note, Riot should really consider implementing a bot-detect system to stop name sniping).

I'm by most descriptions a casual player - I play one or two games a day of normal draft pick, almost always with friends just as a way of relaxing after work. On the 1st of April, I try to login to be greeted with a message telling me I need to change my name in order to proceed. I thought it was amusing at first, as almost every game a player would say in chat ""nice name"" to me, but I just shrugged my shoulders and emailed Riot in the hopes of them agreeing that it was a funny situation, and my name would be white-listed. 

After two weeks of back and forth with multiple ""Player Support Specialists"", I was told that they had come to the conclusion that my name would not get white-listed and that I would have to change it if I wanted to keep playing League of Legends. **This is specially stupid since in other regions, players with the name Corona are still active and playing.**

This to me is all very disappointing. I haven't chosen the name ""Corona"" for any reason, and certainly haven't done it during the covid-19 outbreak. I feel like Riot are just sticking a big middle finger to me and telling me that my family name is inappropriate to be a part of their game. I'm posting this to reddit because I want to know if the community really feels offended by the summoner name ""Corona"", or if I'm right in feeling a mild rage and sense of unfairness.

EDIT: here's proof of communication: https://imgur.com/a/OE9l8sc
Proof of ID has also been privately sent.

with the classic ""Challenger Akali Visits Iron4"" Title

And a comment brought to my attention that he intentionally lost 16 games in a row to get to play in this rank so i went and checked it my self

So i Opened op.gg and searched the name of the account he was playing on in the video ""ProfessorIRONxd"" and geuss what there where no account with this name

So i searched the name of his jungler playing zac ""Wreck It Ralph\*\*""\*\* And found the game that had the fed akali in it , which is his only zac game go check it if u want [https://na.op.gg/summoner/userName=Wreck+It+Ralph](https://na.op.gg/summoner/userName=Wreck+It+Ralph)

And i found out that he changed the account name to ""reeeeeeent"" Right after he finished making this video his op.gg [https://na.op.gg/summoner/userName=reeeeeeent](https://na.op.gg/summoner/userName=reeeeeeent)

and if u check this op.gg  ur gonna find that the last 3 games played where akali games that he won (last one played is the one in the video) but before that all of the other games is him going 0/8 ,0/13  etc for 16 games in a row

> I'm gay. I've struggled with my personal identity my entire life. While my parents were working in China, I moved around a lot from homestay to homestay, which is basically where you live in a stranger's home. At the age of 8, I was bombarded with homophobic and sexist remarks at home, and whenever I did something that wasn't ""manly,"" I was told, ""Why are you acting like a girl?"" and to stop being ""gay."" I was hyper-conscious of how I should act and tried not to act or sound ""gay,"" but I was still constantly bullied at school for it. No child should have to feel like they don't belong. Working in the video game industry hasn't helped matters either. On almost every team I've been on, I've heard homophobic comments from either my teammates or the staff and felt uncomfortable, even borderline afraid of possibly losing my job if I told the truth. I'm at a point in my life where I've accepted who I am, and it's taken me a long time to get there. My story is not unique. The gaming industry is rampant with sexism, prejudice, and homophobia. I don't believe there's a quick fix, but it starts with us holding ourselves to a higher standard and treating everyone with dignity. We need to educate people in esports of proper conduct within the workplace. I'm not making this announcement because I owe everyone the details of my personal life, but because I want there to be more awareness about the problems our community faces. Thank you to my parents and friends who have made me feel like I belong. You the real ones.",2022-05-08T02:11:16,LABEL_0,0.695418119430542
post,leagueoflegends,2021,mw8kfy,,"Goodbye, League: A brief love letter from a visually impaired player I was not expecting today to be any different in terms of big life changes, it's really just a Thursday, pandemic seems to be easing up a little... But this morning, as I was playing draft pick, I understood something very painful: It was the last time I would play League of Legends.

I have been experiencing a very sudden process of sight loss due to untreated glaucoma since April 2020 that culminated in me hitting the threshold for legal blindness last December. All throughout the process, I kept playing League, as it was legitimately my favorite game and I had so much fun playing, but the past three months or so have been incredibly taxing, emotionally. I was playing more sporadically because even 15 minutes of straining my eyes leaves me with a migraine, but the more time that went between matches, the more noticeable my sight loss became whenever I logged in and sat for 30 minutes watching my gameplay worsen, the information slowly becoming something I could not parse. It was obviously not just the migraines, but the solidification of the fact that, well, fuck, I am going blind.

I know the community has a reputation for being jaded and toxic, and to an extent, I did get splashes of that experience, but honestly? My experience as a player was overwhelmingly positive. League was something for me to bond over with my real life friends, and a gateway to kind communities where I got to know online friends that would come to matter more to me than words could express. It was rewarding, I could see myself improve with practice, even if I never aimed for a high rank, and sitting down every night to play a few hours was the only thing that kept me going in what have been, quite frankly, a shit couple of years. When I think of League it's never the bad matches that stick with me, it's the neat outplays, the honest conversations about life in voice chat, the delight that came with messing around with builds and meeting people that I had this in common with. 

Today was the day the loss finally hit. I was playing a Lux match, and understanding that even with my main, even with the more contrasting skin I could find, and all the color settings adjusted, and a giant monitor with a magnifier could not do anything about the fact that I just could not play because I could not see anything relevant. No abilities, no health bars, no indicators... My lack of peripheral vision also meant that all my attempts at hitting anything were mostly guesswork. Hell, the only reason I knew who I even was playing was the color of the blurry HP bar that took up a quarter of my monitor. 

I don't think I can kid myself anymore into thinking that things will remain the same even as this huge part of my life changes into something unknown and terrifying. I hate that League of all things was what made me understand how real and irreversible the sight loss is, but it is what it is. So today, I have decided that I have played my last game of League. I did not savor it. I did not prep a goodbye party, and if this is a goodbye speech then it's kind of shitty.

I would still like to make use of this cheesy word vomit to thank League players and the team behind the game. You've brought many things to my life that I hope will remain now that League is no longer in it, and I am grateful. Regardless of what comes next, I will remember these times in my life fondly, and that's pretty much invaluable.

Thank you, it's been great. See you on the flip side.",2021-04-23T00:25:30,LABEL_1,0.4019353985786438

1. Streamer got sniped by 4 people. 2 in her team(Nasus, Jhin) and 2 in the enemy team(Evelynn, Senna)

2. Can't end game by voting surrender since you cannot get the numbers

3. Nasus and Jhin cleared minions to prevent the nexus from being destroyed

Senna and Evelynn prevented her from doing backdoor(Nasus and Jhin tell them where she is)

4. Game goes on for over 3 hours. Death count of streamer was over 120

5. Streamer got banned 14 days by riot (snipers reported her by negative attitude and intentional feeding). Some say why not just leave the game, but she would've got banned for afk then.",2022-07-11T11:29:54,LABEL_0,0.735409677028656

18 minutes jungler and mid afk. I unmute to figure out wtf happened. Mid was mad at jungler for not ganking more. That’s right, the 6/0 jungler wasn’t ganking enough.

We lose that game.

Second game, enemy team gets first blood. Of course my team starts spamming GG at 5 minutes because who wants to play the game at all unless you are absolutely crushing the enemy at all times.

In 2020, Riot started negotiations with Chinese water bottling company Nongfu Spring to take partial ownership to provide much-needed liquidity, hence the introduction of highly OP item Staff of Flowing Water for the 2021 season as payment.

The SQUEEZE HAS NOT YET BEEN SQUOZE. There will be a (LP) ladder attack by Seraphine abusers that could trigger Swain to go down to 40% winrate, BUT DO NOT STOP PLAYING SWAIN. 

Remember back to 2015 Skarner's 70% winrate. We haven't come even close to hitting the peak of Swain's winrate yet. Everyone KEEP PLAYING SWAIN AND WE WILL HIT 70% AND WE WILL ALL COLLECT OUR FREE LP!

comment,leagueoflegends,2020,flhqpw4,fow271,"For anyone interested in the technical details, the setup is a NodeMCU paired with a WS2812 LED strip running WLED software, which receives E1.31 (sACN) data over WiFi, sent by my PC with a custom C# program (what a mouthful). As soon as I get some more work done, I'll make a repository.  

The program is not even remotely done. The main idea is that it will tap on LoL live client data to figure out which champion is being played, and then set up keyboard macros, so that when you press R, a certain animation plays. So you could have different animation sets for Vel'Koz, Evelynn or Xerath. Only Vel'Koz for now because Vel'Koz mains.  
Some people were right in that the animations don't trigger when an enemy is hit, or accounts for channel interruptions, it's just a timer.  

The next step will be integrating it with more stats, such as Health/Mana, to create interesting effects.  

EDIT: I'm absolutely going to create a GitHub repo for this so you can contribute with animations for every champ. As soon as I add support for it and document everything up I'll post a follow-up with the repo link.

post,leagueoflegends,2020,hyr8dn,,"Red Side Cannon Minions have 20 lower attack range than Blue Side ones (for 11 years, since Alpha) I was writing a new wiki page about [unit size](https://leagueoflegends.fandom.com/wiki/Size) the other day. One of the size modifiers that exists is Baron Buff, which only affects minions, but sure enough, this page was about non-champion sizes, too.

So after I set out to determine those modifiers, I also wanted to confirm the attack range increases on the Baron Buff page, which I asked a friend to get me. For the Cannon Minions, he returned '1050/1030 total range'.

I looked at those 2 values the same way you are right now. Nope, this isn't about other minions on any separate map; these are SR cannon minions. The Blue Cannon has 300 attack range; The Red Cannon only has 280 range!

As it turned out, this has been a bug since the earliest builds of the game we have access to; all the way back from Alpha! Minions are coded as separate units for both sides of the map; So are skins, technically, albeit they properly draw from the same data file for the gameplay side (the only differences are tags like 'human' and 'freljord' which VO interactions use). Same types of minions...do not draw from the same file. Not a big problem, though, as they only have to get a few values right? Yes, in theory, that isn't a big problem.

Unfortunately, in the game right now, [**this** is an excerpt the Blue Cannon Minion data file](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/334447591372619778/736725095849918484/unknown.png), and [this is the same excerpt in the data for the Red Cannon minion](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/334447591372619778/736722781516857444/unknown.png). apart from the Name ID's, notice a difference?

And indeed, in the game, these minions adhere to those range values. 

[If you make 2 opposing cannons run into each other without interference, they'll not always start attacking each other at the same time like same-ranged units would](see \*Edit below for why this link is missing) - instead the Blue Minion goes first a lot of times. The reason it doesn't happen always is that 'is my enemy in attack range yet' is checked only so often, which is also why attacking an enemy moves your champion slightly closer than their attack range would require most of the time. Some would argue that that is to aid in chasing/orb-walking, but I don't think it was set up with that in mind. In any case, attack pathfinding at least doesn't path you into Dragon pit if you want to attack someone on the other side of that wall that is in range of Dragon pit at the time, which would be dumb.

###Edit: I got some help in re-doing the proof for this:

Using Syndra W, we can get exact range values and eliminate the *'is my enemy in attack range yet' check* by throwing the minion straight from inside its range to slightly further than it was before. If it attacks without walking, it's inside its attack range; If it nudges forward first, it was thrown further than it's attack range.

[Test with Blue Cannon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KGli9vl6LA) | [Test with Red Cannon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Spxwe27i6P4)

Here is a [comparison for the longest throw at which the minion doesn't nudge forward (= is still in attack range) at.](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/549266844964618242/737305947759837324/unknown.png) The difference isn't large (it's about 5% of attack range against a normal-sized champion), but you can see it [via the cursor location.](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/549266844964618242/737307018922295387/unknown.png)

-

Also, [there's a Ryze bug that made separating these minions kinda annoying yet kind of fun.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmgKH_Aadps) This is the reason you canot port a single Rift Herald, or a single minion period, btw (first minion takes last ported champion's position, or won't get a new location at all if no champion was ported).

-

I tried showing off this difference in the one patch where the new HUD showed unit ranges in the collapsed version (5.14), [however minions all show as 0-ranged anyway due to ((bug))](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/549266844964618242/737283877122343043/unknown.png). Which is sad, maybe someone would have noticed it then already!

-

The fact that blue team seems to generally win when the game is left alone by players entirely might be due to this bug. Blue team also has a higher winrate overall in the game, which is often attributed to the assymetry in HUD and the map, which is reasonable, but I wonder what the impact of this bug has been on that winrate, afterall.

-

\*Edit: Turns out the mentioned tickrates make this way too hard, and upon reviewing the best clip I have, it has minion damage increase due to my target dummies leveling up, so ~~I'll remake this for you with a proof that's less up-to chance.~~

Edit2: Remade proof. Now definitive. See above.

**TL:DR**: [Spot the difference](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/549266844964618242/737282716000714802/Cannon_Minion_data.gif)

All he talked about was League and I had never played a computer game in my life. I did not understand why he couldn't just stop mid-game when I needed him to. I did not understand his love of esports. We were drifting apart.

So, I asked him to teach me how to play.

To say that it was a steep learning curve is an understatement. But I kept at it because I loved him. The more I understood about the game, the closer we got. After some disastrous games on Summoner's Rift (where I was rightly flamed for not knowing how to ping), I switched to just playing ARAM because it forced me to learn what all champions do. It was also more chill.

While I was never very good and never tried playing ranked, I understood enough to enjoy watching the LCK, MSI and Worlds. In 2019, my son and I travelled to Taiwan together to watch both of the semifinals of MSI. It is a memory that I will always cherish.

post,leagueoflegends,2020,gm2hd4,,"The Only Way to Solve Toxicity is with More Sexually Aggressive Skins/Champions The only way to solve toxicity in SoloQ is with more sexually aggressive skins. 
&nbsp;

Think about it. What causes toxicity in Soloq? Toxicity exists because players play the game. However, by having more sexually aggressive skins/champions. By limiting the hands require to play the game to one the toxicity would be reduced literally to 50%. That one toxic player in your team? His toxicity now are reduced to 50%. He call your mom fat? He now calls you mom. 
&nbsp;

#But We already have some and that didn't help
Pool party Taric, Armor of the fifth age Taric, Ahri, Pajama Urgot, Rek Sai, etc. They are all great skins/champions but there is a greater demand than the supply. Everyone has their ""playstyle"" and not all their ""playstyle"" is being fulfilled. So more skins/champions would make players happier. 
&nbsp;

Let's compare real numbers. Not counting PBE let's say toxicity level in Fiddlestick Rework Patch is 10. Right now the toxicity level is 0 on Voibear Rework patch(10.11) as of today. You can even say no one is playing on that patch except Riot Client Programers. This is why I think Fiddlestick should have been reworked to a Waifu that hugs you when he ults and not this little scared farmer's son hiding in the jungle. 

#Real Science behind it
 Freud the father of Psychology says that libido, our sexual desire, drives our every action. Libido has a broader meaning than just sexual desire but it doesn't fit my narrative so I am going to ignore it. Right now League player's libido are not being fulfilled so they try to release it in ways that could be harmful to people around them and themselves. 
 &nbsp;

#Top Lane
Top lane has been recognized as one of the worst roles to play but there is a reason people still play them. If you ask any top laners why they **really** play top lane they would say ""I just want to see two big dudes smashing each other."" This is why people play top. People pick Jax so they can see and feel Jax use his big and necessary large rod against Malphite who is literally just a big bulge. However, this is not enough for some players. When they play jax they imagine themself as Jax smashing Malphite but when they realize they are the one being smashed their mental collapse. Their libido went unfulfilled so they tried to smash anything that is close by which is in many cases their junglers. They smashed Jungler via their chat and well that is how toxicity start. 
&nbsp;

But if Jax or even Malphite has a attractive skin Jax wouldn't need to chat or int to fulfill his libido. He could simply zoom in on his character which he is already doing it anyway. He could just play his best and accept he can't be on top every game and sometimes he have to be bottom. This combine with 50% of hand usage elimination would eliminate toxicity on Top lane. 
#ADC
ADC players are masochists. They like being slaved around by their random braindead partner. They like comparing their suffering to other ADC and enjoy the rush of freedom when eventually their shackle are set free. That high when 0/10 Jinx reached 4 items and is no longer a ranged minion is something no any role can reach. But now that even when you reach 4 items that high is no longer guaranteed. 30 minutes of buildup just to be instantly killed off by a 0/2/99 mid laner. Where does that energy go? That energy that has been built up for the last 30 minutes? Into the chat it goes. 
&nbsp;

People start picking Mages bot not because they are stronger or something(lol) but because they have better skins. Ahri, Vlad, Ziggs, Syndra all have very attractive skins and only MF could really compete against them. Which is probably why MF has one of the highest pick rate and win rate. 
#Mid/Jungle/Support
NO one cares about those roles. They don't do anything in game anyway so there is no need to talk about them. Right now games are decided by Top and ADC. Mid/Jungle/Support has no agency whatsoever compare to Top/ADC so there is no point talking about them. 
#It's time for more Kaisa Skin
Voibear Rework is a step in the right direction. This would fulfill people with questionable desires and hopefully stop them from going outside. Many people libido are being unfulfilled and by giving them champions and skin that matched their disgusting desire they would be happier. Don't ask which demographic they made Yuumi for. For F2P player the Honor System could reward them with skins which would prompt them to think libido in long term and reward holding it in. Streamers should also be encouraged to equipped those skins so the viewers could learn that that is a way to release their libido. I don't think it is right to witch hunt streamers that don't equip those skins since everyone has their own ""preference"" and you never know what the context is. Unless obviously if they play Taric without Pool Party or Gem of the fifth age skin but even then just report them and don't personally attack them.
&nbsp;

#What I am trying to say is: It is time to pull out Pool Part Urgot.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

#Potential Question:
&nbsp;

1. Why does NA have this problem and not Korea?
&nbsp;

A: Cause NA doesn't have Kpop and not having Kpop stars ruling your country is a big disadvantage culturally. Everyone there is playing League to please their Kpop King/Queen so victory is the way they fulfill their libido. 

&nbsp;

2. How about the little blue mens ruining my games??

&nbsp;

A: Those blue men are typically called smurfs and they are actually pro player/coaches trying to scout that Gold 4 Brand that solo killed Faker years ago. Unfortunately, the scout is unsuccessful but still ongoing and now it is almost a part of the game. Just try your best and maybe you can fool them that you are the brand player and get in LCS. Just remember that they are scouting because they are not at Faker's level so just laugh at them desperately trying to scout Faker killer in Iron 2 and being hardstuck at LCS. 

&nbsp;

3. What should I do when other player tries to fulfill their libido on me?

&nbsp;

A: If you are into it you can enter their role play but just don't become the problem trying to solve the problem. Let's say your step-sister is stuck in the bathroom and needs your help. Don't go in and get stuck yourselves. Call the fire department because accidents in the bathroom are dangerous and can break some bones if you are not careful. Sometime the fire department comes too late or never comes. In that case, you should simply lock the door and cover your ear to prevent your sister's dying cry from traumatizing you. Know that even Saints like Voyboy are unsuccessful in helping others get unstuck. Don't get yourself stuck trying to help others because now your stepmom has to come help and it just keeps ongoing.
