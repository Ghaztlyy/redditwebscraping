comment,amongus,2020,g6y9k54,j19w15,"Played public with my mates and I finally got imposter. I killed one in comms while lights where out and suddenly when the body got reported black jumped on me instantly saying that he saw me kill. My other imposter friend jumps in and says how when lights are off and body was found in comms and him and black where together in cams the entire time. 

Black switches it up to saying that he saw me vent, when I never vented that game, and still convinces people that I'm the imposter and voted me off. I couldn't figure out how he knew it was me, how he saw me vent when I never did. I asked him in the lobby after the game finished and he began dodging the question and just gloat saying that I got ""detectived"". 

He then fucked up by letting it slip that him and the guy I killed where brothers playing together. That's when I had two options. Ban him from lobby for ghosting, or I could play the long game and wait til the game where he gets imp just so I can randomly vote him off. Of course, being the adult, I decided to just tell him he ghosted and ban him.

A couple EMs later, and Blue still won't vote for Pink, and of course Pink is making sure the vote stays tied. So, Black gestures for me to follow him, and starts doing a med scan with just me in the room. Like, ""Bro, I already know it's not you. You need to be doing this in front of Blue!!!""

My head cannon is that they‚Äôre human-like being genetically altered to be smaller, live longer, and age slower so that they can handle long distance space travel or difficult situations while needing less resources to remain alive. (This is how I explain them in my fanfic I wrote).

comment,amongus,2020,g6usz6g,j0pjux,Crewmates are aliens and impostors are evolved humans . The evolution occured due to some catastrophe and hence they can shapeshift. The crewmates land on Earth in search of alien life and while searching left over humans kill the wandering crewmates and shapeshift into them. It is hard to do any action action while in different form and hence killing crewmates simultaneously is not possible. Humans(impostors) now are going to invade the planet of crewmates. But due to some reason a crewmate finds out that some of them are impostors. He/she tells everyone. Impostors have to kill all the crewmates so that the crewmates on the ship would not be able tell that information to their planet's head. To stop this information to transfer impostors have to kill every crewmate before reaching the planet. But to reach the planet the ship they are travelling from must be repaired so that it is capable of doing a hyperjump through space. And so the game starts.....,2020-09-27T23:18:56,LABEL_0,0.6047347187995911

Finally I catch a break following a guy I was sus of and happened to see him vent. He clearly didn't see me. 

I made my way to the button and realized I'd used my only meeting to bitch at people to just get their tasks done. So now I had to wait until someone reported a body, minutes later.",2020-10-26T01:06:27,LABEL_0,0.8556430339813232

Wearing a Dark Brown space suit with a color-matching (when they're writing it says ""mathing"") backpack. He was promptly seen wandering the weapons area of the Skeld ship seemingly watching every passerby intently as they went on their duties. As soon LIME, a newer crewmember onboard the Space-voyaging, had arrived within arm's reach of BROWN, BROWN promptly revealed a hidden 4-inch switch-blade from the rear pockets of his space suit, and used it to violently stab LIME near the spine roughly 6 times. LIME bleed out within seconds and was pronounced dead at the scene, and I watched as BROWN stood without remorse after having murdered LIME
