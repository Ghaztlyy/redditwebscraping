I am really happy to bring you this animated handbook, really, Klee is so cute!  This is what the team said on bilibili: I am really happy to bring you this animated handbook, really, Klee is so cute! As the introduction said, almost all of the painting department was dispatched this time. After countless sleepless nights, the painters basically painted until the early hours of the morning, and the chief painter even worked through the night  to the next morning for an average of four and five days a week . All this just wants to bring more excellent works.  
The total number of original paintings excluding repeated frames, pixels and other materials basically exceeded 600. Hope you all like it, and we will continue to work hard in the future! Looking forward to your Sanlian（bilibili meme） and subscribe! After the number of  collecting reach 2W, we will release some HD original wallpapers and GIFs in the channel\~! Thanks for your support!

More dances: 

[Everybody dance with pancakes](https://www.reddit.com/r/Genshin_Impact/comments/kmnfx0/everybody_dance_with_pancakes_helltaker_ost/) 

[Xinyan plays her guitar and dances with ducks](https://www.reddit.com/r/Genshin_Impact/comments/kopagh/xinyan_ducktales/)

I did the dance with every character I have in their respective places, but sadly the song I wanted was too short! So I included only eight of them. Also if I had Klee, I would put her in the end instead (probably in Jean's office or near the lake/river, haha).

I'm sorry I deleted my first post with only Amber dancing at 500 upvotes, but I had to sacrifice that one silver medal to improve the content before it got somewhat popular.

comment,Genshin_Impact,2021,gpr5709,ly51e9,"Do people enjoy using Amber? Legitimate question. 
I don't care about meta at all.

I like to take my low level characters into lower abyss floors just to have fun with them/give them another chance (this is how I realized I fricking love Kaeya). 

And I like Amber, I always did, but she just feels a bit sluggish compared to my Fischl and Ganyu (aka the other two archers I have). Plus, the amount of times that Baron Bunny fails to hit its target due to being battered around/enemies moving away from it is just annoying.

Every character in this game can be fun and OP, so I'm pretty sure I'm just doing something wrong with her since she's basically the only character I don't really like using.

comment,Genshin_Impact,2020,g80uqe6,j6sdsb,"She's at least S tier in the Prologue, where you need to hunt, shoot the flying puzzles, blow up barrels from afar, snipe Ruin Guards, light torches, burn down the Dendro shield of the Mitachurl (of which there are MANY in the Prologue), and burn the flower of the dendro slime. Having all this in one single character is invaluable when traversing the world because you get more slots for other characters to do other things.

Take it from me, I took the advice of the tierlist guys and swapped her out for ""better heroes"" and my team comp SUFFERED in the Prologue because of it. I let out a huge groan everytime I saw the shielded Mitachurl and wished Amber was on my team. I dont even think Fischl + Xiangling can satisfy the role she fills because that's TWO characters doing the work of one.

Remember, Tier lists are ONLY for Spiral Abyss where very specific things are asked for. Amber is S tier in traversing, which is what you'll be doing for the majority of the game until you reach Spiral Abyss.",2020-10-08T01:43:14,LABEL_1,0.47398439049720764

comment,Genshin_Impact,2021,hem2989,px7rxz,"Not gonna lie, I'm *greatly* enjoying this complete meltdown.

Reddit is nothing but posts about review bomb, Discord is full of Qiqi spam, even some fucking news outlets are reporting the outrage. The backlash is splashing over to even Honkai, lol.

I'm very curious what reactions are like in CN and how things will go. As funny as it would be if it just kept going, realistically, people will go back to spamming Gouba in a few days, Google will fix the review bomb and things will probably die down...

Buuut, considering how big this meltdown is, trying to shove it under the rug may not (And hopefully will not) just work. Many players are claiming to either quit the game or go F2P, and the inevitable radio silence about the whole issue could drive people to actually follow through.

I don't think we'll see immediate effects...But I'm very curious to see how things will be going forward. Will people actually just forget and move on, or will this truly have long-term consequences for Mihoyo? There's no doubt that this whole ordeal will leave a bad taste in people's mouths...Especially after 2.1 being a giant pile of controversies as is.

Find out, on the next episode of Genshin Impact Anniversary Drama!
