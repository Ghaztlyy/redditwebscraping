comment,overwatch,2020,fzkdbu1,hznm1a,"I love this idea, but by default it would let these players know when their team DIDN'T win...which will let some people justify their leaving, so it isn't a good idea. We just need penalties to kick in sooner, not after like 9 QP leaves.


**Edit: The comment below from Urgalicious should simply be a thing:**

>""If you leave a match, even if it's QP, then requeing should put you back in that match. If it gets backfilled? Sorry, can't que until the match finishes.""",2020-07-29T07:23:05,LABEL_0,0.5340657234191895
comment,overwatch,2020,fzkbeg5,hznm1a,"I can't tell you how many times I've experienced this, especially in Mystery Heroes. Someone would be toxic, complain about teammates, leave the game after 1 round of control, 1 minute into the game, or even when there's 1 minute left.

Then after they leave, the backfill comes in and we end up winning. :) Obviously I've been on the other end too when we're stomping them, they have quitters and their backfill comes in to even up the score. Anyway! I've been tempted on a few occasions, depending on what they said in voice or message chat to say, ""Thanks for leaving because we won.""

They basically shot themselves in the foot. 5v5 has already shown it requires complete reworks of several characters, massive nerfs and buffs and constant trial and error. Not to mention, probably reworking the unreleased characters as well. They should have just released the game 6v6 with some unique kit changes and then slowly gone to 5v5 by simply adding it in the arcade and letting the public test it out over months by simply playing it until they felt confident in it going live. As it is, they're taking a MASSIVE risk by doing 5v5, which could essentially *tank* the game on release if people find it's just no longer fun to play.

comment,overwatch,2022,itvl2t3,ye16uv,"Hello all.

I commented on the original post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/ydp56j/blizzards_current_store_practices_are_illegal_in/itvhmkk/) and I'll be mirroring my comment below:

That post is a ""call to action"".  We do not allow users to encourage others to harass, report, accuse, or witchhunt other people on the subreddit. This was re-emphasised this point when there was a huge call for boycotts at launch.  Again, we don't care if you boycott the game, don't pay for skins, or want to report Blizzard for whatever, we just don't want the 'mob mentality' requests to get others to do the same thing.

The responsibility for the removal is mine, which you can blame me for.  I had to walk away in the middle of the removal, didn't get a chance to finish it, and couldn't get back to it in a timely manner.  I've apologized to the mod team and will apologize directly to r/Overwatch.  It won't happen again.

-SG

EDIT: Concerning some of the removals of requests for information, a lot of them have been automatically removed by Automod due to reaching a threshold of reports.  Automod automatically posts a removal in these instances stating the following: 

> **Your post has been removed automatically for the following reason:**

> Your submission has reached the maximum amount of reports and sent to the mod team for manual review. If the post is not in violation of the subreddit's rules, it will be restored. Otherwise, the post will remain removed.

> I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please contact the moderators of this subreddit if you have any questions or concerns.

DOUBLE EDIT:  I'm off to work now, so I'll try to get to everybody's comments in a little bit.  The mod team wanted me to add a few things to this comment:

1) The removal is not to block feedback about the monetization of OW2.  The issue is specifically with the inclusion of the contact information and instructions on how to report them.  This is the call to action, not the discussion of the law.

2) The original intent behind the ""no calls to action"" ruling was to address problems with vote manipulation or raiding (per sitewide rules).  Sometimes it's applied to other areas, particularly in cases where subject matter is repetitive or already well-known.  In this case, Blizzard's monetization issues is extremely well known (see: this sub since launch).

 Have we applied this incorrectly in this case?  Possibly.  We'll discuss over the next few days and probably update our guidelines with more information moving forward.

In the meantime, we are going to have an updated sticked thread for bugs and duplicate content so we'll be able to provide users with more information as to the repetitive issues with OW2.",2022-10-27T01:02:29,LABEL_0,0.49590563774108887

comment,overwatch,2022,itbxccu,yamvac,There’s a difference between “best support” and a grade A healbot. A great example is baptiste. You can be non stop healing the entire game and end with 30k healing but if your ultimates are poorly timed or placed and your lamps are poorly timed and placed and you don’t know when to shoot people rather than topping people off 24/7 then you can justifiably be considered bad in that situation. I personally wouldn’t look at someone with 30k healing and call them bad just because they’re still an anchor and making the game fun for their team but that doesn’t automatically mean you’re the best player in that particular match. It’s the inverse to the Winston or sombra issue. You’re stats may not be the best they may even look bad but you could absolutely be popping off and winning the game for your team by zoning and being a constant threat or some otherwise untracked hard to recognize action,2022-10-22T21:48:12,LABEL_1,0.48483380675315857

comment,overwatch,2022,itr9hgb,ydcccg,"> But I think we should all take a moment to appreciate a certain dapper looking gentleman that has been holding the Overwatch team together since day one. Yes you guessed it, it's none other than Jeffrey R. Kaplan, the big dog himself. We all know that I am the heart and soul of this community, and without me, uhm, the Overwatch team would collapse faster than the floor on Petra. These are undisputable facts that you should never forget.

comment,overwatch,2022,itsgvtr,ydcccg,"Lootboxes sucked, sure, but you could at least earn them for free and they had a good chance of paying out amounts of currency that actually pushed you much closer toward being able to buy the legendary skins you wanted (especially when dupes refunded currency). OW was also on sale for $10 for a while there, and usually $20 besides.

But THIS system?

8 months of dedicated weekly grinding for ONE skin, with a battle pass that refunds 0 premium currency and is mostly filler...?

No progression besides BP and comp rank (both of which reset seasonally) to push you toward buying the BP?

FFS, meet us halfway, here: Fortnite and Minion Masters refund huge chunks of premium currency in the BP and have more reliable ways to earn it besides, which makes me feel far more inclined to spend money.

OW2? I feel Bobby's grubby little goblin fingers reaching out of the monitor and groping around the room for my wallet...",2022-10-26T07:38:57,LABEL_1,0.4539045989513397
comment,overwatch,2022,itt5ofx,ydcccg,"I honestly despise the F2P model that so many companies adopt, and (to an extent) the people who enable it by forking out hundreds/thousands of dollars on these stupid cash grabs. Bar a few games (LoL and Apex come to mind), all of these games with shitty F2P models always suffer because of it. I agree that gameplay comes first in any competitive game, but the reality is that having some kind of progression outside of that is nice. 

There are so many other small aspects of this game that feel like they've just downgraded, especially in the HUD. Why isn't our account level displayed anymore, and why doesn't it go up as we play. Why can we not even see our own (and teammates) ranks when we are in comp games? Why did they remove the on-fire feature that was literally just a 'feel good' feature.  Maybe there is some upgrade they are gonna add in, but the reality is that they're either gone for good or they'll end up adding them to some kind of shitty new battle pass as filler content between the mediocre skins.",2022-10-26T10:51:35,LABEL_0,0.8984483480453491

I spend money on tons of games, including buying lootboxes back in OW1. But the experience as a free player in OW2 is actually *discouraging* me from spending. 

I think the difference is that most games give free players a steady stream of ""regular"" stuff, and then dangle the extra-cool items as a temptation to break out your wallet. It feels good to get new things and build a collection, so spending a bit to add that one special skin to your vault isn't too much of a leap.

But if I have to pay for *everything*, even the regular stuff? It makes me not want to spend at all. It doesn't feel like I'm ""completing my collection"" anymore, it just feels like I'm getting taken advantage of. Fuck that.",2022-10-25T05:04:44,LABEL_0,0.584999680519104
