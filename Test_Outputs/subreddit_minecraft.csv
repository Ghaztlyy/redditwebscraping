comment,minecraft,2020,frqyuky,gq1gid,"If we apply this to the Minecraft world, using the Farlands as borders for the world (As in walking from across the entire Minecraft world from Farland to Farland would be like walking the equator) then we know that the circumference of the world would be 25,122,058 meters round. Dividing by 2 pi to get the radius would give us 3,998,299 meters as the radius. Converting to km would be 3,998.299 of course. 

Interestingly this makes the Minecraft world smaller than our own, as the Earth's radius is between 6,357 and 6,378 km. 

Then to find how far down the Nether would have to be for this image to be true, we use the equation (Suface Length) = (Radius) * (Angle). We can apply that to both the Surface level and the Nether level, giving us the equations 8 = 3998.299 * (Angle) and 1 = (Nether radius) * (Angle), respectively. As the angle is consistent between the equations, we can instead rearrange the equations to find angle and then set them equal to each other. This gives us 8 / 3998.299 = 1 / (Nether radius). Solving for this we can find the Nether radius is equal to 3998.299 / 8 which is equal to 499.78 km.

This means that the Nether would be about 3,498.519 km below the surface.

Similarly, applying all of that to Earth's measurements it would mean the Nether would be about 5,571.5625 km below the surface, for reference that is well within the solid Inner Core of Earth.",2020-05-25T15:36:36,LABEL_1,0.7253984808921814

The only flaw I can see with this is that portals don't always go to the coordinates that would be directly below them. So really you're just saying that the surface area of the nether is 1/8th (edit: actually 1/64th, but you understood what I meant to say anyway) of the overworlds. These surfaces can still be configured in any way because portals can be connected in any way, not just straight down.

First of all: Thanks to [u/Jacobletrashe](https://www.reddit.com/user/Jacobletrashe/) for giving me [the inspiration](https://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/joqo0x/and_now_we_wait/).

Secondly: Thanks to the original builder from 2013: [Tatoa38](https://www.planetminecraft.com/project/statue-of-liberty-2320870/)

Thirdly: Thanks to everyone giving me awards! You've made my day!

Since lot's of people are saying this is done using ""*/gamerule randomtickspeed"".* This isn't right. Tickspeed doesn't affect copper. I used a custom script that I made for 1.16 to speed up the whole game, apparently it also worked for this snapshot. This script makes the game run a lot faster. Also in the menu screen (example: [https://imgur.com/a/C5F4905](https://imgur.com/a/C5F4905))

I sped my game up by 80 times and it took 1 hour to completly oxidize the whole statue. It takes somewhere between 50 and 84 hours to change from brown/orange to fully oxidized.

Here is a version with a day/night cycle. **Epilepsy warning though!** [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlhZezkoIpU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlhZezkoIpU&feature=youtu.be&ab_channel=steve)",2020-11-06T18:17:06,LABEL_2,0.585580050945282

comment,minecraft,2020,fpkq5tj,ge1uww,"I plan on adding icons for the elytra, dyed leather armor, and animated icons for enchanted armor. If you guys like it I will include a link to download once it's fully finished.

Also, yes, although I didn't include it in the post above, I made a turtle shell icon as well:  [https://imgur.com/qphs8Cl](https://imgur.com/qphs8Cl)  So cute!

EDIT to clarify a few things: As I have said in a couple of comments down below, this is in fact a resource pack and data pack combo. Both will need to be installed.

Also, I apologize for the wait, but I don't want to publish an unfinished product. I have been working with a few other Minecrafter friends of mine on this project, and we have recently ran in to a big problem that a fellow redditor messaged me to warn me would happen when different types of armor are put on. We are currently testing some creative solutions and are trying to finish this as soon as possible. Thanks for your patience!

EDIT2: Looks like it's a bust, guys. Me and my friends have tried a lot of different ways to fix the game breaking bugs that this pack poses, but no matter what it doesn't seem like it'll work. Sorry for leading you guys on, I really thought this gamechanging pack would work. Hopefully someone more clever than us will eventually be able to figure out how to circumvent the bugs. Until then, thanks for your understanding.

Silver for partial credit :)

Edit 2: I guess I should clarify that I used commands for this, no actual programming

Edit 3: Someone got it! The command block summons an area effect cloud, and that area effect cloud sets the block to air. It checks the adjacent blocks and if the block is stone, it summons another one of itself at that block. The new area effect clouds execute the same function and spread throughout the stone. The statue is made out of infested stone so it doesn't get deleted or spread to.

comment,minecraft,2020,gaortjr,jl2bwb,"For everyone who has questions (and for the people who don't believe it was made in survival):

* I have no point in lying. If it was made in creative, the result would have been the same, and people would still have liked it. I wanted to create it in survival firstly because I wanted to flex on my friends (on the bottom left of the picture). Also, building it in survival makes me way more proud of it, and the process of building it was part of the journey, and I enjoyed it!
* I did it alone. Our server is new, so I had to create farms (gold farm to max out beacons to mine blocks way faster, and stone generator), and I like to count it in the process. [My friends helped me gather ressources for the planets](https://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/jl2bwb/my_biggest_survival_build_50_hours_and_60000/gamjjiu?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), so it took only 1 to 1.5 hour to pick blocks in a desert, a gravelly mountain, and a mesa. Also, for everyone talking about pickaxes... *Mending*.
* [Here are the game statistics](https://i.imgur.com/kGOoHDg.png). There is 2 screenshots because I used 2 accounts, because my first account was stolen (don't put the same password on every website lol) then given back to me 2.5 weeks later (yikes that felt long, thanks u/Taledo for the temporary account).
* The process took *only* 50h (and I know how many blocks I needed) because of great planning. Also, as I already said, the process was the following:

1. create a 3D model for the man (I downloaded a free 3D model of a man and learnt how to use Blender to edit it);
2. convert it to blocks (as a schematic) using a voxelizer (I used [this one](http://drubutu.com/miscellaneous/voxelizer/));
3. import it on my word as a schematic using Litematica (also learnt how to use it);
4. gather the blocs and place them following the hologram;
5. for the planets, convert a sphere to blocs adding each texture with the same voxelizer;
6. edit the blocks in a creative world because it looked very bad, then create new schematics;
7. then step 3 & 4 again.
8. PS: [everything is hollow](https://imgur.com/a/rdRSp6o), so that's why it didn't take more time.

* I had the time to do it because online classes, and because quarantine. I enjoyed doing it. And for all hater saying I'm unemployed and stuff, I just signed my apprenticeship contract for the year!

Good day folks, and thanks for the ride! Also, thanks for all the kind comments, and all the awards and upvotes <3

comment,minecraft,2020,g4t0z6p,iqm3q9,"It‚Äôs because you‚Äôre 49 blocks high and most minecraft blocks are cubes and each cube has *square* faces and the *square* root of 49 is 7.

Now how many different heights did you die from in the boat in this video? Just one, and 7-1=6.

You attempted it from *three* different heights so if we take the digit 6 and use it *three times* in a row we get 666, the number of the beast.

And the beast wants your soul.

And that‚Äôs why you die from height 49 in a boat.

comment,minecraft,2020,fkdzbsf,fhx8dl,"This is part of my ongoing love-hate relationship with snow biomes. Sometimes snow generates above holes in the ground like ravines or mini-caves and watering holes. Since you can't actually walk on snow, this means that snow biomes are filled with invisible death-traps that can only be detected by clearing the snow on every block before you step on it. Since nobody does that, this means that occasionally when walking in a snow biome you'll suddenly just fall through the snow without warning into a pit full of zombies, or fall into a ravine and die. And the best part is that the snow doesn't break when you fall through it, so you'd better know exactly where the invisible hole is or you're never getting your stuff back.",2020-03-13T19:59:04,LABEL_1,0.4277966618537903

comment,minecraft,2021,gx83219,n6n04u,"Well, now I don't feel like such an odd ball for enjoying Minecraft at 65.

ETA: OH wow thanks for the hugs and awards. To me Minecraft is much more than 'just a game'. It's one of those unique games that offers building skills, architecture, programming, etc. I run a couple of servers for some of my friends kids, and of course myself as well haha.

On my personal server, I have the goal of building a massive infrastructure with accompanying hamlets that have their own economies et al. So far I have the main infrastructure I am working on (which is pretty massive right how, and I have 50 fully fledged hamlets and villages thriving.....well except for raiders keep plundering the goodies.

I've 'played' Minecraft since if first came out, and I am thoroughly hooked. So, you can call me nerdy for enjoying a simplistic game on the surface, but oh so involving once you dip into the deep end of the pool.

Right now I'm trying to 'shoot video' of the whole set up...but replay mod confuses me. I'll get it tho, and then I can trot around my pony in proper fashion with all the cool kids. LOL

Thanks again guys and gals.

ETA2: Still figuring out Reddit's changes made to replies. Used to be I could go down the list and upvote all replies. That seems to have changed. At any rate, I want to personally thank all who replied. You guys and gals are the best.

ETA3: Thanks for all the awards. I'm not sure why they were bestowed on me, but thanks just the same.",2021-05-07T09:40:03,LABEL_2,0.868590772151947
