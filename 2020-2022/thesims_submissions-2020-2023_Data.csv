You'll notice some fencing is invisible in some areas because my game was glitching - admittedly after numerous experimentation with the foundations - but I thought I'd share this anyway as an accomplishment for the year.

They literally pulled all dayers and all nighters for their term papers and presentations and for their homework. 

Tell me why they all got straight F‚Äôs in all their classes!!! This makes no sense to me. I‚Äôve read past posts that living on campus makes them later to class but that‚Äôs so dumb especially if their homework is finished. So now they‚Äôre all suspended.

thesims,2020,1,"So, I created a Sim and started a family with Caleb. A few days of gaming later we had two vampire children.
(My created character already died, Caleb is still alive and I intend to keep him).

One of them is not a vampire anymore and has become a master spellcaster. Also reached top of mechanical engineering career (went to college) and quit, changing to cientist. He had a child, that is now a (human) teen.

The other child of my first couple is still a vampire, finished Drama School and is now an Actress.

I really wish I could continue the family - because I never had a really long lineage and wanted to do this for once -, but I'm out of ideas.

I have all the expansions packages and am willing to download mods. Also, the family has A LOT of money, so not a problem to start a low-paying job or not having a job.


Anyone has any ideas? Any history I could follow?
Thanks!!",1577849033
thesims,2020,1,"Okay so if I learnt to code, I'd love to bring this mod to life, because it seems like I can't find one anywhere. If anyone can suggest one, I'd be so thrilled.

I've got the Sacrifical Mod regard tradegy but it really isn't anything great, like even on the slowest setting, sims are dying left right and centre to some random murderer and it's doing my nut in.

But is there a mod out there that actually implements the random chance of contracting an illness that can actually end a Sims life? 

I have MC but don't want to do it out of my own choice, I'd love to be minding my own business and suddenly - Sim has a life threatening illness and that's it, a week or two go by and then they die. Or maybe something Chronic that affects them everyday, or something even less serious that affects their energy so it really feels like they're ill.

I've seen mods for mental health issues too but they're not great.

thesims,2020,1,"I do love looking at sim content but recently I uninstall sims 3 from my computer. I also uninstall sims 4 a long time ago. What's been bugging me is how EA design these games and literally could improve both games but don't bother! I see online constantly people are blaming developers solely you can't entirely blame them. EA higher ups have the say on what they do with the games. Just witnessing how sims 4 is going downhill all through 2019. Made me think about the sims 3 and realize sims 3 major setbacks. Realizing all these issues I can't seem to enjoy playing the sims anymore.

I'm so bored with sims 4 so I don't bother. Literally yesterday I try to start up a family legacy challenge again in sims 3. But I eventually felt ""why bother the family tree always gets mess up and over time family members don't know each other"" (a big issue I have with sims 3). I just left the game and then eventually decided since I'm not enjoying sims 3 I should uninstall and plus my computer is now faster. Also, I watch a video of a youtuber talking about EA ruining their game series. They mention the sims at one point. I realize EA is the biggest problem right now with the series. I don't want to even bother getting upset about the issues anymore. Hell I don't want to spend my money on the sims anymore.

Recently I bought a ton of new games from different developers (all were on sale) and I realize. Simmers who are upset with how the sims is should just stop playing and buy new games off steam instead and enjoy those games.  I was just wondering are there any other people feel the same way about EA? and they don't want to bother buying sims 5 either? Personally I think I still to watching content about the sims but no more investing my time or money into the sims series.",1577884577

Most recently I've been playing as a vampire family (mom, son, and daughter). I sent the daughter to Foxbury once she aged up, and it was really fun! First three semesters were great and she kept her grades up too. Got most of the way through her final semester when she DIED. 

She was literally ONE DAY, ONE FINAL from graduating, and she dies. The daughter had two classes and then I had her do her presentation before heading home. It was sunny, so I had to use the make happy cheat between the last class and the presentation so her energy didn't deplete from sun exposure. Still, it got low enough that it was flashing red, and the make happy cheat didn't get rid of that for some reason?? So she runs home (with full energy, still flashing red), walks in the door, is fine for .5 seconds, then turns around and walks out and DIES. I'm so pissed. 

After this, I sent her mom to her apartment to get her headstone, but it wasn't there. I'M SO MAD",1577933708

thesims,2020,1,"The holiday season got me thinking a lot about how seasons and holidays work in The Sims 4, and in December I watched a streamer who had his holidays and seasons set up a lot like in real life. I thought it was a pretty interesting idea, so I'm going to start using that setup.

He has LittleMsSam's 21 day seasons mod. This makes it so that there's 12 sim-weeks in a sim-year. Which means that each sim-week corresponds to a real-life month. This makes it easy to just plop the major holidays of a month inside the corresponding week. For instance, the first sim-week (i.e. real-life month) of Winter would be December. So, I'd put Winterfest and New Year's Day in that week.

Then I just count the ""months"" from there. Week 2 of Winter is January, week 3 of Winter is February, etc. This way, I know that, for example, October is the second week of Fall, and Spooky Day goes at the end of October. November is the third week of Fall, and Harvestfest falls on the last (and, in this case, only) Thursday of the week.

Therefore, I decided to make up a challenge that can be completed in one Sim lifetime for those of you may have similarly short attention spans. There are no real rules as this is meant to be fun, but obviously the less you cheat, the more difficult the challenge is.

The idea of this challenge is that your sim aspires to be a world-famous celebrity in the culinary field, mastering the culinary arts and making their way to fame and fortune!

I have not yet completed this challenge but have been using cheats on it so far ‚Äì if you try it without cheats and find it‚Äôs not possible, let me know and I will adjust accordingly! Also, I am looking for suggestions/critiques on the challenge ‚Äì particularly about what the point metrics should be for the ‚ÄúRestaurant‚Äù points category. Thanks in advance!

thesims,2020,1,"As the title says, I was poking around some old files (trying to find Star Trek uniform CC I remembered downloading) and found probably the first-ever populated world I made in CAW. So naturally I opened it to see what was in it, and there was some... interesting stuff:

\- Four house templates for the entire neighborhood. None of them were coordinated inside. The four templates were a shipping container trailer, a log cabin that was really a very small apartment, and two family homes.

\- The rest of the lots were EA made lots. All the apartments and community lots.

\- One of the EA lots, a school, had a subway entrance stuck one tile away from the school entrance.

\- I hadn't figured out how to snap the road and lots to a grid in CAW so none of the lots were flush against the road, and sometimes the road clipped through the lots.

\- Lots of sim families I didn't recognize. Only 5 of these families made it intact to my current Sims world canon, and another made it mostly intact but their relationships with other families were changed.

\- A knockoff version of my own family I have no recollection of making

\- Chuck Norris

\- A dozen townies and NPCs with the last name Santos. None were related to each other though I'm pretty sure at least two were supposed to be.

\- A sim called the ""world's laziest vampire""

\- Fandom sims that I have no recollection of making

\- Fandom sims that I do remember making, however I had changed their names to attempt to disguise the fact that they were fandom sims

\- A family whose family description straight up called them ugly (they were)

\- Sims named Albert Einstein and Harry Houdini who looked nothing like their namesakes

\- A mixologist named ""KitchenAid Mixer""

\- Mailmen named ""Fed Ex"" (woman) and ""US PS"" (man)

\- Pizza deliverymen named ""Pizza Hut"" (woman) and ""Domino's Pizza"" (man)

\- Newspaper deliveryboys named ""Wall Street Journal"" and ""New York Times""

\- Burglars named ""Sticky Fingers"" (man) and ""Clept O'Gurll"" (woman)

i make a folder on desktop called Sims Backups  


now, i made a copy of 2 each and called them Origin Sims and Ea sims  


i moved the sims from EA1 to origin1, replacing all files  EA1 now empty  


moved Origin2 to EA2, replacing all files. origin2 folder now empty  


now, run the game, one at a time

Memory: 8 GB 2133 MHz

Startup Disk: Macintosh HD

Graphics: Intel Iris Plus Graphics 640 1536 MB

With the addition of University, allowing you to have ‚Äòroommates‚Äô, I figured that I could use the ‚Äò4 up - 4 down‚Äô model to build a large luxury apartment building and assign beds to sims to dictate which belonged to who (you can have a maximum of 8 NPCs I believe, not including yourself - correct me if I‚Äôm wrong)

The plan being to have all the apartments on the 1st, 2nd and 3rd floor with a ‚Äòrestaurant‚Äô on ground level, next to reception (okay, so just a kitchen with lots of tables and chairs - but, with Dine out stuff to look like an actual restaurant).

Long story short, I‚Äôm sinking a huge amount of time into this to make it look amazing and be functional.

So far, 3 apartments complete (out of 9), just one floors worth. And the reception area and I‚Äôve managed to hit $640,000 simoleons. This build will likely be between $2m and $3m when complete. 

Any ideas or guesses on likely bills?

1. So, every world is like a town? Can I live in Newcrest and visit the other maps?
2. Do they all have their own community buildings already?
3. Can I place just homes in the available lots and visit other worlds/towns community lots, like gyms, parks, library and whatnot? 
4. Or do I have to balance between homes and community lots in my world (Newcrest)---I saw that in Edit World  you can change a the type of a lot to ""community?""

I hate that the neighborhood doesn't matter; I'd like to see more local Sims when I'm in Oasis Springs or San Myshuno. I also hate that it's always the same, fairly short list of Sims. Although I like the notion that there are gym regulars, it just doesn't feel true to life. I also wish I had some control over who and and aren't regulars.

I know the MC Population and NPCC mods can influence population, but I suspect I'm not using them right. (I eventually pulled NPCC because I got the sense it was interfering with MC Pop.)

i started a sims game, and i‚Äôm on my third generation. it‚Äôs going great and i‚Äôm really enjoying playing this way, especially because i can never seem to make it past a single generation. however, over three generations and a month and a half (real time) of me playing the game, my worlds have gotten really messy and i hate it. i also have all these hideous townies running around and it‚Äôs awful. 

i want to reset the world. back to how it is when you start the game, but i don‚Äôt want to lose any progress i have right now. i tried doing this by saving my family to the gallery and starting a new game. however, this kept my funds and skills, but it took away my family
inventory (where i keep graves, family photos) and i lost my family tree. 

i imagine this is impossible, but i thought it wouldn‚Äôt hurt to ask.",1578113233

thesims,2020,1,"This is in no way meant to harm or upset non-Sim people. This is my opinion only. 

  \* Vampires ‚Äì they STILL can‚Äôt do laundry. No Maxis, I‚Äôm not using the disgustingly glitched ‚Äúdryer‚Äù, which almost always catches fire, unless your sim has over 9000 handiness to ensure the fires don‚Äôt happen on a daily basis. For the sake of all energy-aware Vampires, let them place laundry on the clothesline.

\* Mourning ‚Äì I get it, someone close to you dies and you become sad. At this stage, the continuous death cycle in an aging simulation should cause grief in some Sims, but not every Sim! My Sim doesn‚Äôt need to have a life-altering debuff for TWO DAYS from the death of a sim she met once. Yes there should be a debuff, no it shouldn‚Äôt last for two days, yes you should gain a mourning debuff for appropriately related sims or appropriately strong relationships/friendships and no we shouldn‚Äôt be punished for wanting continuity in our Sims universe. Death happens, but chill out. 

\* Cemetery ‚Äì Speaking of death, where the hells bells is our cemetery lot? I feel like we‚Äôre being punished again for playing a game that simulates an aging pixelated population. Imagine the ability to visit a cemetery with your loved ones graves, place them lovingly and buy flowers from a stall vendor (an amazing opportunity to utilise the useless flower arranging skill), strengthen connections with past matriarchs and patriarchs, a peaceful place where children, teens and elders could come and sit to chat with their forgotten loved ones. While you‚Äôre at it Maxis, give us a designated Cemetery lot with additional lot traits i.e. Peaceful Place ‚Äì no angry or mean spirits reside here, Haunted ‚Äì a place where the mean and angry reside, etc. In addition to any kind of lot traits, bring back the good old Sims 3 Crypt; let our sims explore an underground world filled with spooky ghosts and walking skeletons (utilising the beauty of another expansion and it‚Äôs concepts - Selvadorada), let them fight their way to untold ancestral treasures or harness their skills to avoid traps and poisonous snakes! Can you imagine placing a family heirloom, like a photo or painting into a chest that is unlockable for future generations only? Give us a chance to harness the ridiculously useless kleptomaniac trait, open locked treasures and steal them for yourself. Create yourself a pet cemetery where you can visit your ethereal loved ones!

\* Junkyard ‚Äì Why are spare parts so expensive? Give us a place to scavenge through other people‚Äôs junk for pete‚Äôs sake. I want to rummage through enormous dumpsters to find evidence (Detective career), old food and forgotten electronics and toys (let us repair broken junk and resell that repurposed junk on some kind of Sim eBay damnit), I want to see the new sentient robots lurking around the junkyard looking for replacement parts and engineers digging through mountains of useless electronics stealing the copper wiring. I want to see stray junkyard dogs and cats defending piles of rotten fish, the odd Vampire looking for discarded hospital blood bags, some homeless Sim wandering their trash paradise looking for morsels of scrumptious forgotten foodstuffs. Give us a new lot trait that means a junkyard generates more collectibles, a stall for people to sell their junk at that gives them future discounts on purchasable items, access to an exclusive online Sim club that mirrors ‚Äòtrash and treasure‚Äô so you can browse Bella Goth‚Äôs old, unwanted furniture. 

\* Energy Efficiency ‚Äì What is the precise function of a garbage bin? Why isn‚Äôt garbage more of a comical issue for Sims? Do you remember the trash piles and used pizza boxes in the Sims 1 that would take you hours to clean up? How about the recycle bin that was introduced? I want my pixelated people to have a conscious about environmental issues; I want to see environmentally driven Sims who can clean up trash piles in ANY neighbourhood, not just Sulani, I want a recycling system that gives my Sims access to reduced household bills, I want solar panels to place on rooves that reduce household electricity use, how about a water tank that Sims can access to water their harvestable gardens? Its 2020 Maxis, you need to get with the program and introduce some more energy efficient ways our Sims can contribute to their environment! I even suggest implementing a few devices Sims can exercise on to generate some power for a (Tesla-style) battery, let Sims see their daily/weekly/monthly water and power allowances, reward Sims who produce more power and feed it back to the grid and punish those who use power willy-nilly! Let celebrities and commoners alike join the fight for conservation, sustainability and environmentally friendly practices, throw protests and hold rallies, donate to charities for wind turbines and solar farms, heck, I could go on all day.

\* Transport ‚Äì So the bike thing is cute, LONG OVERDUE, but cute. But I expected more Maxis. If you‚Äôre going to divide up neighbourhoods for faster loading times and never give us cars, at least give my Sims some options to utilise different forms of transport within these tiny, secluded and unlively neighbourhoods, sheesh. I want to see a freakin‚Äô hoverboard, what good are engineers or scientists if they can‚Äôt make hoverboards? I want kids to ride scooters, those weird Segway things, WHERE DID THE PRAMS GO MAXIS?, and everyone to have access to skateboards, roller-skates, ice-skates and rollerblades. If you won‚Äôt let us ice-skate on the frozen ponds, rivers, bays, beaches and lakes (or swim, goddamn Maxis, get it together) then can you make some competitions for active Sims to participate in; like Figure Skating, Synchronised Swimming and Roller Derbies. It also might give us a reason to not feel weird that there is a male figure skating body suit in the athletics tab.

\* Newspaper ‚Äì Give it back! How are my Sims meant to keep up with the local gossip, or births, deaths and marriages? Show me when events are happening in the newspaper, like sales, retail discounts, restaurant coupons and pet adoption notices. 

\* Household Funds ‚Äì this isn‚Äôt a big ask, but why can‚Äôt I see an overview of my Sims funds? For any Sim autonomously earning money from fame, published books or harvestables ‚Äì why, oh why, can I not see an overview of household funds? I want to see the cost of living for my pixelated pal, I want to see where I can reduce costs, I want evidence that keeping a garden alive is actually worth the pain, show me how much my Sim earnt at work instead of the fleeting green indicator of Simoleons being absorbed into my depleted household funds. Why can‚Äôt I take out loans Maxis? You of all people should know, especially when your legion of dedicated fans takes out second house mortgages just to buy your overpriced, undeveloped, lack of content filled, nightmare games. Why can‚Äôt my Sim buy and rent houses and be given a detailed account of money made, or a stock exchange savvy Sim who can play the Sim share market, or even a freakin‚Äô account of how much money my Sim just lost wasting time on levelling up useless, boring and unwholesome skills. Give my kids a separate account or debit card so they can save up for a new laptop by selling their hideous drawings, potions and unwanted toys to Sims looking for these items online. How much rent do my roommates actually pay? Is their rent covering the household bills of them autonomously making the most expensive food in the fridge and breaking every electronic and/or plumbing?

\* University ‚Äì Who in their right mind decided to not allow Sims to cook on University housing lots? What greater purpose does this serve? Not only does the housing become PUTRID with rotting food and garbage that NPC university students REFUSE to clean up, Sims desperate to excel in Culinary Arts are meant to level their skills HOW? It‚Äôs not working, fix it! Give us back our stoves, damnit.

\* Ancestry ‚Äì here we go again with the whole ‚Äòwhy are you doing this in a game where the population ages‚Äô concept, you are punishing fans by not investing more into the ancestry system. Give Sims the ability to look at family histories, without having to have ever met them (read up on a grandfather who worked as Police Chief in the prime of his life, or find out where a long-lost relative is living in the city), give Sims the options to view the ancestry of other Sim families by subscribing to their website, or shop around for suitable genetics to repopulate with an online Sim sperm/egg bank. Why isn‚Äôt doing generation challenges challenging? All the fun of creating a successful lineage is crudely displayed with no extra information about Sims. 

\*Biographies ‚Äì LET US WRITE SIM BIOGRAPHIES. Make these viewable in the family history section, let us write them in create-a-sim, let us express our creative differences by adding weird and interesting biographies for townie and NPC Sims and for goodness sake, let us define family members or roommates by adding histories to our Sims households. 

\* Celebrity Family Members ‚Äì Why can‚Äôt my Sim properly introduce themselves to their famous family member? What horrible barrier have you created between the famous and common Sims? They have feelings you know, and they are sad that they have to ‚Äòattempt an introduction‚Äô to a visiting family member. Shame on you. 

\* Personality Traits ‚Äì Wow, just wow. The game is how old and we‚Äôve only been gifted a handful of new personality traits. Unless you mod the game there are no new, exciting or different personality traits available to players. Not only is there a serious lack of choice when it comes to picking traits, the existing traits themselves have the ability to add literally no depth to your character. Why is there a kleptomaniac trait when your Sim can‚Äôt needlessly steal anything and everything, pick people‚Äôs pockets or steal candy from children? The consequences for not indulging your personality traits are almost zero. You get a minor debuff that can be easily ignored. I want to go to gaol for being a kleptomaniac and picking pockets, I want to be invited to make my own cooking show as a foodie or be challenged to cooking feats of strength, I want my glutton Sim to possibly eat themselves to death and my good Sim have the ability to sign up to fight super crime.  

\* Character Values ‚Äì Could these values, once achieved, have a little more weight? Shouldn‚Äôt my good mannered Sim be praised by their principal and receive awards, can‚Äôt my empathetic Sim volunteer at a Vet Clinic? What if my irresponsible Sim could start bin fires? Why aren‚Äôt my argumentative Sims really good at debating? Also, at what point would conflict resolution be beneficial to Sims in the Sims 4 universe? There is no conflict. There are no autonomous break-ins, or street fights or babies that need rescuing from fires. It makes me sad how much this concept is used to influence your life as a child and teenager (not that we‚Äôd forget because it‚Äôs blasted in your face every few minutes because your kid can‚Äôt find their goddamn toys) and yet it has absolutely no impact or consequences when fulfilled or ignored. 

\* Aspirations ‚Äì Can we see the much needed refresh, overhaul and updating of the aspirations? Not only are they broken (you cannot complete certain aspirations on some Sims for some inexplicable reason), they are boring, they don‚Äôt empower the concepts your employing and there is little to no gratification at accomplishing aspirations except that you get to spend the rewards on old, outdated and unimaginative purchasable traits. Give us reward items, give us new traits and give us some depth!

\* Pets ‚Äì Why can‚Äôt I give my howling dog or cat a treat to shut them up when they‚Äôre on heat? The continuous, aggravating melody of your pet on heat is the reason I don‚Äôt own pets. Also, who adds occult themed concepts to their game and doesn‚Äôt give fans new varieties of pets? Where are my vampire bats who can be summoned at will to find you a new victim? Why can‚Äôt my alien Sims use telepathy on dogs and cats to make them more obedient? Who in their right mind releases a Witch themed expansion with no pet owls, toads or rats!? WHY?

\* Skill Challenges ‚Äì Do you remember having to visit all the bars in the world to learn new drink recipes? Do you remember cycling through how many specific fish you needed to acquire before becoming an angling expert? I‚Äôm not talking about ‚ÄòCollections‚Äô(a depressing experience in itself), I‚Äôm talking about writing ten mystery novels and becoming more adept at it, at running for 20 hours on a treadmill and being rewarded with becoming less sweaty and a whole plethora of Sims 3 skill challenge concepts. The skills in the Sims 4 are empty, even after reaching the pinnacle of your Sims skill i.e. photography, your Sim is still producing shitty quality versions and being punished for ever having levelled that skill in the first place. Maxis, this will not do. You need to diversify the skill lines, give Sims challenges to conquer and rewards to anticipate, new recipes to unlock, new socials and more skill-related Sim abilities. Reward them for being the top of their skill and stop making the journey to the top seem so useless and unrewarding.  

\* Health and Hygiene ‚Äì Goodness knows how my Sim contracted a cold in a pixelated world, but why can‚Äôt I visit the freakin‚Äô hospital? An immersive and fun concept, hospitals became a rabbit warren of long, terribly planned hallways, strange doctor/patient interactive behaviour and a living nightmare for anyone planning on climbing the career ladder when the PUDDLES WON‚ÄôT DISAPPEAR! I want my sick Sim to feel like I love them and want to care for their health and wellbeing, why do pets get all the love? Just because pets act like they‚Äôre semi-possessed and leaking fluids from every orifice, why aren‚Äôt sick Sims allowed to visit the people Vets? Do you want them to suffer Maxis?

\* Inventory ‚Äì you refuse to fix something that has been broken and almost unusable since launch. Not only do items glitch out so they can be neither sold or deleted (even if you place them in the world, they remain there, haunting your Sim forever), you will not show us the content of the stackable items and their quality meaning we have to sort through flowers, food, paintings, photos and more by placing them individually to see their quality. What the hell, Maxis? Why does my Sim need to stop what they are doing to open a goddamn box that contains something? I‚Äôm looking at you tiny Sim statues! 

\* Occult ‚Äì My Vampire Sim visited a lot recently and after drinking the blood of every Sim in sight, she went home ‚Äì only to be invaded by the people who now despised her and autonomously did jobs around my Sims home. Can you fix the damn doors? Can you fix the NPC and Townie interactions with Sims and their household lots so you don‚Äôt have randoms (only key holders) enter your actual house? No, I‚Äôm not locking the door for everyone because that in itself creates a wide variety of other problems. 

\* Clothes ‚Äì I‚Äôm not even going to get into the nightmare that is create-a-sim, but can I ask why teen to elder female Sims have one quarter of the amount of clothing options for winter as males do? Did you put them in a box somewhere in your attic next to your forgotten office Christmas decorations? Because they aren‚Äôt there. At all. You should get on that.  

\* Wasted Opportunities

A Criminal Career option that allows you to break into other Sim‚Äôs homes, a Doctor career option that lets you save someone‚Äôs life on the neighbourhood lot who is choking on another horrible gourmet fruitcake, or basically functional jobs and careers that provide extra incentive to get out in the world and interact with it. 

Makeup, Fashion and Tattoo parlours. Let me earn money by building a salon where Sims can pay to be made-up. Give new hairstyles, tattoos and makeup a bit more depth by adding buffs, career choices and traits (can you imagine a Fashion Victim Sim trait where they need to constantly buy new clothing, new hair and makeup otherwise their Sim eyeballs will fall out?). 

Neighbourhood Lot Seasonal Events. No, not the creatable kind, the change of season should bring people into your neighbourhood lot for a variety of reasons. Why aren‚Äôt the artistic Townie Sims setting up easels to paint on in Spring, or protestors randomly gathered in the street to promote climate change in Summer? Why not a parade for Harvestfest that passes down your street? Or people clearing the streets of snow? Bring back ice cream trucks and seasonal festival events at parks.",1578122906

thesims,2020,1,"Additionally, if you want to skip a game you may pick two from another. I‚Äôm trying to go off of base game features only, but I think it‚Äôs totally valid if there was something from a specific expansion pack that you think should be in a base game to include it! Hey, it‚Äôs your buildable base game, we‚Äôre all here just living in it ;)

OG Sims: ... honestly? This is why I included the skip hahaüòÇ it was amazing for the time, but as it is the first most key features of the base game are included in the others. I feel tempted to say robbers/the quirky NPC‚Äôs, but I‚Äôd rather be able to pick two features from another era instead.

Sims 2: this base game was absolutely insane. You got sooo much content right off the bat. I was stuck between two, the first being all the shopping options base game offers that really encourages you to get out of the house. However, I think if I could pick one thing from sims 2 base game to expand on/implement in a perfect base game, I think it would be their attraction system. I HATE that you can essentially make any 2 sims fall in love or even being friends with little to no trouble in the grand scheme of things. I really like having preferences that would make certain sims more appealing than others. This could also establish different sexualities more firmly, and in general make game play far more interesting. I think it‚Äôd be a lot more challenging and fun to play if my sims‚Äô romantic interactions could be rejected for reasons other than their relationship not being high enough.

Sims 3: the color wheel, however I personally don‚Äôt need it for every aspect of the game. I miss it for hair, and I wish we could have it for counters and couches so we could match the woods better (I‚Äôm reallyyyy picky about my woods matching). I think putting it in some areas and not others could help make the game more efficient, as the sims 4 runs infinitely smoother on my Mac than the sims 3 ever did on my family‚Äôs gaming PC. I‚Äôm going to also use my skip from OG Sims here, and say I really like the traits system of the Sims 3, I would just hope it is implemented more like the Sims 4. I think the Sims 4 traits actually make more difference in game play than they did in the Sims 3 (just my opinion! I‚Äôve heard other people say the opposite). I guess what I‚Äôm saying is I like the organization and options of the Sims 3 trait system, with the intensity of the Sims 4. 

Sims 4: I really actually like the semi-open world, but I do wish it was a bit more open. I personally don‚Äôt need a whole world to be open especially with how laggy that was at first. I wish that whatever area of town you are currently in is all completely open, though. Like if you‚Äôre at Britechester, I wish that there were no loading screens between the dorms and the commons, but don‚Äôt mind that there‚Äôs one between University of Britechester and Foxbury. I think having those be open with an occasional rabbit hole would make game play more fun, and I wouldn‚Äôt feel so stuck on my lot all the time.",1578169298

She was also a raging nympho, as in, would get a +6 Tense moodlet if she didn't have sex in a while.

So this raging rampant and heavily pregnant slut arrived to a party at the Von Haunt estate. She is insanely horny and flirty, so I decide to have a little romp just behind the dance floor. She begins flirting with the closest man and gets absolutely anally destroyed for about two seconds before a girl walks in and asks to join. Sure! The more the merrier!

So my Sim is in absolute heaven while other Sims look on, either scandalised or running off to the bathroom to masturbate (the Landgraabs begin to 69 each other within the estate). The threesome lasts a good while and my dazed Sim decides to have a drink. Unfortunately, the romp lasted for hours and did a toll on my poor Sim's bladder. She whines pathetically and pisses herself in front of the partygoers. Although she is mortified and smelly, she is still attractive enough for another Sim to proposition her.She gets rammed on the bench just as the party is dispersing at 6 am. 

More shots! The DJ left. More shots! Another DJ arrives at 9 and begins to play. My Sim is having the time of her life but is the only SIM on the lot. Unfortunately the drinks make her wasted, so she begins to pass out at random. After pissing herself one last time I decide to let her go home. She takes the LOOOONG way out while her energy is all but depleted. Then at the last leg of her way home, she decides it is too far and she needs to pass out.

Except.

She takes the LOOOONG way back to the DJ booth so she could fall asleep near a puddle of her own piss. At 6 pm the bar staff left, and that's when she decides to leave. 

She comes home and I tell her to take a quick shower, but she gets into labor before she does. Absolutely miserable at this point, I have her do cocaine to nullify the uncomfortable moodlets after the baby arrives. When she gives birth, she ends up overdosing on cocaine, cue cycle of complaining, pissing and passing out. Somehow, no idea how I managed that, I get her and her babies in a good enough mood and decide to reward momma with some sleep.

Except she isn't having it, because the nympho moodlet activated again and she will stop at nothing to get some more coked up party cock which will ultimately get her pregnant. 10/10 game.",1578194514

I know a lot of people say reboot or restart, but I‚Äôm on an Xbox one and it has happened at the same point with two different saves, I‚Äôm not sure if it was just because I cheated or an actual glitch?

1.) In The Beginning...

**Description**

Let there be Sim! You awaken to find yourself in the woods. You have no memory and little money. You start living off the land as best as you can while meeting a few interesting characters along the way though you mostly stick to yourself.At first you spend most of your time foraging, fishing and trying to  survive selling your herbal teas and foraged items. Eventually you are able to build yourself a nice little house and settle down for a bit. Your good friend the hermit eventually convinces you to start writing in hope that it will bring back memories of before you woke up in the woods. You find that you are a very good writer indeed and after a few years you have the money and the confidence to leave the woods and start exploring the world.

2.) Half Baked 

**Description**

Out in the real world at last! After having to garden and cook fresh food everyday while living in the woods you decide that the best way to make your way in the world would be to put those skills to good use and open up a bakery &amp; flower shop with money you had saved from your books sold. You focus the majority of your on your business and slowly grow it. You are getting better at socializing and coming out of your shell. Eventually baking is a small pond and you are growing into a pretty big fish. Time to upgrade from a small bakery to a prize winning restaurant. Can't be that hard right! This is also a time in your life when you start to notice something interesting and a bit terrifying. It's been a few decades since you first woke up without memory in the woods yet you don‚Äôt even look a day older. You are watching everyone around you get older, move on with their lives, even a few have died yet here you are the same as always. You wonder what this could mean for your future?

3.) Getting Real Learned

**Description**

Once it becomes glaringly obvious that for some unknown reason you seem to be immortal you are overcome with extreme unrest and anxiety. Where do we go from here? Are you stuck managing a restaurant while all of you friends die? No! You  have something they don't have. Infinite time. And you set yourself a goal to accomplish everything the world has to offer you. After all it seems you and the world are the only things that are going to be a constant together. You figure the best place to start learning as much as you can is University so off you go! You have no doubt that you will physically fit in since you haven't aged a bit but lets hope you are still ""hip""and ""with it"" to hang with the kids.

4.) Horse Doctors are Real Doctors Too

**Description**

Well it seems like you have learned everything that you can learn with a formal education so it's time to start putting all the knowledge in you noggin to good use. What to be, what to be. Well you like animals and you already have experience running a business sooo let's start off being a vet! You get to work setting up the best (and maybe only) veterinarian hospital in a small sleepy coastal town not far from where you went to college and train show dogs on the side. Work that audience fluffy! But then one fateful day someone said that performing heart surgery on a horse was less difficult than a human. The audacity! You'll show them! Time to switch gears and becoming a human doctor. Can't be that different right? So off you go into the ER, setting bones, running test and performing heart surgery (sometimes accidentally when you should be delivering a baby...) but just like everything else once you reach the top you start to feel that itch again. Plus it's about time for you to leave town before people notice you are seemingly immortal and start to ask questions. You take a moment to think about what you want to do next. Well you are really good at the technical side of medicine. Running test, doing research, that sort of thing. Hey! Maybe it's time to go from the practical side of medicine to the research side. Time to be a scientist!
 medicine to the research side. Time to be a scientist!

5.) Bill Nye the Science Guy

**Description**

Off to explore the endless possibilities of science! There seems to be an endless amount to learn and you are loving it. This will keep you occupied for a few decades at least. You focus on medical science for a few good years but one night you couldn't sleep so decided to take a late night walk through the desert in your backyard. The sky was ablaze with stars so bright they lit up the area like a nighttime sun. It was then that you decided to set your scientific sights on the cosmos. Over the next few years you create amazing technologies that allow you to explore more of the cosmos than anyone before but it's not enough for you. You are tired of just looking up at the sky, you need to be in it. You are easily able to get a job in aerospace with your skills and are soon off to the stars where you encounter untold adventure. And bring home a few mysterious creatures in the process. But time slowly passes on and you once again realize that it is time to move on.

6.) Hello Mr. Anderson

**Description**

You loved being an astronaut so much and are more than a little sad to see your time exploring the cosmos over but the astronaut community is small and you suspecting more than a few people were starting to get suspicious that you weren't aging. You know as a scientist that other scientists would love to get their hands on the cure to mortality and some would stop at nothing to do so. Time to lay low for awhile. You notice that a few tech companies are starting up in your area to you slowly slip away behind a computer. You still miss the days you use to tinker around with your rocket ships but can't have one of those in your backyard anymore without definitely bringing some attention to you. I mean it was weird enough that you had one in your backyard as an astronaut! In your spare time you tinker with your robotics skills that you picked up in college. Life was getting a little lonely while you were laying low as well so why not just build yourself a friend...yup jusssst friends.Your career slowly but naturally transitions to engineering and you are so glad to be back to working with your hands for a living and after some time passes you are able to stop laying low and live normally again. Everything is going so well for you! Your career is great, your friends are amazing and you are having the best time! .... And then you see him. A man in a black suit, black glasses in a black van. He follows you around for a few days. You begin to suspect that you cover has been blown and the science community has come to kidnap you and study your body in a lab for eternity. And then it happens, you get pushed into the van one night and driven away.

7.) I've Seen Stranger Things

**Description**

A few hours later the van stops. The door opens and military personnel take you out. You realize as you are being escorted into a building that you are on some sort of military base. Are they going to be doing military testing on you?! You are escorted into a room where you are told why you were taken. With a sigh of relief you find out that the military is only aware of your technical background yet nothing about your immortality. Apparently something very strange is going on in a town called... StrangeVille (shocking I know) and they need your help to try to figure out what is happening and sort it out. Easy you say! And get to work although things end up not being what they seem. You eventually solve the mystery and are hail a hero of the town. You have come to like the place after getting to know some locals so after a few more years in the military you decide to settle down for awhile and help out in the small town police department. You quickly move up in the police department since let's face it, you are like a million times more qualified than most of them. Heck most of your coworkers weren't even born when you were in college. Eventually you are tapped to become a secret agent and decide heck why not. However, one day you are approached by one of your higher ups and given an opportunity you couldn't pass up. It was to do something... well something technically evil... that's not you! Or is it? And what is evil anyways? You've been alive long enough to know that good vs. evil are just human constructs. Why shouldn't you get ahead? After all you have forever ahead of you. Why stop yourself from getting what you want when everyone else will die? You've helped enough people out. Now it's your turn to be a villain!

8.) Are we the Baddies?

**Description**

No more Mister Nice Guy! You decide that you no longer want to be told what to do by someone higher up. You want to be the Boss. So you get a gang of ragtag minor criminals together and start getting to work. And you are good at it. Really good. You feel more alive than you have in decades. Every heist makes you feel invincible. Who knew being bad could feel so good! You realize you are a master strategist and love sitting down for hours at a time plotting out the game plan for each new job. You decide the best way to hide your criminal activities is to set up a business front just so everything looks legit. You decide the best way to hide huge amounts of money flowing in and out is to make it look like you own an investment firm so that's what you set up. The thing is that no soon after setting up your fake investment firm you realize that you are making more money on the fake business than you were as a criminal. So I guess it looks like you are a legit business person now. You become a pillar of the community and people in your town start really looking up to you. When a local political seat opens up you decide on a whim to run for it and win! You spend the next few decades turning the economy around and building your small city up to something you can really be proud of. But tragedy strikes. Just when you had reached the top one of your old crime partners gets arrested for a petty crime and decides to spill the beans about you for a plea bargain. Time to skip town. Heck it's time to skip the country!

9.) Blowing Tombs Up Isn't Archaeology!

**Description**

Off to Selvadore you go to once again lay low. At first you miss home and find it hard to unwind and stop thinking about all the work you left behind. You‚Äôve been working one job or the other for decades now maybe even centuries. You lost track a long time ago. Thinking about it you fall into a small depression thinking about all the friends and maybe even lovers you‚Äôve had that are long dead now. What's the point of living when you just end up losing so much? No enough of that. This is why you work so hard. To keep your mind occupied and looking forward. But it's not like this small town nay village in the jungle has a booming economy you can just find yourself a job in. No, you will have to find your own hobby to keep you mind occupied. After talking to one of the workers at the local museum you decide to  try your hand at archaeology. You‚Äôve been doing technical work for so long that you forgot how much you enjoyed your art and history classes back in your long gone college days. So you buy everything you will need for a long archaeology expedition and off you go. For years you fully immerse yourself in the Selvadorardian culture. Befriending the locals, learning their customs and culture. You end up being the go-to expert on the lost Omiscan Artifacts even going back to you writing days and writing a few respected history textbooks on the subject. You almost feel like you could live her forever but the reality of the matter is that as much as you were loved by the Selvadorian you knew that they were a superstitious culture and would most likely not take kindly once they found out that you were immortal. So with a heavy heart you pack up your things, say goodbye and head to the city.

10.) F.R.I.E.N.D.S.

**Description**

You decide that after so much time in a small village that moving to the big city would be a refreshing change and what city is being and more vibrant than San Myshuno! You realize quickly that the best way to fit in is to join the young adult scene full of bright young people moving to the city after college to find their destiny. You chose a small but quaint fixer upper apartment and get a job at a restaurant as a bartender. You end up falling in with a lovely little friend group which soon becomes like family to you. Nothing brings people closer than being alone in a big city and relying on their friends for fun, reassurance and advice. You spend the vast majority of your time hanging out, exploring the city and singing karaoke.In your free time you have converted a small space in your apartment into a painting studio. You are reconnecting with your artistic and are loving it. Eventually you get so good that you are making enough money to quit your job as a bartender and start painting full time! You even get a small following and the art museum asks you to be a part of one of their joint artist exhibitions. While you are at the exhibition you start talking about your thoughts on the other painting with the art director. By the end of the night you are shocked when the director asks if you want a job as an art critic which you gladly accept. You are once again amazed by how lucky you are. For the first time you feel like you actually have a family. You are surrounded by friends, art, food and it feels like the fun will never end. Until one night it does change and not only are you forced to leave everything behind once again but everything you thought you knew about the world after living for so long is turned on its head.

11.) Better Love Story than Twilight

**Description**

As you were walking home from a late night at a local art gallery exhibition you hear what sounds like wings flapping by your head. You turn quickly but there is nothing there. You still feel something within you that is uneasy, an unknown fear. You begin to walk more briskly but the fear is growing. You burst into a run and then a full on sprint. And that's when you feel it. Someone grabs you faster than should be possible from behind and you feel a sting on your neck. As you slowly sink to the ground and begin to lose consciousness you get a look at your attacker. Their mouth is stained red with your blood and their eyes are dead black. You wake up slumped against a wall in a dark alley not far from where you were attacked. It is still dark out and you find a note it your lap. Its say that for some reason they have decided to spare you but to get inside before the morning. There are further instructions to make your way to a town called Forgotten Hollow if you want to protect the people you love. And so the next night you leave a note for your friends and head off. In Forgotten Hollow you learn what has happened. You have been turned into a vampire and will soon begin to change and feed on the living. Your whole world is turned upside down. On the upside you are finally surrounded by the first people in the world to know what it is like to be immortal. You meet people that are even older than you are and can talk openly about everything you have been through which becomes a weight takes so much weight off your shoulders. However there is a downside. You are no longer human and you feel so much uncontrolled anger inside of you. To get it under control you turn to music. But even that only plugs the hole up temporarily. Over time you become a more and more powerful vampire but you feel hollow inside and that's when it hits you. What you miss so much was having a family like you felt when living in San Myshuno. And so you get to biting. Growing your own vampire family. And again for awhile you feel whole. But one day you find in a dusty tome something thought lost, something all vampires thought was a myth but desperately wanted. The recipe for the cure to vampirism. Bottoms up baby! Time to get my tan back!

thesims,2020,1,"Thanks to the Vinesauce [Meme House](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/MemeHouse) streams, I was inspired to become a Sims player. Since [Johnny Zest](https://sims.fandom.com/wiki/Johnny_Zest) doesn't exist in The Sims 3, I decided to [recreate him](https://i.imgur.com/qdeqC6h.png) to the best of my ability and give him a happy (hopefully) life. His default lifetime wish was International Super Spy, which I thought was too funny to change, so he got a job in law enforcement. Reading from the career choices that developing a relationship with your work partner is important, and since at the time I had no idea how to find/greet other Sims, Johnny became fast friends with fellow officer Felipe Marshall, a fairy. He was married already, but despite having the Good trait Johnny didn't mind, and they soon became best friends--but not before Johnny was [attacked](https://i.imgur.com/VFDdJjG.png) by [zombies](https://i.imgur.com/BGYJYcr.png), including one named Sage.

After a few in-game weeks, I made another Sim, a fairy with the Evil trait named [Cuddles Chokehold](https://i.imgur.com/H1DYYDi.png). She wanted to be a famous fortuneteller and became BFFs with a number of coworkers, including Sage, the zombie that attacked Johnny the other day, and...[Kim Marshall](https://i.imgur.com/Iqm5PzJ.png), Felipe's wife. Johnny and Kim were only acquaintances, but he'd learned enough to know that she was also Evil, while Felipe was Good. When Sage got married to one of Cuddles' friends, Li Lo, Cuddles was too happy at their happiness to break them up... so she decided to flirt with Kim instead. Cuddles and Kim were already very friendly so their romance developed quickly, and Johnny and Felipe's relationship blossomed into romance.

I had gotten better at playing the game by this point, so I took Johnny and Felipe out on their first date to the Spring Love Festival. We encountered [a clone of Cuddles](https://i.imgur.com/8s5Cx8A.png) working the kissing booth, but more importantly, Johnny and Felipe had their [first kiss](https://i.imgur.com/fe6XuVc.png)...which Kim saw. An argument ensued, but luckily Johnny's comedic skills saved the day and he and Kim somehow stayed friends. That night, Johnny got an emergency call to work...so Cuddles invited Kim over and they shared THEIR first kiss. They became a couple just as Johnny got home.

Then Johnny got abducted by aliens and became pregnant. Suffering from unexpected weight gain, he asked Felipe out on a date, and after a long, romantic night they became a couple as well. And then the full moon rose, and Felipe [became a zombie](https://i.imgur.com/5b3pgBm.png) (and so did the Cuddles clone). The date ended there, but Johnny was emboldened and asked him out the following day with intent to propose. I had Cuddles invite Kim to the same place with the same idea, completely forgetting the complicated dynamics I'd accidentally set up (My thought process was 'I need to keep track of my Sims, let's go to the same spot!'). Just as Johnny proposed to Felipe, Cuddles and Kim showed up. An argument between Kim and Johnny ensued, while Felipe made [a hilarious face](https://i.imgur.com/GPOkjji.png) as Cuddles and Kim made out. 

To make matters worse, the alien baby [was born](https://i.imgur.com/obenquQ.png). After some debate it was immediately sent back to its homeworld, cause really, things were a complete trainwreck by this point. Luckily, Kim perked up when Cuddles proposed to her too, and she accepted. Not wanting to waste any time, both couples had private weddings ASAP and moved into Johnny and Cuddles' house for convenience, taking along 3 pets Kim and Felipe hadn't told anyone about. The [household](https://i.imgur.com/WeuExN5.png) now consists of Johnny x Felipe and Cuddles x Kim plus the Marshalls' 2 dogs and 1 horse, and that was about where I left off for the night.

- Sim with Excitable trait always looks like they are grumpy mood - constantly making grumpy sounds to themselves etc.

- Sim with Brave trait behave scared when swimming in pool. Doesn't have trait ""Fear of water""

- Flirty sim was really hard to persuade on basic romantic actions. After proposed to marry I managed to exchange rings only after about week or so.

- Sim with ""Dislikes outdoor"" behaved more enthusiastic and friendly on open community lots while at home he acted like he had no mood for joint activities.

Ever since I downloaded the new patch, there‚Äôs been these annoying fast forward functions that happen around the middle of the simday. It‚Äôs usually when the needs are somewhat good and there are several sims at work/school. Basically, the game will continuously unpause itself even after I try pausing it, and will use the fast forward function.

However, it‚Äôs become not only an annoyance, but gamebreaking. I tried to get my sim to go somewhere with her new puppy during the day (she goes to work in the late afternoon, whereas the teens come home from school in the late afternoon) but the fast forwarding glitch happened right as they were about to go somewhere. This left an indefinite loading screen and I had to use control panel to exit the game without saving.

I think in the past I had option in Nraas SP mod that prevented sims from that, but it was only available if Nraas Story progression mode is on. I turned it off now because it's too random and laggy in the perspective. Couldn't find any mods that would fix my issue with books.

thesims,2020,1,"This is in the context of the Murphy Bed from Tiny Living Stuff, but it applies to several hundred features from other packs people complain about.

This is easily my least favorite criticism this community lobs out there.

Here's the thing: 99% of features? ""Could have"" been in literally any other pack. You can equate most content to most packs.

 A murphy bed is appropriate for University for small dorms. It is appropriate for City Living for small apartments. It is appropriate for Outdoor Retreat for use in cabins. It is appropriate for Vampires (they could use it in the wall as a coffin). It was appropriate for Get Famous as it matches the mid-century furniture. It is appropriate for Parenthood as a space-saving furniture piece. It is appropriate for Jungle Adventure as a rental house piece (small 1 room rental with folding bed). It is appropriate for Luxury party Stuff as its original purpose as designed by an opera singer in california was to convert a bedroom into a parlor for hosting guests. It is appropriate for Kids Room Stuff as a neat bed for kids. It is appropriate for Bowling Night Stuff as it suits the mid-century aesthetic. 

But you know what? **It wasn't in those packs, and it never will be,** so claiming it ""could have been in them"" is completely pointless. The devs cannot go back in time and decide to put it in them. They're done.

The simple fact is, when making those packs, a Murphy Bed didn't come up- Or maybe it did! It totally might have! But they may have chosen to opt to work on other more relevant or desirable features for those packs, and save it for later.

If they planned to make a pack for tiny living- **Which they did, possibly years in advance**, because that's how these things work (see the stuff pack votes as examples for how the process works and how long it takes)- they surely would've wanted to save the Murphy bed as one of its key features, and thus obviously would've held off on it. Plus packs have budgets- budgets for everything. Art, programming, new features, etc. They can't just do everything because ""it'd make sense"", that's not how it works. 

 A murphy bed is an entirely new type of item with an entirely new set of animations and functionality. University had a budget for how many of those types of items they were going to put into it and the ones they chose to put made more sense overall for University versus this pack (which was assuredly in development at the same time or arund the same time), meaning they planned features for different packs accordingly. 

""It could/should have been in [other pack]"" is just the worst criticism, it brings nothing to the table. It brings no discussion, it's just a blanket ""I am not satisfied and there is no means to satisfy me"" statement, which is worthless both to the community and the devs. There is nothing anyone can do with this information, and I don't believe it's a fair issue to take anyway. 

I'm not saying you seem distraught or angry over it personally, I just hate this criticism and that's how it tends to go- angry people being angry that a feature won't magically be inserted into the past, upset with something coming out *now* because they've decided that the 30 cents worth of value it adds to a new stuff pack would've been better suited to being 15 cents of value in some prior expansion pack, and somehow their life is in turmoil over this detail. It's dumb, and I hate it, and I'm rambling.

Either way, it exists NOW- and if it's literally so important to someone's game, it costs 10 bucks to get it, plus a bunch of other items, and that's a fair value. 10 bucks is one and a half drinks at starbucks. Are you gonna play a family using a murphy bed for long enough time that the gameplay value is worth more to you than one and a half drinks at starbucks? Probably. So who cares? Get it and use it in *all* those contexts I listed (except vampires) *now*, it'll still be cool even if it came later.",1578417145

thesims,2020,1,"So, out of the blue we were surprised with a new SP. And first I want to say that I like it. It seems really cool and well done. Finally we get an SP that gives us usable objects, something that we can use with every theme. But, I have two issues.

First, I really hope that they will somewhat upgrade the way the game calculates paths for Sims. We all know that it's not bad, but once you clutter the house, out stuff close to each other, the Sims go crazy and suddenly can't find proper paths. Especially with some random bugs where there is obvious open path and the Sims complain that they can't move. Also when they put down something on the floor, like a book, and then block themselves. So, I hope that they will give this a patch and fix before SP.

The second issue is... Why the hell wasn't this a part of City Living? Many apartments are small and this kind of stuff would be perfect. I didn't pay close attention, but I didn't see bunk beds? Sorry if they are there, and I hope they do make them. But all of these objects that fit the theme of tiny living could've been made for the City Living pack. I'm kind of tired of this crap that they do. They have made so many packs that could have been made into one, because there themes are so close to each other. Like you could fit the whole supernatural genre in one pack. It now just becomes obvious that they are pulling out wallets and grabbing the money.

TL;DR - I like Tiny Living and I am excited, but I hope that they patch and upgrade Sims finding paths and I'm sick of them making so many similar packs that could've been made into one.",1578424268

I've been searching the web about save file sizes and found a couple pretty old answers and one new but none actually helped me a lot so here goes my questions:
* How big is your save file size?
Mine it's currently 11 mb and it keeps growing like crazy. I'm on 2* gen.

* Did someone tested after putting a gallery build and save it how big was the change in size?
I remember once I filled my world for 3 hours with gallery builds I loved and after I finished imagine my shock my save file size was like 20 mb without even playing yet. So I deleted it and never did it again.

""What is the problem"", you may say, ""it's just a file size"". Well, I honestly don't know how to answer that, I don't have a great computer and my options are limited but I do have every pack/dlc and if my save file suddenly goes crazy and start lagging after just a couple of in game weeks playing... my progress would be all lost and I'll have to start over and over again so I want to know how big is other players save file size so I would be more relaxed when I'm playing and not freak out at the size.

I'm embarrassed to admit that I'm kinda obsessed with this ""issue"" after I play and go to see how much it grow. So some input would be lovely! üòä",1578439878

For computers and laptops, it might be better to head over to a sub that specializes in those recommendations, such as /r/SuggestALaptop, /r/buildapc, or /r/buildapcforme.  You can still ask here, they are just \*way\* better equipped to answer those questions. However, we recognise that these subs may be overwhelming or difficult to navigate for those who don't know much about computers. We are always looking for more accessible guides to help you guys out. One of our community members, /u/iOui has done just that, and created some Sims specific youtube guides to help with purchasing your next computer so you can enjoy The Sims. You can go check out her videos here: [http://youtube.com/OuiSims](http://youtube.com/OuiSims)

Another option is to plug your PC specs over at \[Can You RUN it\] ([https://www.systemrequirementslab.com/cyri](https://www.systemrequirementslab.com/cyri)) or \[PC Gaming Benchmark\]([https://www.pcgamebenchmark.com/](https://www.pcgamebenchmark.com/)) or just search ""will my PC run it"" in Google for other options.

thesims,2021,1,"Whenever I play Sims 2 or Sims 3 I always find myself creating stories or at least having a vague outline of who my characters are, their personalities, conflicts, where they came from and where they're going etc. I'm not very big on storytelling, it just happens naturally. You have your lifetime wish and it's the cornerstone of your character building and their final destination, everything in between is up to you. It's kind of a gamble in TS2 but most of the time I can work with what I get just fine, and if not then I set my own goal and nothing distracts me from it.

However in Sims 4 despite my very much deliberate efforts to have a consistent character I find myself juggling the aspirations and my character just does whatever will earn her more reward points. There is a bunch of short simple goals that'll yeild the sweet points and it kills the RP. You can be a curator when you're collecting, a public enemy when you're fighting, an archeologist when you're on vacation and so on. Of course you can not do it but it's far more rewarding and time-efficient to do. I personally feel punished when the game tells me that I have to do 5 jobs for scoundrels all over again cause I forgot to switch the damn thing. And now that I mention scoundrels, storied packs don't much help with the lack of roleplay, in fact they're counter-immersive cause once you've completed them they're dead.",1609555544

 i need help with making my sims 4 game run smoothly. to start off, i have 16 gbs of ram, a nvidia 2060 super gpu, and an intel i7 processor. my sims 4 game is fairly laggy and i only have 1.49 gb of mods; which is barely anything imo. other games such as cyberpunk 2077 run extremely well on my computer so i believe ts4 should not be running this slowly. does anyone know how to fix the lag? i've seen people with significantly worse specs run the game 10x smoother than me. i clear out my localthumb cache, screenshots, and even use razer cortex to clear up ram when im playing the game. all of my mods are fully updated and so is my game. it's really frustrating how poorly it runs. pls help me! &lt;3",1609561503

I have tried opening sims from origin and through the shortcut on my desktop but it just sends me back to origin (origin thinks that I am playing the game).
Google has been useless so far as most solutions require me to move my sims 4 folder out which doesnt exist yet as the game has never opened. I have tried:
- repairing the game
- uninstalling and reinstalling both origin and sims. -Changing the sims from 64 bit to 32 bit.
-Rebooting my pc
-Changing where sims is stored on my computer
-loading the game without origin in game 
-updating my game

thesims,2021,1,"I went back to TS3 and now I'm remembering one of the things I hated about it: story progression.

I want to have a rotational play but I can't: I play with family A and then family B has a new baby, someone left or whatever. Then I remember I had NRAAS installed but now I'm trying it and... I don't like it either.

Let's say I have family A (man, woman, teen, child) and family B (vampire and vampire daughter).

Well, now then due to NRAAS I was playing with family B for two sim days and when I looked at my family A my teen who is still a teen has a degree in arts? and 6 traits instead of 4? what? I could fix his traits and he has 4 again but I can't remove his degree... so I'll just try to imagine he is extra smart or something...

I've been reading this: [https://www.nraas.net/community/Story-Progression-Rotational-Caste-Settings](https://www.nraas.net/community/Story-Progression-Rotational-Caste-Settings)But I have two problems: 1. My mod is in Spanish (which I don't know if I chose this in the past or what) and 2. Some of the options there aren't in my game and it makes it more confusing.

Anyway, I don't want random things happening in my game. I just want some way to play with family A without messing with family B and viceversa. I only want them to age but nothing else. So... is there any mod or way to do it?

Edit: And now for some reason my sims won't age...

* Playing my fave little family: Husband, wife (pregnant), toddler, dog
* Parents haven't been on a date in a while -- they hire a nanny, go have dinner.
* Restaurant is fun but both parents get exhausted to near-collapse, so we go home.
* Nanny has left the kitchen counter dirty, several half-eaten plates of food, and a cutting board from an abandoned cuisine project, but that's a problem for Morning Parents. Toddler's needs are pretty good; he goes to sleep, parents go to sleep.
* 3:30am, toddler's super hungry and mad about it. Dad wakes up, struggles to get kid into highchair because kid keeps trying to ""Ask for Food"" instead of being picked up to go eat the food that's already waiting. Meanwhile, Mom's bladder is tanking so I wake her up and send her to bathroom.
* Mom breaks toilet and then dirties bathroom sink, promptly goes into labor.
* We call the nanny again. Toddler is begging to roughhouse, dog is whining to go for a walk. Dad is, of course, dancing around in a panic. Mom keeps attempting to get yoghurt out of the fridge.
* Nanny arrives so we ""Have Baby at Hospital"". Fast forward, pause for name-the-baby prompt, I take a few moments happily deciding on a name for their daughter, hit submit.

#**Bi-Weekly Build Challenge, Week 105: Mid-Century Modern Mansions!**

Picture a long, low-slung home with floor-to-ceiling windows, exposed beams and an open floor plan... That description fits a fair number of prairie, ranch, and mid-century modern style homes, which sometimes causes confusion, because mid-century modern is not actually a style: It‚Äôs a collection that broadly describes architecture, furniture, and graphic design from the middle of the 20th century, roughly 1940 to 1975. What these types of homes share is ‚Äúan emphasis on lifestyle, a new way of modern living centered around family and home‚Äù. Mid-century modern homes were inspired by high-style prairie architecture, which emphasized how people lived while melding buildings with their environment. Frank Lloyd Wright, the father of the prairie style, said that in modern U.S. architecture, form no longer followed function: *Form was function*. Mid-century modern encompasses three well-known styles ‚Äî international, contemporary and organic. Build the mid-century modern mansion of your dreams and bring the outside in!


&gt;Key Elements:

&gt;* Simple, clean look, inside and outside. Lots of windows.

&gt;* Flat, contemporary roofing.

thesims,2021,1,"Here‚Äôs mine down below:

Sims 1: Magic Town. No explanation needed

Sims 2: I think most will pick Pleasantview, but I think Strangetown is my favorite. Something about it is very charming and it‚Äôs packed with very interesting sims. The lore that came with spin-off Sims games also makes it a really interesting town.

Sims 3: The sims 3 came with a crap tone of amazing worlds. I have to say Twinbrook is probably my favorite. I just really like the vibe of the town. For store worlds, I‚Äôd probably say Sunlit Tides or Aurora Skies.

Sims 4: Windenburg is my favorite because of how much space you get and I like all of the townies. Theirs a lot do in windenburg compared to other worlds",1609685772
thesims,2021,1,"Can they be replaced with builds off the gallery? Or do they have some game play element attached to them that I'll miss out if I take builds off the gallery? 

EA builds are so bland and dull, which often leads me to replacing them with builds off the gallery. I brought Eco Lifestyle recently and I'm tempted to replace the community spaces building but when I try there's this pop up asking me to specify the community space into a marketplace, maker space or community garden.

Sorry if this is repeated elsewhere, but my 7-year old has become interested in Sims games based on a Youtube Kids channel she watches sometimes.  I remember the Sims from ages ago (not sure how old I was - but had to be really early).  I tried looking at the iOS version of the Sims but it is rated 12+.  Are there better options for her out there (preferably iPad or PC)?

She is quite intrigued about building characters, building a house, etc.  I remember being older than  her in my younger years and enjoying things like Sim City but feel that might be a little too hard right now.

Again - hope you don't mind me asking - would love to find something for her :).

Sorry for the long-winded starting paragraph thingy, I just want to make sure I'm not accidentally putting the name of the mod in the title or preview text. If you can still see it please let me know and I'll put more text in this bit so people won't accidentally see the mod name. This is just a really, really, really word-vomity version of a censor bar. Thank you for reading. I should also add I'm not just doing this to evade a filter or anything (for mod consideration) just to make sure the NSFW is squirreled away so the people who'd rather not see it won't accidentally see it.

Anyway - basemental and wicked whims make the selection of sites I can upload these stories to very small. The drug references actually get it banned from discord, technically, because whilst they're fake drugs the description and mention of drugs (i think some actually reference drugs that exist IRL, and they're not the actual drugs sure but discord might not know the distinction), this it's a topic that could get you in trouble on discord. there might be a relevant reddit, but i'm not sure if any are suitable right now.

And of course since wicked whims is very adult in ways I probably shouldn't be going in depth in, that limits where you can post screenies/share stories about it. I know of one discord server which I'm already in (initials DS, not sure if i'm allowed to post links or anything like that so I'm gonna stay clear) however the server is too big to just have somewhere to post. Tumblr bans NSFW, but if there was a site like that where I could put all of my posts and people could read it that's the sort of place I'm looking for.

DeviantART is out of the question because the site is kind of garbage but also there are rules against WW stuff and posting sims screenshots in general (copyright &amp; ownership reasons; unless you make the CC yourself i think it's banned). I'm not actually sure about archive of your own, but I think that's more for /lit/ lit, as opposed to talking about your playthroughs of the game; the NSFW and illegal stuff (by which I mean the drugs from basemental) would be allowed, and screenshots might be, but I think you'd need to do full write-ups for it to be accepted as opposed to casual things.

Then there's a family only door leading to an almost 100% open concept living area. (Only the bedrooms and bathrooms are separate rooms.)

Even on the lowest of potato settings it still does this thing where everything stops for a few seconds, like I can look around and some animations will play but I can't select anything and my sims will just stop doing stuff.

After a while it comes back, but then it freezes again.

The only thing I can think of that would cause this would be from me downloading GTA V, but I don't know how that would effect the sims at all.

Here's a couple examples of the tones I'm referring to, from presets because for some reason you can still have these tones from presets but you can't select them.

Does anyone know a way to re-add the old skintone lineup to the game? I haven't seen anyone else have this problem and can't find anything by looking it up. (If the skin update had KEPT the old tones and just added more I wouldn't be so fussed about it but for some reason they decided no one needed those anymore...)

thesims,2021,1,"So. I've been thinking (a dangerous thing to do in my case, honestly). It all started when I realized that Journey to Batuu where I live is actually more expensive than the rest of the game packs, costing an unholy amount of money for basically things that should have been a stuff pack.

Well, then I asked myself: are there packs that I would pay more to have?

Don't get me wrong, the pricing of the packs are so absurd that I only have the basegame, but I was wondering. And I realized The Sims 4 could have had some GREAT packs while keeping the same concepts they went for in the last 6 years. I'm gonna brainstorm here.

Alternative Lifestyle (Expansion Pack) - Eco Lifestyle, Tiny Living, and Nifty Knitting

Seasons (Expansion Pack) - Seasons, Snowy Escape, Island Living and Spooky Stuff (ps: not because I don't think these couldn't have come apart, but I think that it would be cool to see a pack with a wintery wonderland and a summer paradise with seasons)

Night Life (Expansion Pack)  - City Living, Get Together, Dine Out, Spa Day, Movie Hangout Stuff, Bowling Stuff and Fitness Stuff (now THAT is a decent size expansion, with the same themes)

Family (Game Pack) - Parenthood, Kids Room Stuff, Toddler Room Stuff, Backyard Stuff, Laundry Day

Pets (Expansion Pack) - Cats and Dogs,  My First Pet Stuff

Adulthood (Expansion Pack) - Get to Work and Discovery University (again not that these packs couldn't have come apart, but it would make a decent size expansion, one that would deserve a higher price than usual)

Travel! (Game Pack) - Outdoor Retreat and Jungle Adventure

Supernatural (Expansion Pack) - Vampires, Realm of Magic, Strangerville and Journey to Batuu (in this case what I thought was that it would be awesome if the mother plant in Strangerville was actually endangering Batuu and you would have to unite different factions to defeat the plant, like THAT WOULD BE SOOOO COOOL but it's not what we got :( )

Get Famous (Expansion Pack) - Get Famous, Vintage Glamour, Luxury Party, Perfect Patio, Cool Kitchen and Moschino Stuff

Now, I don't know if I got all of the packs, but this is my brainstorm basically. What I'm saying is that most of the packs that flopped (such as Batwho-asked-for-this) wouldn't have flopped so hard if there was MORE included in them.

This is just my rant. Do you agree with me? What packs do you think should have come together? And if you disagree, I'm very interested in hearing your thoughts on the matter :)

She and my sim disliked each other and yet he *still* got an annoying sad moodlet for it??

Are there any good mods that tweak death reactions to make them more realistic for sims who had a neutral or negative relationship to the sim who died? Tried googling but most of what I found were mods that just did stuff like add funerals and extra steps to do when a sim dies. I've already got some gameplay mods that are worsening this situation since some of them (like roBurky's meaningful stories) make emotions less fleeting and more impactful...which is usually great but in this specific situation it's annoying. I get it's probably at least a little traumatizing to watch someone keel over before your eyes regardless of relationship but they shouldn't be depressed for days because of it and I just want it to ennnnd.

thesims,2021,1,"I decided to start the 100 Baby Challenge in Dec of 2018.   While I was into it for awhile, I stopped for a good 9-10 months after my computer died and I thought I lost it all.   After getting some computer advice I fixed it and got my saved game! Over the holidays I finished it off and completed my wall of baby daddy selfies and birth certificates.   Here is a picture of all the baby daddies.  Right now I am making a 'museum' to display everything in the game for the family to visit.  Was a fun challenge for sure!

She's on team ""the small packs make sense because it's a small team"", which in itself is fair enough but that doesn't excuse the lack of gameplay, especially considering the amount of money people spend on it, in my opinion.I'd love to hear what you all think, do you play with mods in the sims 3/4 and why/why not?

ps. with mods I really mean gameplay mods, so not NRAAS/MCCC, custom content etc.

And I have way more problems with the way townies look in general. not just clothing.

First of all, why the darkest skin tone with the brightest shade of hair? Now I know that [people have pulled this off in real life](https://www.essence.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/1524081093/DE81FCF3-7D27-4000-9084-0077B6357FC0.jpeg), and I would pretend it's dyed, But the eyebrows are blonde too usually, and for dark skinned people, it's usually not the natural hair color.

And another thing, most townies tend to have the coolest skin tone with blonde hair, they look like a [zombie vampire with jaundice](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/754076292982374400/796773755833024522/01-03-21_6-47-32_PM.png) from the deepest depths of the dollar store clearance section.

Note: I did try following the modding guide at the official forums, but when attempting to assign the bow to a vertex group, nothing shows up. So I need someone who can tell me what I did wrong so I can fix it and not make the same mistake with other stuff. Maybe even have someone look over the file and tell me how to fix it.

thesims,2021,1,"Basically:

**The Problem**

Sims 4's emotions feel shallow and useless; don't last, do not have deeper meaning, overtrump each other illogically, and are not very realistic or intuitive. A Sim who just lost their spouse but got a nice room suddenly is 100% happy and very one-dimensional.

Sims 3's moodlets have meaning and are multilayered, as they are very specific about what caused them and they always overlap; but they only have two modes: positive and negative. That makes them have barely any impact on the actions the Sim takes except for the result of the positive/negative moodlet math.

**The Proposal**

Sims 3 style moodlets, that are *not only* positive or negative, but instead have emotional types similar to Sims 4.

The *more* moodlets of a certain emotion are active and the stronger they are, the higher the chance is you have a contextual emotional action available with something concerning the moodlet. That makes it possible to be sad and happy at the same time, relating to the content of what happened.

**Example:**

Bill's wife Martha died; but Bill is at a hilarious and well decorated comedy club and just had a great meal. When Bill talks about his wife, he gets sad. He can ""reminisce"" at a picture of his wife. He can ""brood about death"" in the mirror. But he can also ""talk about hilarious jokes"" to other people as he also has a happy mood.

But it was contextual that Bill could do these actions.

If he instead was happy for reasons to do with his wife, and sad for other reasons, he could have different available actions altogether fitting the context.

thesims,2021,1,"Hey, Simmers. I'm curious if anyone knows what hidden factors influence the likelihood of vampire attacks? I've owned the Vampires pack for over a year now, and have gotten exactly three vampire attacks after hundreds of hours of gameplay. Other people, I've heard, get attacked dozens and dozens of times. I'd like play a vampire hunter at least once, so I was hoping to figure out what these players were doing to get attacked so much.

I know from aliens that there's a hidden counter influencing how likely your Sim is to get abducted. If you interact with aliens, use the telescope, use the rocket ship, have space rocks or artifacts on your lot, use the satellite to contact aliens, or are in the scientist career you boost your chances of abduction. If your Sim doesn't do/have any of these then you have barely any chance of abduction. My Sims have done all of these, to the point where they were getting abducted waaay too much. 

For Vampires I've noticed that the only worlds I get attacked in are City Living's Myshuno and in the Vampires' Forgotten Hollow. I think this means that either particular worlds have a higher attack chance, or there has to be a vampire loaded on the lot for it to trigger (and vampires wander both worlds after dark.)

What have you noticed?

UPDATE with things noticed:

* Attacks happen in San Myshuno, Forgotten Hollow, Windenberg

* Having a vampire living or active in a world or neighborhood might increase attack chances 

* Associating with vampires might increase attack chances, however if you are friends with a vampire that particular vampire will not attack you 

* Vampire lore might increase attack chances, but too high vampire lore might also prevent attacks (needs feedback) 

* Growing garlic on a lot might increase attack chances - however, too much garlic *near* a vampire will prevent them from being able to bite

* The Vampire Nexus lot trait does not appear to increase attack chances, but does trigger friendly nighttime visits by vampires. This might be a bug.

* Households with at least one vampire in them cannot get attacked, even if there are also human or alien Sims living in the household

Edit: for those of you who are experiencing the bug where vampire invasions are non-existent, Tumblr user lotharihoe has a few bugfixes available, as part of their Bug Fixes Compilation and also a Sim Spawn Overhaul. Both mods have a five day cooldown for vampire visits once you are attacked, though.",1610058646

So I decided to treat myself recently to the new snowy escape dlc for sims 4 and as soon as I downloaded it and tried to run the game it did this thing, where the game goes to a white screen and remains unresponsive in task manager no matter how long I waited. So far I've tried repairing the game through origin, reinstalling the game and origin, running the game and origin in compatibility mode, launching the game with snowy escape disabled, then all other dlc disabled still nothing. Then I tried reinstalling my graphics drivers thinking that it was an issue with that but still nothing. I'm honestly at my wits end here and I have no clue what to do from here because its been a while since I've been able to play at all.

here's my rig in case knowing what I've got helps...

Radeon RX580 (4GB)

ASUS prime z390-a motherboard

UPDATE: turns out it ended up being nzxt cam causing the issues with it and a coupe other games behaving weirdly.

She's a jelly bean ghost, and I noticed something odd - the animation cycle on her ""skin"" or whatever, where it cycles through shades of purple, looks like a slideshow. It progresses at like, a frame every five seconds. It's terrible! The jelly bean particles are missing completely, too. I opened her up in CAS to look at the other ghost types, and they all seem like this; any particle effects, like the smoke on fire ghosts, the drips of drowned ghosts, and the little sprites of haunting curse ghosts, are completely absent, and any animation cycles, like the electrical crackling of electrocution ghosts and the flowing water of scuba drowned ghosts, are *super* slow.

I know this is maybe a niche problem, but since I play with ghosts a lot, it's driving me nuts.

Because I was tired I tried to launch my game and the error message said that a cc (simdadating by littlemssams) was broken. The problem was that I already deleted this cc. I searched both manually and automatically the cc and like I expected, no cc in my mod folder or in any of sims 4 folder.

I decided to put my cc one by one manually and started with one named bree hair, it's a simple cc hair which normally wouldn't break the game. Guess what? Game can't launch. I tried with removing the hair and put a medical accessory cc and still the error message.

Background: The last time I played The Sims was around 15 years ago (Sims 2 with some expansion packs to be exact). My 11-12 year old self was obsessed and would spend hours into the early morning playing. I don't know why I stopped playing exactly, but I haven't really thought about The Sims again until now. I've been browsing this forum and am amazed at how far the game (seemingly) has come with 3 and 4. I feel archaic because I can't even understand most of the terms used here to describe the game. 

I just bought a [new laptop](https://www.bestbuy.com/site/dell-inspiron-13-7000-2-in-1-13-3-4k-ultra-hd-touch-screen-laptop-intel-core-i7-16gb-memory-512gb-ssd-32gb-optane-black/6409063.p?skuId=6409063#tab=buyingOptions?bof=openbox) for every day use, but now have the extreme urge to play the Sims again. I checked and should have the minimum requirements to play either 3 or 4 (base games at least). 

I have read countless posts on this forum and cannot decide if I should:
1. Go old school and download 2 for the nostalgia 
2. Go with 3 for the gameplay 
3. Go with 4 for the build mode  

I remember really loving building houses when I played the sims 2, so I am leaning towards 4 even if the gameplay isn't as great as 3, but I'm so torn given how much people seem to hate 4. I'd love any opinions, recommendations on where to buy/download, and the best expansion/stuff packs/mods to download without dropping a ton of money. Thanks in advance!

Edit: WOW, thank you all so much for the input and perspective! What a nice welcome back into the Sims community. I've decided to start with Sims 4 and see how I feel. I can guarantee I will love it, just because I'm SO excited to get back into playing. Thank you again!",1610078651

So, obviously The Sims was always a non zero sum game, there were no clear winners or losers, even if you purposely killed off your entire family or got fired, had a mental breakdown etc. Back at it's core, not regarding the intricate details and how the Sims actually reacted to their life situations and their memories and all those things that we always mention missing, it's non zero sum game, right? It's endless possibilities, many forum posts, video series, online communities that let their imagination run wild whilst creating these stories *and* sharing them either in virtual space or with their families, friends in real life.






Something that I've read, coming from EA, that kind of put a ? above my head was this competition part that they keep mentioning? I've never felt that in this community and please do correct me if I'm wrong here. But they mentioned it in a way of like players 'competing' who has a better, more beautiful, detailed house etc etc... But I've never felt that to be competition. It's more of like 'Hey guys, look at what I made!' type of thing. And this is *exactly* what he mentioned in one of his conference type presentations, the feeling of pride and accomplishment that sparked from the player that linear media didn't offer you (books, movies and so on). The whole idea of a virtual space or rather multiple virtual spaces where players share houses, designs, stories even custom content and mods is sort of like an intertwined world that we created amongst ourselves and explored a different depth of our imagination by these rather simple inputs!





So therefore, no it is not a competition type thing, it's immersing in a world we love and enjoy and share with each other. 
That's why, with many, many other reasons, EA is failing to give us the experience we love in TS2 and TS1. It's interpreting the game in a way it's not designed to be interpreted.





Sorry for the long post, it's not anything revolutionary by any means, just a different take upon many why the TS4 lacks in giving us experience.",1610114129

I've gotta ask, what is the issue with the content they're giving? How is it different from expansions before? I realize there are DIFFERENT features, but stuff like platforms and the customizable stairs stuff didn't exist before to my knowledge. Is this just a recency bias vs. nostalgia thing?

thesims,2021,1,"This is actually a rant, but I also would like to know about your opinion on this:

I keep seeing people saying EA has finally fixed the skintones and I agree that darker skintones look so much richer and vibrant and there's so many different tones... All my black sims look absolutely beautiful.

But there's a downside: I've lately found myself investing over fifteen minutes (!!) every time I create a light-skinned sim because all the light skintones look like occult's skintones. They are either freezed-to-death blue, alien purple, dead-fish yellow or demon red. It's been months since the update and I only have two light skintones saved that I actually like, they are the only ones I use now for light-skinned sims because they are the least weird, but I'm not thrilled about them either.

I find the new tool kind of user-unfriendly, the colours don't follow any logical order. You click on one and it's light, the next one is dark and then the next one is light again. Not even the undertones are in order, it's so confusing. I just don't feel like creating sims anymore, it's getting really frustrating and it ruins the whole CAS experience to me. It's not like this didn't happen before, there were only a couple skintones that I liked before the update and I mostly used CC skintones instead, but since now there are so many options it has become overwhelming. It's not only choosing a skin, it's also trying every single slider... I just don't have the patience, and I shouldn't be expected to either.

I believe the problem is that the old skins were created from light skintones and then they made them darker to create dark skintones, that's why they looked so bad. But now I feel like they've done the opposite: they've created beautiful black skintones and made them lighter to create the white ones, but that's not how human skin works.

I'm thinking about deleting most of EA skintones and just using CC instead. Has anyone done this? Does any of you feel the same way as I do?

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: changed ""coloured"" for ""black"" as I was told it is inappropriate. English is my third language and even though I can write and speak it well, there's some terms that we are not taught in class, so I appreciate that you correct me so that I don't make the same mistake again.

Am I doing something wrong? How am I supposed to get food without a fridge yet? My sim hated the fruitcakes my neighbours brought me and threw it all out.

I tried google, but all results are about running retail stores, not shopping at them.",1610193895

(RTX 2060 Super and ryzen 5 3600x ) But still somehow the game still completely crushes my setup without even trying ! This darn Game runs so Bad (i even set my RAM limit higher up!

Lucky for us (at least in Sunset Valley) There is Sunset  Valley: 2013! 

First time I saw this I was blown away, I wish the Sims team could do something like this. Every  like 5 years do an update to the game thats optional that just updates it, gives hims maybe new clothes and hair, changes there houses. Make it feel like times changed.

Anyway, here is a link to a youtube video. and obviously the link for the world download is there as well. I know its french but there are ways to get english version of the world if you just look

Here‚Äôs some of my favorite mods that will completely change the way you play The Sims 4. I also thought it would be nice to give some tips and tricks I've figured out, so that you don't have to waste time discovering them for yourself. :)

**First off**: Please watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HMjOkb6jd0) to see how to place mods into your game. Keep in mind that many files will come in zipped folders. Unless the site from where you installed it says otherwise, you'll always want to extract them into your `Mods` folder. And PLEASE, whenever you install a new mod, make sure to triple check that everything you want is only one folder deep in your `Mods` folder. Often, a mod will extract as, say, `Mods/Faster_Time/Faster_Time/fasterTime.package`. Make sure to cut and paste everything into that first folder under `Mods` (`Mods/Faster_Time/fasterTime.package`). Also, at the end of this post, I have a tip for downloading mods into an external drive.

Okay, enough with the preamble! Let‚Äôs dive into it:

Here‚Äôs two **MUST HAVE mods** ‚Äì these are absolute game changers ‚Äì once you try them, you‚Äôll never want to go back! Make sure you read everything on their installation pages, because they change just about everything in the game (for the better!):

* [Slice of Life](https://www.kawaiistaciemods.com/post/slice-of-life-mod) ‚Äì Breathe some life into your creations! With SOL, your sims ‚Äì and NPCs! ‚Äì can do anything and everything. Sims are considerably more independent, and their moods affect their autonomous actions. Have a flirty sim? She might just make out with her girlfriend, out of the blue. Did someone recently die in your family? Your sim will likely receive a text from a close friend, offering him condolences. Or maybe an NPC friend has some leftover cookies ‚Äì they just might call you over to help them gobble them up! Teens and adults can get acne, kids can lose teeth, women can have periods (can be removed), everyone can order sickness medication, mothers can have babies in the hospital‚Ä¶ Shall I continue? This mod has it all. You will never get bored of The Sims again. ([Here's a great video](https://youtu.be/-OUmD89HRus) if you want to get hyped up!)
* [MC Command Center (MCCC)](https://deaderpool-mccc.com/#/releases) ‚Äì Did you know that The Sims was created to serve as an adult dollhouse? With all the ways that The Sims 4 restricts you, it sometimes doesn‚Äôt feel that way. MCCC, however, allows you to access new game controls quickly and (relatively) easily. There is SO much more to this mod than I could even begin to explain. Instead, I suggest that you glance over [this page](https://deaderpool-mccc.com/#/doc/overview) and watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gE0219u-cgc). It‚Äôs a bit hard to get used to, but I promise that it‚Äôs worth the effort. 
   * PLEASE NOTE: You will want to install both the latest releases of MC Command Center AND MC Woohoo.

Here‚Äôs some other mods that I love to the moon and back:

* [Memorable Events](https://www.kawaiistaciemods.com/post/memorable-events-mod) ‚Äì Before installing this, I thought The Sims had more than enough Social Event options. I was wrong! Memorable Events will add 40 unique Special Events to your game; some of my favorites being Family Gathering, Meet my Partner, Study Session, and Day of Grieving.
* [The Life Decider](https://www.kawaiistaciemods.com/post/the-life-decider)‚Äì This mod is absolutely genius. I can't stand it when my sim meets the NPC of their dreams...only to find that they have 0 skills, a strange assortment of traits, and no career to speak of. With The Life Decider mod, you can change that with the press of a button! Simply click on a sim to see the ""Decide \_\_\_'s life"" button and change a bland townie to a fascinating character.
* [Explore Mod](https://www.kawaiistaciemods.com/post/the-explore-mod)‚Äì Is your sim looking for excitement? With this mod, you can send them off for an afternoon of exploration. They can go alone or with friends, and they will come back with new buffs and bigger smiles.
* [ATM Cards](https://littlemssam.tumblr.com/post/175407172343/atm-cards-and-now-with-real-credit-function) ‚Äì Now your sims can be as in debt as you are! Take out a credit card and get some loans going. Earlier today, one of my sims took out a  *¬ß* 5,000 loan to buy the house of her dreams. She's been paying it back incrementally, but she's on her way to being both debt-free and living in paradise.
* [113 More Jobs](https://www.patreon.com/posts/26446835)‚Äì Sounds intimidating, I know! But don't worry, you can pick and choose which ones you want. You can either install each individually or give the modder (MidniteTech) $2 on Patreon to install all of them at once. Personally, I installed all at once, and then went through and deleted the ones I didn't want (as well as the ones that I can't play - for example, I don't have the Cats &amp; Dogs pack, so my sims can't be Dog Walkers).
* [WickedWhims](https://wickedwhimsmod.com/download)or [WonderfulWhims](https://wonderfulwhims.com/)‚Äì the X-rated and PG-13-rated (in that order) mods for MUCH better love and sex (ahem, WooHoo!) in The Sims 4. With one of these mods, your sims can have much more realistic relationships, allowing for a very immersive experience. Most modders would actually say that these belong in the ""must-haves"" category. **Keep in mind:** You can only have ONE of these installed at a time, and you need to either remove the menstrual cycle aspect from your Whims mod or your Slice of Life mod (depending on which one you like more, if you even want periods in your game in the first place).
   * Here's a [WickedWhims overview video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mADETx_nZag) (Remember - it's REALLY NSFW!) and a [WonderfulWhims overview video.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIzvp8wOYoA)
* [Functional Cotton Candy Machine](https://modthesims.info/d/604589/cotton-candy-machine-updated-20th-june-2020.html) ‚Äì Honestly, what more do I need to say? It's so cute, too!

&amp;#x200B;

I'd also like to give you a tip for further modding. Sometimes, you'll have files that end with `.7zip`. For these, you're going to want to install [this program.](https://www.7-zip.org/download.html) To use it, right click on any `.7zip` file, select ""Open With..."", ""Choose another app"" (even if 7Zip shows up in the little menu), THEN select ""7Zip"". Now, you'll want to click the checkbox for ""Always use this app to open .7zip files"", and hit ""OK"".

Also, here's a HUGE tip for anyone playing on a computer with an external or D:// drive! Technically, your `Mods` folder needs to go under `C:\Users\...\ Documents\Electronic Arts\The Sims 4`. However, I figured out a trick to make the mods really save on your other drive. 

1. Create a folder in your other drive called ‚ÄúMods‚Äù (capital M!). Copy the address by clicking in the circled part shown in the picture below:

 

https://preview.redd.it/6sak9ilk6ca61.png?width=586&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7304a3c8997e9704db76d5c7415c3042be47cc8d

2. Go to your `C:\Users\...\ Documents\Electronic Arts\The Sims 4` folder.

3. Right click in empty space in the folder, click ‚ÄúNew‚Äù, and select ‚ÄúCreate Shortcut‚Äù. 

4. Paste in what you copied earlier and hit ‚ÄúNext‚Äù.

5. Click ‚ÄúFinish‚Äù.

Now your mods are saved elsewhere, but can still be accessed by the game in your C:// drive. I currently have almost 7 GB of mods, so it‚Äôs a good thing I can save them on my D:// drive, with its terabyte of space!

&amp;#x200B;

SO in theory, if enough gens following the Hybrid married/got snatched by full-blooded Aliens, wouldn't it be possible to get at least ONE spawn who had powers despite having some Sim blood in them?

Sorry, if it doesn't show the cursor and the sound isn't working in the video for some reason. I don't know why that's happening because my game had a cursor and the sound was working.. Weird recording mode.. Even though in the game my cursor was visible I couldn't click on ANYTHING and everything just stopped rendering.

I remember being able to keep it together for the most part, but I just recently installed it again (thanks to a member of the community linking me a download of the complete collection) and holy shit. I don‚Äôt know how I did it 20 years ago??? The needs drop like fucking stones off a cliff. If you don‚Äôt play with cheats, you have to work a ton of shitty jobs out of the newspaper until you find one you like, and there‚Äôs only one offer a day. Then you won‚Äôt get promoted unless you‚Äôre halfway happy before leaving the house but the Sims are almost always miserable. Their social need is the hardest one for me. I tried to make a 1 sim household but my girl was constantly bawling over how fucking lonely she is. So then I remade a house with two women so they could talk to each other. But then they act catty and pick fights all the time and shitty interactions drop the social bar anyway. Almost ALL the sims in town are super unfriendly and rude, I tried calling Mortimer and Bella over the phone and they basically told me to screw off even after they‚Äôd come over and had dinner with me the night before. Advancing relationships is so difficult. I wanted to make my sims lesbians but they won‚Äôt even hug. That fucking doomsday raccoon always comes and fucks up my shit. The plants are always dying.

thesims,2022,1,"I still have. A part of community (who prefer supernatural gameplay rather than realism) really loved fairies from 3, and we have seen vampires are greatly enchanted in sims 4. To be honest, cottage living sounds excellent for fairy lifestate but it might be a neglected feature rather than fleshed out occult. I think fairies (and werewolves) need proper gamepacks focused on themselves only, same as vampires. 

What I expect from fairies gamepack? Well;

- Fairies need a special world, like Magic Realm, Sixam or sth. Lets call it ""Arcadia"". In order to access this area, sim should do something special. Ie, in order to go Sixam, you should access max level space rocket skill, build rocket. Arcadia should be similar; maybe gardening skill, carrying excellent quality artwork, having particular reward trait, completing spesific aspiration or sth like that should be required to travel this fairy world. Other than that, randomly generated fairy NPCs should be hidden and only can be exposed via asking, similar to aliens and mermaids. Realm aestethic can be similar to Silvian Glade. I mean, even Silvian Glade can be reworked as secret fairy realm. 
- Fairies should have skill chain; like vampires. Sims 4 have proper alignment system and it can be used to enchant fairy mechanics aswell. Unseelie/Seelie thing can be translated as Evil/Good thing. Ie, evil fairies can do special magic and good fairies can do others. Similar to sims 2 witches. 

I didnt think too much about werewolves but they need proper skill chain aswell. Maybe enchanted social interaction with animals? I dont know, Im not so much familiar with werewolf lore anyway

#**Bi-Weekly Build Challenge, Week 117: Around the World; Tudor Homes!** 

Tudor homes look like something straight out of a fairytale, with a charming style that takes its cues from medieval English architecture. Their distinctive wood-faced facades and white stuccoed walls were popular with well-to-do homeowners from the the mid-19th century until WWII. Tudor homes are characterized by their steeply pitched gable roofs, playfully elaborate masonry chimneys, embellished doorways, groupings of windows, and decorative timbering. Unlike the centuries-old homes they used for inspiration, Tudor homes are built with brick, not wood, and often have exposed-brick siding on their first floor. On the upper floors, the large sections of the siding are covered in white stucco, which is then accented with large, dark timber beams to create the illusion that the house is built on a wooden frame.  Inside, Tudor houses continue their historically-inspired motif with walls covered in a veneer of plaster and ornate, detailed wooden elements like wainscoting and trim. Like the exterior, Tudor ceilings are accented with dark, heavy wooden beams that run across a white plaster finish.

Residential &amp; vacation properties ONLY. Must be fully functional. (TIP: Consider using cheats to unlock debug/hidden items and to place objects more freely!)

***NOTE: Challenges are open for TWO weeks!***

thesims,2022,1,"I recently got a new computer and I have The Sims 2, The Sims 3 and The Sims 4.

I decided I wanted to install The Sims 3 first. I only got the base game when it first came out and I never bought any of the expansion packs. I was in senior year of high school so I was a little interested in this version but life happened and I stopped playing The Sims 3 and dived right into The Sims 4.

There's like 12 expansion packs!

&amp;#x200B;

Well, I didn't realize how many expansion packs there was and so I decided to get the Generations, World Adventures, and Late Night expansion packs and I FORGOT about the open world concept and no loading screens. The open world feature made me fall in love with The Sims 3 again and I love the ease of going to the Map View screen and then click on my Sim whereever they are and it's so easy. I love watching my Sim drive their car or bicycle or walk wherever and follow them. I am so sad that The Sims 4 does not have this feature. It just makes the gameplay smoother and enjoyable.

&amp;#x200B;

The second thing I forgot about was the color wheel! I loved rediscovering that you can create literally anything and create your own style and colors or patterns, not only with your Sims clothing/accessories but also the house! It made me re-inspired again but the only thing I noticed was as I was trying to build my house with using that color wheel tool, the game kept freezing on me and took forever to load, I don't know what that's all about but I am hoping to continue with the color wheel.

&amp;#x200B;

I am enjoying the new expansions so far. I've dabbled into the World Adventures one and it was cool going on vacation to Egypt and I liked the Adventures quests and having your Sim go on these quests and doing the puzzles and I am glad they have prompts to help you along with the quests so it's not too difficult. I like that you can call long distance and create friends from these faraway countries and build long distance relationships! 

&amp;#x200B;

I plan on playing The Sims 3 for awhile before I install the Sims 4 again. I got really bored with The Sims 4. So I am happy to play The Sims 3 and create new houses and stories and have fun again!!

&amp;#x200B;

Looking forward to buying the other expansion packs for The Sims 3",1641146861

So since I had already saved this sim to the bin I decided to go to edit town and create a new household with just him and then merged him with the household I am playing with.

thesims,2022,1,"I‚Äôve complained before about how my sims never die of anything but old age so I downloaded a few mods to add some more drama. Life Tragedies killed off my legacy heir, Ada, with a fatal illness a little while ago.

Ada was a Paranormal Investigator  who lived in a haunted house. She brought Guidry back to life and they had three kids together before she died. The eldest child, Mary, was one I had a real soft spot for. She was super smart and pretty and helped her widowed dad raise her younger siblings while doing amazingly at school and having some good friends and a blossoming teenage romance. She was awesome.

I forgot that the mod I downloaded makes fire spread super quickly and gives sims less time to extinguish themselves before they burn to death. Some evil spectres set my girl Mary on fire, and despite Guidry trying to put her out, she died. Even worse, the fire spread at an astronomical rate and took out Guidry too. I got the Game Over screen for the first time ever.

The youngest kids were at school at the time and were suddenly orphaned and sent to live with an aunt they barely know when they got back (ie I rescued them from the household bin and moved them in with Aunt Florence so I can continue my legacy).

It‚Äôs just now as a type this out that I realise I‚Äôve accidentally recreated A Series of Unfortunate Events in my game. I wanted drama and I guess I got it!

When I first played this in 2002-2003, I remember distinctly being able to build houses on lots without moving Sims onto them. Was this never a thing in TS1, or was it added in with a later expansion pack? 

I downloaded both the Sims 1.1.5 update as well as the Livin Large 1.2.2 update from Macintosh Repository, but I can't get either of them to install. Neither says that the file is valid for updating. How do I update this game? Do the expansions take care of that? I know I'm still using 1.1 because of the Rosebud cheat.

thesims,2022,1,"I had about 7 of The Sims 3 games on Origin, as well as nearly the entire collection of The Sims 4. All was well until The Sims 3 launcher stopped responding. I did some research for a couple of days, keeping cool all the while figuring eventually I would fix it. There are a ton of suggestions for this problem, but none work. At the end of the day, it seemed the only thing I didn't try was uninstalled Windows in general. At the end of my rope, I contacted EA Origin support through their call center. To summarize, they told me to try the things I've already tried, and then simply suggested to wait it out, that it'll be fixed eventually on their end (implying it was a client problem, but to begin with this guy seemed to think it wasn't until the last moment). 

Three weeks passed. I still can't launch The Sims 3. I cut my losses and uninstall Origin (I don't play The Sims 4 or The Sims 2 all that much anymore, both of which were on that account) and I notice The Sims 3 are on Winter Holiday sale on Steam. Insanity is (insert quote here) but I was curious. Would the launcher work on Steam? In the worst-case scenario, it doesn't and I'll just submit a refund ticket. I went ahead and bought the entire collection for $81. 

It worked like a charm. No problems whatsoever. That was less than a week ago and I'm relieved to have my beloved TS3 back. I doubt I'll reinstall Origin any time soon, and I know I won't buy from them again just in case their launcher mysteriously stops working. 

Other than to vent, I'm curious if anyone savvier than me has any idea what went on here and why suddenly Origin bucked up so badly for me when it came to The Sims 3? Keep in my I tried many fixes including just reinstalling the game fresh, and even Origin itself (the latter a few times). Did anyone else here have a similar issue to mine, and how/when was it resolved?

If they couldn't make The Sims 4 great from the start, what makes anyone think they won't do the _exact_ same thing with the next game? I am not as mad as everyone else is about the game BUT, because I know everyone else is, how can we trust them to do right by the sequel if they can't do right by this one? It makes literally no sense to me to move on when they haven't even earned our trust with this one. That's like saying we can trust the human race to move to Mars and not trash the planet (haven't we been doing that to the Earth?). 

Before they show us The Sims 5, I think it's only fair to let them prove they are trustworthy. Honestly, to anyone who is tired of The Sims 4, just stop playing it. Stop buying packs and kits. Avoid news on it (as much as you can) and just wait for the next game to come out (which requires occasional returning to seeing news but that might be upsetting so...). I'm sorry, people have spent literally hundreds of dollars and other currency _just_ to have it thrown in their face with a brand new sequel that might turn out just like the game that came before it. 

I know it's been a long time, that's a fair and valid point, but it'd be foolish for The Sims 5 to release before they even polish The Sims 4. Because, and here is the kicker, what if NONE of the items on this list comes to fruition whatsoever and then the next game comes out looking like The Sims 4 launch (assuming everyone is in agreement with this list, of course)? Are you telling me y'all wouldn't be pissed off? I would be. 

And, again, I am not even as bothered by all of this as everyone else (I'd be mad on behalf); The Sims 4 is my favorite game in the franchise - I don't really have any attachment or desire to play the others, and I've played The Sims 2 and The Sims 3: Pets on console so I say that in earnest. 

So yeah, I want this game to be the damn best it can be before I can feel relieved and satisfied enough to move on. Otherwise, it won't feel right to me. I legitimately am afraid for the next game. 

I apologize if this comes off as rude or angry, I honestly didn't know I felt this way until now. I mean absolutely no ill-will to anyone, I am merely giving my thoughts here, that is all. Obviously my feelings do not pertain to everyone and they also do not invalidate what anyone feels. I just wanted to get that off my chest, I hope you all understand.",1641388141
thesims,2022,1,"So I just aged up baby boy twins to toddlers. Now I wasn't surprised one has pointy ears, as the son of Caleb, and the other a normal looking toddler, son of Jade.  What I am confused about is the size difference between the toddlers. Vampire toddler is a chunker. Normal toddler is a bean pole. Both Caleb and Jade are on the fit side of things. Did my vampire toddler just get hungry more often? Or suck out all the vampire tiddy milk and left none for the normal baby???? Is this just a random roll as to when they age up? Because I fed them both when they were crying for food. Did Caleb sneak in some bottle when I wasn't looking?

thesims,2022,1,"Gameplay kit that involves water heaters for the first time in the main series.

Two new functional objects: tank water heater and tankless water heater.

Placing a water heater will activate the new gameplay mechanic. Also it can be deactivated in Packs Options.

Water heaters will add a new item in the lot bill: water heating. Depending of which heater is placed, the cost will be higher or lower. The tank water heater will be expensive than the tankless one, but the cost of heating will be lower.

Water heaters will impact the use plumbing items only in residential lots.

Each heater will have some options to upgrades, that will impact in the diary use of those items:

* **Water pressure valve:** to avoid some problems like change of water temperature when a Sim is taking a shower and another Sim flushes the toilet.
* **Thermostat:** to have access to new types of showers/baths along with the current ones like brisk or steamy.
* **Auto temperature:** chooses the right temperature automaticaly (Seasons only)
* **Better gas valve:** reduces the consume of gas (Eco Lifestyle only for tankless heater)
* **Solar powered:** reduces the cost of water heating (Eco Lifestyle only for tank heater)

Several new moodlets will be added as well, mostly will trigger while taking a shower, a bath or using a plumbing item but also for flushing the toilet while another sim is taking a shower/bath (depeding of the trait) and washing the dishes with the right temperature.

Packs compatibility:

* For Seasons owners, water heaters will have an extra upgrade to regulate the water temperature depending of the season.
* For Eco Lifestyle owners, the tank water heater will contribuite to keep the Eco Footprint of the neighborhood in contrast with the tankless one that will increase the Industrial Footprint. Also for Eco Lifestyle owners, having several solar panels in the lot will reduce the cost of water heating in the lot bill for the tank water heater.
* If Laundry Day is installed, washing machine use while another Sim is taking a shower or a bath will impact.
* If Cats &amp; Dogs is installed, pet baths (and also toddlers) will be the same temperature with or without a water heater.
* Water heating gameplay will be deactivated for apartments (City Living and Eco Lifestyle).

Finally, along with the water heaters, five new objects, decorative only, will be released with this kit:

* Propane tank
* Water meter
* Gas meter
* Fuse box
* Roof vent",1641393176

thesims,2022,1,"The Sims team has talked about redoing the lore for older premades and I‚Äôve been thinking about what I would like to see them do with them and I thought of two things they could do with the Goths to make them unique to sims 4 while also maintaining elements from their sims 2 and 3 selves. The first concept is what I would like to see most, but won‚Äôt because it requires Get To Work: Have the playable Bella Goth not be the real Bella. This is partially inspired by sims 2 strangetown. A big piece of the lore is that the aliens were infatuated with Bella because she was the ‚Äúperfect‚Äù human, being part of the power couple of Pleasantview while also having the perfect body and looks. So I would have the story be to abduct Bella for themselves, but rather than leaving the Goths empty handed like they did in the sims 2, they do an exchange: They take the real Bella but give them back an alien Bella‚Äî Aliens in the sims 4 have the ability to disguise themselves as humans and alter their disguise, so they could have fake Bella be a disguised alien that tries to pass herself off as the real Bella, a secret she tries to keep from her family (who may be implied to have suspicions that she isn‚Äôt who she seems). A base game friendly version would be to have the story as Bella was cloned by aliens but the real Bella died in an accident. They bring back cloned Bella but she has no relationship with her family members and doesn‚Äôt appear in their family trees. The story could be centered on whether the Goth family can return to the status quo or if this shatters the family dynamic. Just an idea I had.",1641410930

thesims,2022,1,"Not here to defend sims 4, it is a disappointment. 

It‚Äôs my least favorite out the franchise- We already know that, the modding community and the dedicated sims 4 player base  been carrying it this whole time and they absolutely deserve better. 
So hey, it won‚Äôt hurt to talk about anything else but how shit 4 is, 

What I like about sims 4, 
-in-depth CAS 
-queer friendly content and ability to create trans sims without having to alter the games coding 
-San Myshuno
- having a whole empty neighborhood  to yourself to build from scratch (Newcrest) 
-easier to run
-involved parenting system introduced via that parenthood explanation pack 
-albeit a lil ashy, I like the wide variety of skin tones you can choose (breadcrumbs energy right here) 

What I didn‚Äôt like about the previous games, 

Sims 1: (I‚Äôm not gonna judge it too harshly it‚Äôs 20+ yrs old) 
-only two life stages, child and adult- you cannot age up the former without magic or cheats I think. 
-HARD AF, your motives deteriorate fast, leveling up your skills takes a lot of time, and cause your sim‚Äôs motives are all low they will refuse to do anything but watch tv and eat, making money is even harder. 

Sims 2: 
-game corruption is a massive issue with sims 2, 
it can happen if you‚Äôre spending 
too much time at strange town (where a lot of early development took place, thus older data that wasn‚Äôt disposed of properly absolutely fucks up your game), resurrecting a pre-made ancestor (a lot of them got data and assets that were cut eventually), resurrecting a sim with a deleted gravestone (don‚Äôt delete gravestones) if you got child ghosts on your lot, strange town Bella Goth introducing you to corrupt sims, etc.. yeah a lot of people tend to forget how messy sims 2 can be if you‚Äôre not careful 
-limited wardrobe options in CAS, to this day I still wonder why they bothered to add the top and bottom clothing options as they‚Äôre quite limited compared to the full outfit option.
-to include gay marriage in your game you had to resort to mods (sims 2 was made at a time where gay marriage was a pipe dream) and as for transgender sims‚Ä¶ well it‚Äôs possible if you‚Äôre ready to mess around with the sim‚Äôs coding using SimPe

Sims 3:
-ugly 
-bland cookie-cutter soundtrack
-Even on the best computers, it still ran like crap if you installed it with a pack or two 
-when you switch to career attire the game changes your hair style and takes off your shoes (this happens if you use hairstyles and clothing from recent packs) 
-the sims store shoved down our throats from the main menu to the buy/build mode trying to sell you mediocre add-ons",1641513526

But what's something you've almost never seen anyone ask for that you would want?

I'll start: pool maintenance. 

It drives me wild that they can just add a pool anywhere, no matter the climate, and it just maintains itself year round. 

You never have to skim? Vacuum? Clean the filters? Check the pH? Add chlorine? You don't ever winterize? Y'all, if they were actually leaving those pools open during the winter their pipes would be wrecked. If they were heating them 1. they shouldn't die of cold when swimming and 2. their bills should be *astronomical*. If they AREN'T heating them then why haven't they drained and covered them!

Plus I want to be able to hire a cabana boy to manage it all if my sims don't feel like doing it themselves. 

I'd love a Pools stuff pack that adds in the drudgery of pool maintenance in an entertaining way. No more magical self-cleaning self-maintaining pools.

thesims,2022,1,"I've recently been trying to get back into the Sims 4 after a couple years of not touching it, and it blows me away just how unresponsive sims are in this game. I queue up a few tasks for one of my sims, switch over to another for a little bit, and by the time I switch back over to the first sim they've already forgotten about everything I told them to do and are instead queuing up actions that are taking a higher priority than my own actions. I've even seen actions that I've queued up immediately swap themselves around in a sim's queue for absolutely no reason. Oh, you want me to use the bathroom, eat some cereal, and then take the dog for a walk in that order? Well I'm gonna take the dog for a walk first and let my bladder fail while doing so, just cuz. Like... bruh. 

Don't even get me started on toddlers. The household I'm currently playing just had twins, and the amount of times I've tried getting a sim to do something only for my control to be ripped from me by one of the toddlers' needs getting a little low makes me wanna screech. What's that? A toddler's hunger need is below 50%? Time to spam the ""check toddler"" interaction! What's that? A toddler's social need isn't capped out at 100%? Time to spam the ""watch TV with"" interaction! Any interaction initiated by a toddler takes precedent over my own commands, so I'm constantly having to babysit my sims with queued actions and cancel the toddler ones until they finish what I told them to do.

There's even a delay in issuing and cancelling commands. I tell a sim ""go here"" and it won't actually pop up in their queue until a few seconds afterwards. I cancel an action in a sim's queue and it feels like a century goes by before the game registers my input and removes the action. I've never experienced this in the previous games, even when it's bogged down with mods. I can fill up a sim's queue with things to do in TS3 for instance and not have to worry about some random nonsense forcing it's way into the queue unless it was something serious, like the sim's bladder failing or a meteor about to fall on them.

The level of unnecessary micromanagement in the Sims 4 is just wow. wow wow wow. I really want to like this game, and there are some aspects of it that I do genuinely enjoy, but sometimes it feels like EA just doesn't want me to like it :')",1641688310

EDIT: Sorry, my fault! I'm talking about Sims 4 here, thanks!


The title sort of explains it. (I've also posted this in a different subreddit, apologies if you see it twice.)

I'm looking but can't quite find a mod I'm looking for. Sure, there's a popular ""change name and/or gender"" mod, but that requires using CTRL+SHIFT+C and entering a command, which is... jarring.

I would like to inquire if anyone has found a more ""realistic"" mod. Even just a sort of ""leave for a few hours into a rabbithole and come back"" sort of deal, like as if Sims left and went to a City Hall or something.

I would also be interested in looking into mod creation myself for something like this, if anyone could give me tips on where to get started-- something where I could learn how to create prompts, custom text boxes, and perhaps ""intervals"" via buffs or unseen timed events (think the pregnancy function in-game) so I could simlate applying for a name change and ""waiting for the call back"" to know if the application was approved or denied. I might even wanna make one for applying for ""official legal"" gender change.

I think this could be good for a gameplay aspect. Right now, I have a Sim that got married, took their spouse's name, got divorced, and thought it could add more spice if there was an official option to apply for a ""legal name change"" instead of simply going into CAS and... jarringly change it.

I also can‚Äôt go into CAS or make a new household which is driving me crazy. The game lets me select it and then goes to the loading screen and never finishes.

(It gets hectic when she's working and her own pets are running around attacking patients or distracting people.) She's recently come into ownership of a random white hen named ""Maple"".  


Of course, Maple needed a coop to produce eggs so I bought one. However, I didn't realize they were so big and while I got it to fit in the apartment, it just barely does so. Too bad you can't get a smaller, single-bird box. It's adorable seeing Maple strut around the apartment and chasing the dogs! (Also does anybody else wish they had a pet chicken??)",1641867687

Hi everyone! I recently added MC Command Center to my Sims 4 game to alter some relationships (namely to add siblings) and while it worked at first,  the screen went blank and I ended up saving and exiting. 

Once I reopened the game, the family trees and relationships of most of my sims are now messed up. Sims whom have never met before are now showing up as siblings at random.

I keep trying to manually remove the relationships but for some reason they keep showing up. Am I doing something wrong? The only mods I have installed are Slice of Line and the base of MC Command Center. Thanks in advance for any help!",1641883141

thesims,2022,1,"So I had a sim where I wanted to unlock all the career items, which meant I had to do both branches of each career on him. Normally this wouldn't be possible, but I realised that the Get Famous expansion gives you job offers that set you before the branch choice, meaning I could get an offer for the branch I missed after beating the other one.

This went fine for a while until I realised some career items were still locked even after I definitely reached the requirement for it. I'm pretty sure the branch I picked normally without the offer unlocked its items fine, but the items from the branch I got from a job offer are still locked.

Is this a bug? It kind of sucks because I know you can cheat all the items in, but I wanted to try to do a legit playthrough of getting everything. Does anyone know any possible fix or alternative?",1641890926

thesims,2022,1,"I stumbled upon a book series called Three Dark Crowns a few years ago. It is a book series written by Kendare Blake.

The book series is about a fantasy medieval island were you have 5 different ""tribes"" living. All these tribes have a different power and culture. You have the poisoners, who are immune to all poisons and also very crafted in making antidotes. They like to eat/drink everything coated with poison. The natrualists are those who can control vegetation and have an animal companion. Elementalists can control the elements (shocker). War gifted are skilled warriors who can also control weapons to move on their own. Oracles can see the future in different ways; visions, tea reading, smoke patterns etc.

The island is always ruled by a queen. The queen is said to be a deity reincarnated. She will be married of to a prince from a foreign country to establish political allies. Due the magic of the island, the queen always gives birth to female triplets. The powers of the triplets are known at birth and the babies are shipped of to high ranking families of their corresponding tribes to be fostered there. The queen will leave the island after giving birth and never returns; a council rules in her place till a new queen rises.

The triplets get raised seperately and are never in contact with eachother. They are all trained in both politics and in their powers. When the girls turn 16, they have to kill eachother till one remains. They have to do that over the course of a year. If they do not succed, they get put into an arena till one remains.

The new queen rules the island till she gives birth to the next generation. This can be within a year after crowning or 20 years later.

Not every queen has as powerfull abilities as her sisters. One can be almost Avatar Aang like in elemental power, while the other can barely handle even the lightest of poisons.

When quadriplets are born, this is seen as sacred. The 4th baby will be the queen by default, the other babies will be killes off.

Now here is my challenge;

-Have a female spellcaster Sim. She is your starting queen. 

-make a palace like house.

-you can only pick one of the schools of magic to master in. Having two gifts is seens as an extremely bad omen in this universe. 

-pick two families in different worlds who will be the foster families. They will raise the babies. They do not have to be spellcasters themselves. I usally choose the Goths and the Landgraabs or the Charms.

-since the Sims 4 basegame only allows twins and triplets, use twins as the default number of babies that have to be born. If there are triplets, the 3th baby will be queen by default.

-the reigning queen must marry a non occult sim, from a world that is not the same as she is living in or one of the worlds that you choose for the foster families.

-when the twins turn into teens, they must fight who gets to live. Use your spellcaster abilities till one survives.

-make portrets or photos of your reigning queen and hang them to honor the previous queens. The girls who did not make it will have no immage of her.

-make a spooky pit like graveyard for the graves of all the girls who did not get to become queen. The ones who became queen you will delete the tombstone off or bury them somewhere else. Not at the palace.

-try to have the foster families be around for generations aswell.

-when the reigning queen has given birth, she must be stripped of her spellcaster status and never have other children again. She must leave the pallace and move with her husband to another world where neither she or the foster families are from and never contact her daughters again.

Hope you will enjoy this challenge!",1641917012

edit: talked to another advisor, said my copy might have been obtained by ""illegal or uauthorized"" means. I'm assuming this is because I bought it off g2a, but I've never had a problem like this before. At least I now know what the problem is.

Krishna (1/11/2022, 2:38:32 PM): May I please know when did the expansion pack go missing?

skincaretrash (1/11/2022, 2:39:07 PM): Not sure, I just opened up Origin to play it for the first time in a few months and realized that expansion wasn't installed anymore.

skincaretrash (1/11/2022, 2:39:25 PM): I added it to my account in the beginning of July

Krishna (1/11/2022, 2:41:02 PM): I would like to inform you that the expansion pack has been deleted on your EA account.

skincaretrash (1/11/2022, 2:44:51 PM): Is there anything I can do to get it back? I didn't even know deleting expansion packs was a thing that could happen.

Krishna (1/11/2022, 2:45:32 PM): Sorry but you will need to purchase the expansion packs again. We would not be able to do anything in this case.

skincaretrash (1/11/2022, 2:45:57 PM): Do you have any idea why it might have been deleted?

Krishna (1/11/2022, 2:47:27 PM): Well if someone other than you like your family member has access to the account and might have deleted it or you only had access to them for a fixed period of time.

skincaretrash (1/11/2022, 2:48:30 PM): No one has access to my account but me. Thank you for your time. I'll see what I can do from here.",1641932022
