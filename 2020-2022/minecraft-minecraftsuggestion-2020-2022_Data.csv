Minecraft,2020,1,"Switch version, if that matters any, Bee update. A few (in world) days into the seed I set out to try and find a jungle, found a village instead, with an Illager outpost INSIDE of it, and the villagers and iron golems being swarmed and killed.

Assuming this is a bug... fix... it? If it's a bug I can't be too mad.

If this is an intentional 'feature' villages just became utterly useless. I'm not against making heavily fortified castles with breeding pairs that are unreachable, but that shouldn't be the only option to get some fresh cookies.

So yeah, Illagers/Pillagers/whatever we're calling them are borderline OP for how useless the villagers themselves are, rant over.",2020-01-01 00:04:06

Minecraft,2020,1,"I have two xboxes in different locations.

These past few days i was using the **1st** xbox and happened to be working on a big build in my newly created world. Each day everything loaded perfectly, no progress was lost, i continued to add things to my world. But, as I traveled back to my **2nd** xbox and loaded up the world, I saw that much of my progress was gone. Too much to continue building. My **1st** xbox is now too far for me to access and check to see if the world is completely corrupted on both ends.

Minecraft,2020,1,"Text Wall Incoming!

So I’m having a bit of trouble. I’m currently playing on vanilla Bedrock edition, and I want to make an adventure map where the player has to manage an addiction to mundane potions while progressing through the game. I have the score “Addiction” set in the sidebar starting at 12. The problem I’m running into is that a command block attached to a clock (clock is super fast but I’m most reliant on tick delay in the command block, which ive set at 600 for 30 second intervals which I will increase to 2 minutes once I get this working) with the command “/scoreboard players remove @a Addiction 1” isn’t working and it’s not telling me what’s wrong. I’ve tried adding points as well and changing the power source and tick delay And making it repeat, but no luck. I would also appreciate help increasing the score by drinking mundane potions, and setting effects to happen at score 20 (nausea and poison) and at score 4 (blindness and slowness). If you could also figure out a way to kill the player at 0 and 24, then that would be great as well.",2020-01-01 02:55:32

Minecraft,2020,1,"Hello community! I was wondering if anyone had a list of see-through blocks that stop water. As an example, i know that iron bars, signposts, and glass panels can all stop water, but you can walk through or around them. I'm looking for other similar blocks that would do that. 

Essentially, I am making a water elevator system (using soul sand or magma blocks) that I want to be able to use, but I'd prefer to be able to walk through the entrance rather than opening a door or walking around blocks. My current solution is to use iron bars that are straight up and down (and not connected to other blocks on the side), so I just go in at a diagonal. But this still means I have to go around a block, and I have to assume that other solutions exist. These blocks would have to be able to be on all sides of the elevator the whole way up, since each block of water must be a source block.

Something like sign-posts that I can make without attaching them to another block would be ideal (or if I can place the block, place another block on top, and then destroy the first block, that would be cool too).

The more free-standing the better! Thank you for the help, Reddit!",2020-01-01 03:29:36

I haven't changed the world settings whatsoever, yet the entire world seems to be completely dominated by ocean, plains, spruce forests, normal forests and mountains. With nothing else.

Even the oceans seem to have a lot less sunken ships than in java edition.

Is there actually a difference in the quality of Windows 10 Worlds compared to java? Or is it just my imagination. Maybe I just got an unlucky world but it seems to be completely barren in terms of certain biomes and even the usual amount of ocean structures.",2020-01-01 04:12:32

Also, does anyone know of a good sirens mod that has loads of sounds (nuke, extreme weather, tsunami, lockdown). I need it to be redstone activated and to turn off when the redstone is removed.

Considering how plentiful coal and iron ore is after a certain point, the leap from basic iron to hardened steel seems... well... logical. 

Also, wouldn't copper fit into the game rather well? It could be used to boost redstone signals or provide new items and serve as a equipment tier between chainmail and leather. 

Silver alone could easily work as a special tier similar in function to gold, but with the added perk of being extra damaging and resilient to undead mobs exclusively.

I tried finding a tutorial on it but I made this months ago, so here's some facts about it:

•It's over the ocean and 185 blocks into the air

•A giant sealed cube with a drop chute for the mobs to fall down (8 levels, 4 platforms each.)

•Redstone operated to active dispensers and pour water from a bucket to drop mobs.

which also makes it useful for fighting the Wither as well as Wither

Skeletons) for 3 minutes.

Essence of Energy

Requires: 1 Cake in the middle, 6 Sugar above and below, and 2 Swiftness

I potions in the remaining slots.

Unadulturated Energy

Requires: 1 Essence of Energy in the middle, 1 Jump Boost 1 potion next

to it and another swiftness 1 potion next to it, 3 sugar above and

3 sugarcane below.

Unadulturated Energy in a Bottle

Requires 1 Unadulturated Energy and a Glass Bottle.

Purified Energy

Requires you to pour Unadulturated Energy in a Bottle into a cauldron,

add a Bucket of Milk, 3 Sugar and then place a Cake on top of the

cauldron, place a campfire below the cauldron, and wait for 1-2 minutes.

When it is done it will make a sound like fire being put out. Collect

with a Glass Bottle and you will recieve Purified Energy. On use, it

provides you with Speed 2 for 20 minutes, Jump Boost 2 for 16 minutes,

Sugar Rush (immunity to all negative effects) for 30 minutes, Saturation

for 5 minutes, Vigor (2x faster attack speed and bow draw time) for 10

minutes, and Night Vision for 15 minutes.

Fish Trap

Requires: 1 of any kind of raw meat (exluding all fish) and 2 nets will

make 2 fish traps.

Every 0.5-1.5 minutes it will generate 1 Cod, 1 Salmon or 1 Pufferfish.

After 5 uses it will need restoring (1 of any raw meat exluding fish

will provide 2 restorations-the durability bar of the meat will be

halved).

Slingshot

Requires: 1 Leaf Fibres (gained from breaking the leaves on trees, 4 leaf

fibres can make 1 string) and 4 sticks in a Y pattern around the leaf

fibres will make a Slingshot. Ammunition is Cobblestone, making it an

ideal starter ranged weapon if the player does not have enough string or

is too vulnerable to go out and get some, making it also useful for

getting rid of cobblestone. Draw time is 0.8 seconds and it deals 4

damage for a fully drawn shot (each 0.2 seconds of draw time adds 1

damage). Easy to craft and use.

Makeshift Items

Makeshift Sword

2 leaf fibres around 1 wood planks and a stick below the planks.

2/3 the damage of a wooden sword but has 1/3 more durability.

Makeshift Pickaxe

Same recipe but the place of the planks and stick are swapped.

1/3 faster mining speed than a wooden pick but 1/3 less durability.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Battle Axe

3 Iron Bars in a straight upwards line and 2 iron ingots at the top next

to the iron bar. Has 1/2 the attack speed of a sword but does 2.5x

more damage. Hold right click for 2 seconds to deal an attack that

knocks enemies back by 2 blocks in a 3 block radius.

&amp;#x200B;

Camouflage Chestplate

Requires 10 leaf fibres and 6 sticks.

Place 2 leaf fibres in each space in a half square shape at the bottom.

Put 2 sticks in each space at the top and bottom until you get a

chestplate shape. Has 1/2 the protectiveness of leather armor. Good

starter armor though, and it reduces the radius of mob detection by

1/4.

&amp;#x200B;

Camouflage Leggings

Requires 8 leaf fibres and 6 leaves.

Put 2 leaves in each space at the top in a line across, and then

put 2 leaf fibres in each space until it makes the shape of leggings.

Has 1/2 the protectiveness of leather armor. Good

starter armor though, and it reduces the radius of mob detection by

1/4.

&amp;#x200B;

Camouflage Boots

Requires 4 leaf fibres and 4 sticks.

Put 2 leaf fibres in each space at the bottom between an empty gap

and then do the same with the sticks above the leaf fibres.

Has 1/2 the protectiveness of leather armor. Good

starter armor though, and it reduces the radius of mob detection by

1/4.

&amp;#x200B;

Lava Lamp

Requires 1 bucket of lava, 4 glass and 4 obsidian to make

4 lava lamps. (Stackable up to 16)

Double the brightness of a torch, and harms mobs that touch it.

Basically a brighter, redesigned, more deadly lantern.

&amp;#x200B;

Combustion Trap

Looks like an innocent pressure plate on top of a piston but when touched

it bursts into flames. Flame lasts for 14 seconds when activated.

Requires 1 of any pressure plate at the top, a dispenser below it, and a

observer below the dispenser, as well as 2 redstone on each side of the

dispenser. When placed it does nothing when stepped on but when activated

by a fire source it will make a clicking sound like a button and when

stepped on it will burst into flames. Even mobs do not notice it,

apart from the clever skeleton. Kills creepers instantly if they touch

it.

Mechanical Core

Requires 6 Iron Ingots, 2 Redstone and a Redstone Repeater. Place the

ingots in a 2 lines upwards, put the repeater in the middle and the

redstone above and below the repeater.

Fireball Launcher

Requires 1 Mechanical Core in the middle, a Flint and Steel below it,

6 Iron in 2 lines upwards next to the flint and steel and core, and

a Redstone Repeater above it.

Right click while equipped to open it. You will recieve a furnace-like

GUI. Place a flint and steel on the bottom slot, and as many Fire Charges

as you want on the top. Then left click with the weapon to fire the equal

of a Ghast Fireball. Each 4 shots consumes a single fire charge, and each

shot consumes 1 flint and steel durability.

&amp;#x200B;

Backpack (FINALLY!!!)

Requires: 1 Chest, 14 Leather and 2 string.

Put the chest in the middle, 2 leather in each space all around the

chest in a U shape, and 2 string in the remaining space.

This makes a Backpack. Put a Backpack and any Chestplate into a crafting

table together and you get a Backpack on a Chestplate. Backpacks have 12

spaces. (Either this or you wear the backpack in your chest slot,

just like the Elytra).",2020-01-01 11:24:07

It is powered by the level at the bottom on the face of the dropper. Currently, the lever in the off position leaves the door open and subsequently when it's in the on position the door is closed. I want to instead use a button to open the door. With the current system put in place, the door is already open and hitting a button temporarily closes it before opening again. I'm looking to have either one of two things happen: 1) Hitting the button once opens the door. Hitting it again closes the door. or 2) Hitting the button temporarily opens giving me enough time to run inside. Option 2 is preferable.

I also seem to have an issue with some of the video settings and associated lag. If I launch my game with my mipmap levels set at 0, then change the mipmap to 4, I suffer a performance loss dropping my fps from an average of about 160 down to about 80 or so. When I change the mipmap back to 0, the performance loss doesn't revert and I stay at about 80 fps. If I were to change mipmap back to 4 again, my performance hit compounds and I drop to below 10 fps. Again, changing it back to 0 does not reverse the performance hit. This can be repeated multiple times to a point where I end up with 0-1 fps and can only be fixed by restarting the client.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't recall having either of these issues on 1.14.4 in either the MultiMC launcher or Vanilla launcher. I have also played on single player, a local server, a remote server, and a realm, and the issues mentioned above are present on all of them in 1.15.1.  In both versions I had 2bg dedicated for launch, and 6gb max, which should be way more than vanilla needs.

&amp;#x200B;

Has anyone else experienced anything like this or is it just something with my rig?

[Hello All, I've spent a while working on different designs for a Kelp Cooker \/ Smelter, and have finally been able to come up with a over complicated design that should theoretically work with any fuel or item that needs smelting. It works by using a comparator to generate a signal based on the content of the furnace and then sends a one tick pulse to enable the fuel hopper. The slight Bug \/ Feature is that it will send 2 ticks after the first fuel is burnt through, due to the Observer registering the furnace as stopping and then starting, however by doubling the the the amount of items in the furnace, this should counteract any negative effects as well as make it more compatible with fuels that have half item burn times. If anyone can think of ways to improve it please feel free to comment! I made this after not finding many other designs for such a thing so thought it was worth a share \(even in its current state\)](https://preview.redd.it/x25109uyn6841.png?width=685&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=702d02d6d0ec393bc9ab850f929d7603593a14e7)",2020-01-01 15:20:00

Minecraft,2020,1,"So I posted this a week ago and got little to no response. On the bedrock edition store I lost all my purchases after updating to 1.14, the update that added ps4 to bedrock, however my problem isn’t one ps4 it’s on switch. I’ve seen this occur on ps4s online but not seen a switch do it. I had trouble signing in with my Microsoft account but now it’s working. I assumed once it worked my problems would be over but no.I gave up and went to play without all my punches but the worlds wouldn’t load and would instead crash.

After the 1.14.1 update I thought it would be fixed but I still couldn’t access my purchases, worlds would load but still no access to any market place content. This includes the super Mario mash up pack the comes with the game. I also don’t have any minecoins despite previously having some. This issue did persist over platforms (switch, mobile, win 10) but now only happens on the switch version.

I’ve tried deleting the update data but that didn’t do anything and now all I can think of is to erase all save data for Minecraft. I don’t want to Incase that does nothing but it’s all I can think of. I had bought skins and texture packs and worlds. And I don’t want to have to rebuy them as everything still works on mobile now so I know my account hasn’t been reset. I sign in on the same account (I only have one) on other devices and it’s all there!

Does anyone know how to fix it or should I just delete all data and hope for the best?",2020-01-01 15:36:27

Minecraft,2020,1,"So my younger sister likes to play MC on PS4 with me. Around our base we have 2 villages and one illager base. One village is located in the desert and the other one in a meadow type of place, close to the illagers. We destroyed the illager base by pouring lava onto it because they were being annoying af, but all villagers seem to have disappeared from their homes! We’ve been able to find four desert-Villagers nearby their home but they refuse to go back. My sister put them in mine karts, two died on the way but we’ve put the remaining two in a little home we’ve built for them, hoping to breed them so we can eventually repopulate their village. As for the other village, more seem to disappear every day, last time I checked there were only 2 or 3 left so we may have to relocate them to the little home too. Does anyone know if this plan will work, and why this happened in the first place? Is it just something villagers do or is something wrong in our game? We’re both newbies to MC and big softies, so we feel bad about the villagers not feeling safe in their houses lol",2020-01-01 17:08:31

Minecraft,2020,1,"# Yes! You read it right, this command adds:

* 2 New classes; Suport Archer and Mage.
* 53 New items and craftings including;

1. 4 Upgradable accessories (Yup, an entire new mechanic).
2. 10 New potions.
3. 9 New tiped arrows.
4. 7 New weapons.
5. 2 New armor sets.

* Exploration reward revamp throught the new item crafting.
* Expanded Archer and Tank classes.

You only need to use it once and adds 0 lag, how? Using a custom villager of course!

For convenience sake this command is split into 6 diferent villagers (but could easily be crammed into a single one);

Minecraft,2020,1,"1.15, trying to make a villager plant an old water-harvested wheat farm for me. I know I could get the villager to harvest for me but I want wheat, not bread and the water looks cooler.

I dropped six stacks of seeds, eight stacks of wheat and three stacks of bread on a villager (in that order and he didn't pick up all of the wheat) he has no one to throw to and I haven't seen him do anything with all the food I gave him. He still harvests the fields (which I don't want him to do) He even leaves all the wheat and seeds on the ground which is even more annoying. Did they change the ""I'm full I'll just plant now"" part of farmer villagers which is described [on the wiki](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Villager#Farming)? or am I missing something. Thanks.

Minecraft,2020,1,"You know when you want to go to sleep in a server because you're being attacked by phantoms - but someone is AFK fish farming? Well, if you are OP, here is something you could add to your server WITHOUT USING MODS.

These command-blocks will make it possible for 1 player to skip the in-game time to day without needing others to sleep. This also features a 'kick from sleeping' if you don't want someone to skip to daytime. You can also sleep through heavy rain!

&amp;#x200B;

Make sure you build the following in spawn chunks or use /forceload.

&amp;#x200B;

Enter these commands in the chat.

First, use these to keep the chat and log clean.

/gamerule commandBlockOutput false

/gamerule sendCommandFeedback false

/gamerule logAdminCommands false

&amp;#x200B;

Then, you need to use these to set up the scoreboard system:

/scoreboard objectives add sleep dummy

/scoreboard objectives add KickBed trigger

 

Then, have your command blocks in this setup ([https://imgur.com/a/HxqKlQ5](https://imgur.com/a/HxqKlQ5))

Left to right will be 1 - 6

Farthest to closest will be A - D

&amp; - Repeat Unconditional Always Active

% - Chain Conditional Always Active

\# - Chain Unconditional Always Active

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;**1A**: execute as u/a store result score u/s sleep run data get entity u/s SleepTimer

Minecraft,2020,1,"So I’m working on a map rn wherein one portion has a giant screen that uses custom written maps to display a huge image. 

Issue is, the current way I have to change displays is by killing the item frames of the previous picture (using a /tag system) and summoning in all 150+ maps/item frames with individual command blocks.

I’ve been thinking of ways to make this easier. For example, I could preload all the displays elsewhere and TP them into position with a tag system. Issue is, I don’t know of a way to preserve their location relative to the other item frames. (They’d all teleport to one block, and that’s no good)

I could instead summon them all in with one command block, potentially running each summon command in itself. This would make it so where I could use external text editors to change the map ids for later commands, and I wouldn’t have to rewrite the code for each of the 15 displays. Problem is, I don’t know how to do this.

If there are any other ways to accomplish this, let me know!! I know that I can do the idea I have in mind, I’m just hoping that there’s a more efficient way to do it.

(If there’s a better sub for this let me know,,, i can move it elsewhere)

TL;DR: I need to summon in a bunch of entities at once, and I’m too lazy to have a command block for each of the 150+ entities. pls help",2020-01-01 20:13:23

We've tried fencing the village off and lighting it all up which stops the villagers escaping and keeps the zombies out, but the pillagers just end up shooting at them and killing them anyway. Also, our golems keep finding their way out - can they jump over fences or something?

Minecraft,2020,1,"First off, PS4 Minecraft.... don't question it. I play on PC most of the time. So i understand PC basics when it comea to hardware and software stuff. So of course PS4's have limitations compares to PC

Just giving warning out there that the PS4 update v1.14.1 is hella buggy.

I wanted to hop on PS4 minecraft with my little nephew. I downloaded the dragon mod world and updated some of my old survival worlds i had on the internal PS4 drive.

So below i have some issues I've encountered that i can't seem to wrap my head around due to the hardware limitations of the PS4 with the new update for 2020's v1.14.1. I would of thought MoJang would of optimized for the PS4. All issues i mention can be solved by going to editions in the main menu to the older version but you won't be able to have modded maps or online features like text chatting in a map.

1. When loading old survival worlds that are very large in builds, then when you save and quit, it can take up to 30 min to save and exit to the main menu. If you were impatient like I was by turning the PS4 off, you will lose that file and it will get corrupted.

2. The new update doesn't allow you to just quit a map. There is only a save and quit option. Before you can disable autosave and had a option to quit without saving.

3. When converting your maps to the new update, if you revert editions you wont be able to load that map.

4. When trying to split screen you must have two PS4 accounts. The second account doesn't need to be a paid account. Split screen is buggy and have lots of dropped frames.

5. When split screening on PS4 in any new world or modded world in creative mode, only player two can have a fully creative experience while player one can't open the creative mode menu containing all items in the game.

6. When selecting items such as food with the (+) icons sign indicating more selectable options, the PS4 will momentarily freeze and have dropped frames when trying to cycle through items.

If you have other bugs you have encounter on PS4 comment below.

So yeah PS4 wasn't ready for v1.14.1",2020-01-01 21:15:21

Minecraft,2020,1,"So basically I've got a 1660 Ti and a Ryzen 5 2600 and I have no problems except on minecraft. My GPU doesn't boost at 1920 Mhz like it usually does while playing other games but it stays at arround 1500 Mhz, at idle pretty much and 15% usage. I get arround 80-110 fps which doesn't even max out my monitor's refresh rate and it's not even close to what I've seen from a guy on youtube palying with my exact config (200-300fps). So yeah I'm not playing on crazy chunk render or anything like that. I've tried Vsync, fps limiter, forcing OpenGL to use the gpu in the nvidia control panel for minecraft.exe and javaw.exe, I've reinstalled minecraft already. My cpu usage isn't even that high so i don't really know what's going on. If someone has a solution it would very much be apreciated :)",2020-01-01 21:33:00

Minecraft,2020,1,"The vertex far lands hold some of the most spectacular terrain Minecraft has ever seen. I don't think anyone has ever posted a picture of the sky variant of this, so here we go.

Mods used: CubicChunks, [Far Lands](https://github.com/thistestuser/farlandsmod)

Seed: -936504578442456880

&amp;#x200B;

[The beginning.](https://preview.redd.it/0jhndfdlk8841.png?width=1404&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=66a2df0e60ddecc0a13fee984e47289894dab294)

&amp;#x200B;

[At this point, the terrain is entirely solid.](https://preview.redd.it/urcgzjw9n8841.png?width=1328&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=87170f26193595f39553cad60cddf49f891ffb80)

This is how one corner of the sky far lands behaves, in one seed. In other corners or other seeds, the behavior changes completely. And if you throw in the farther lands, the behavior becomes incomprehensible. Here's a gallery to preview:

(Note: CubicChunks was modded to allow visiting past X/Z &gt; 3E7 and Y &gt;1 billion.)

Minecraft,2020,1,"Okay a quick thing to get out of the way, if you don't want to read the context behind the build then just skip the text and move on to the attached image, if not thank you for reading this.

So to get things started, i use to play minecraft a lot as a kid (im 17 going on 18 on the 15th) i loved the game and still do i used to play the Xbox 360 version mostly and me and my brother spent hours playing the gamer bonding together, but as we got older our living situation worsened, without telling my whole life story lets just say our mother thought the men she dated where more important than her kids. So because of that at a early age i started acting up to get attention, that included developing a horrible procrastination habit. So because of that is stared failing school, putting off important things, and being lazy all the time. But now im gonna be graduating soon and i wanna get into a really good college but i know if i wanna go to that college and stay there i have to break some old habits. So to start helping me get to that goal i made a simple new years resolution, finish a game of minecraft start to finish, it may sound stupid but i have not seriously played minecraft, every time i start a new world i build a basic house get bored and not touch the game for months, then when i go back to play i forget what i was doing and start a new world just to do the same thing  over again. So im so proud of myself because i finally made a proper house, its a nicely built, fully decorated both inside and out, its got a farm and two animal kennels. Im so excited about this because for the first time in a long time i can say i completed a task without procrastinating.

For those who read the whole post i thank you so much, and for those who skipped to the pictures i hope you liked the build. Well that's all for the day ill post again when i make updates to the house, thank you for reading and have wonderful rest of your New Years Day.

Minecraft,2021,1,"Hey all, so I've been working on 1.12.2 with a minecraft map I was making (and have been working on for awhile now.) I was almost done with it when, suddenly it stopped appearing on my list of minecraft worlds despite the file being in the save folder. I tried looking it up (online sources say something in it corrupted), and the fixes it suggested haven't worked. This problem has really killed my hype for working on it especially since I was almost done. I was wondering if there's anything I can do to save the builds so I don't have to redo everything. Here's the world file (but as a ZIP) [in google drive form](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gNm1pQGWdFk4bTTVKdieJavdnDMoh3n-/view?usp=sharing). This file is before any of the fixes, so it has no changes since the corruption.   
If there is anything I can do or should do please let me know.  
I've already tried seeing if this was just my computer but it still doesn't show up on the other computer in our household. Also, if it makes any difference, I had a custom made texture pack on during and prior to the incident.

The nether itself is already super dangerous, providing natural defenses due to the less then friendly inhabitants. Combine that with the fact that you would need to know the location ahead of time in order to find it underneath a lava ocean, and the problems of actually getting down there, and it seems pretty safe to me.

But, there is a small problem with that, how do I actually get in there without getting fried? The lava is easy, just brew up a ton of fire resist pots, but how do I build an entrance underneath 40 meters of lava?

I like the idea of having it available mostly for when I go afk--just in case I'm an idiot and go afk somewhere that's not as safe as I thought it was. I know in the past it's generally been considered a bad enchantment because of how expensive and high maintenance it can be, but with its durability usage being fixed in 1.16.2, has that changed? Is it considered worth it these days, or is it still looked down on as being a poor choice for general purpose armor?

At the start, all players have leather dyed armour  to differentiate between their colours. They will also know if they are the imposter at the start 

Unfortunately, there is no tasks or anything for the imposter to sabotage. However there is a large network of caves for the imposter to sneakily kill someone. Crewmates can also kill crewmates, but they won’t know

So the players spawn in a small restricted area with materials to build (wood) but no materials to mine. Players need to basically get good tools to PvP.

Minecraft,2021,1,"....It's so relaxing and it honestly sends me to another plane of existence whenever I hear it. It's like a portal to a new world that I can shape with my own two hands to make whatever I want. It's a portla back to simpler days, where my imagination could run free and just be itself. It makes my entire soul just feel at ease, a universal message that tells me that I'm going to be okay. That no matter how bad things get, there will always be a better brighter day awaiting for me. And as I wait for that day, I'll always keep listening to Minecraft music, as it helps purge the doubts from my mind that the world will never change for the better. Because the world will always keep changing; it's a known fact. If it gets better depends on the people who want to make the changes. And as this year draws to a close, I hope that every single one of us can help change the world for the better.

Happy New Years.",2021-01-01 06:52:53

Minecraft,2021,1,"As you may know, levitation is a (very annoying) attack from a mob called a Shulker. You kill them to get shulker shells to make shulker boxes, a kind of chest but if you break it the items stay inside.

Anyway, sometimes there's a lot of shulkers and they start making you float away. What do you do? I have a solution.

Bring a bucket of water with you to the end city. If you're floating up to someplace where you foresee danger, place the water on a nearby block and get inside the stream. Any body part in the water. It stops you floating immediately and you can swim and move around inside the water with no evident levitation effect. Just wait in the water until the effect expires, then continue on your journey.

Exploration wastes hunger and risks a lack of a base when the night comes, and in this mode, you can starve to death, and mobs are far more ready to absolutely obliterate you. Instead, quickly find a place to call base, try if you can to quickly find an area with no high hills nearby, and build a simple wall, 2 blocks high, with a block one higher and one further away from the base. Doing this with ANY block prevents all except Endermen (for obvious reasons) mobs from intruding on your base, including spiders. After this, set up a shack of any size and material, and continue getting materials, avoiding any remotely dim locals and getting torches as a priority. Once night falls, now is the time to mine, rather than finding a natural cave a spelunking, simply dig a diagonal path tracing the walls of your house, doing so till day breaks. With a small shack, a wall serving you well for many days to come, you can begin your quest into the harrowing yet satisfying quest of surviving and thriving in your hardcore world.",2021-01-01 08:32:44

Minecraft,2021,1,"Recently  me and my friend decided to create a map art completely in survival.  After finding a program that turns an image into blocks, we started the  long and tedious process of collecting the blocks. After that, we used  the program to see exactly where to place each of the blocks. This is  all done by hand, and takes an extremely long time to do. We completed  about half of it in 3 days. This is absurd when compared to Java.  Schematica's printer feature could probably do it all in a few hours.

The main point of this post is asking if there is any program for bedrock that is close to schematica.  
It would make the process of creating map art on Bedrock significantly easier.

Even if there was a mod to make a layout/blueprint of the image, me and my friend would greatly appreciate it.

These would be neutral mobs that would be found in small ""camps"" inside a cave, where they would have a Campfire. If one gives them any type of Meat, they would start following the player and help them defend against enemies for a certain amount of time. Cooked Meat would give more following time than Raw. Maybe there could be different types of Cavemen who could do different tasks, such as mining, chopping wood etc. Their weapon would be a new weapon called a Bone Club, which could do around the same damage as a Stone Sword, but would be able to mine certain blocks faster than a Sword would.

Their drops would be EXP, obviously, a relatively big chance of dropping Leather and a small chance of dropping their Bone Club.

Minecraft,2021,1,"I have been working on a bridge across the lava in the nether and I managed to forget to hold shift and run off the bridge into the lava like an idiot. However instead of dying and losing my fancy pickaxe, I just could stand in there. I didn't take even half a heart of damage. I just built a staircase from the bridge to me and got back up. Now I am very happy to have not lost my levels or enchanted gear, but I am honestly quite perplexed. 

I think it's important to note that this is in a realm that I share with one of my friends. This friend does have a tendency to use cheats and creative mode and all other things that I quite frankly don't understand to help the both of us out because we are hopeless. However, this friend hasn't been on the realm in a week or so, and I have died from lava in the past.

Most of new games need 64bit just to launch them and also, i could now allocate more ram to MineCraft, so i don't have to play on few fps (I can't allocate more ram on 32 bit). Well i downloaded minecraft and it automatically allocated 2GB of ram (I have only 4GB). I was kinda happy at first, but then i tried to actually play the game. It didn't worked well, i had lag spike every few seconds, it was unplayable. I've tried allocating less ram like 1.5GB, it helped a little on older versions like 1.8, 1.9 but 1.16 is still unplayable. I've even tried having only 1GB ram allocated but it didn't worked. I've also tried optifine, but also didn't worked. I've tried reinstalling MineCraft, didn't worked also. I really don't know what to do, but it is annoying. Well i have found something that kinda helped me, i've decided to try fabric mod ""Sodium"", and that worked for some reason. I mean don't get me wrong, i am still having lag spikes now and then, but i don't have lag spikes literally on MineCraft menu.

I've logged out and logged back in to Minecraft, reinstalled it, switched off my poweline ethernet adapter and connected to good ol Wi-Fi, flushing my DNS server, heck I even completely factory reseted my computer and nothing was working. 

We had fixed the problem in the past by changing the server hosting websites, but I don't want to have to do that again because that'll cost more money. Coincidentally, both of my friends had used the same hosting website, MCProHosting. 

Another thing to note is that I had a laptop I used for school and I could connect to the server using it just fine but it was so laggy that it was unbearable to play on it.

Minecraft,2021,1,"TLDR What should I get Java version or Baseline?

SO I want to find a game that lets me enjoy playing on my PC more since I usually play games on console. I have never played Minecraft and not really even any similar game unless you count a sim game or Stardew or something, but since Minecraft seems fairly complex to control it seems like PC would have an advantage over the console ports. That being said I don't really see what the difference between the two versions are other than social things where baseline version can do crossplay. I have no friends that play the game though either so Im not sure that will come into effect as much. Are there any other differences I should be aware of? Are there mmo-like aspects where strangers will show up in my game or is it true solo experience unless I specifically invite someone in?

Minecraft,2021,1,"I didn't found the crawling speed in minecraft after looking it up. So I decided to measure it myself. Speed in the Tl;dr.

I only did the experiment once, so I really encourage other people to try measure it too. I also don't have footage of it, so don't use it if you need an absolute precise answer.

Speed is distance/time, so we just need to keep track of both.

**Distance**: I counted 119 blocks (I meant 120, but I did a mistake and it ended up one short) and putted a pressure place in the starting point and ending point)

I tried to keep in a straight line, which I think made me move slower, because the tunnel was 1 wide, so even if I drifted a bit, the speed in the wouldn't have changed much.

**Time**: As soon as I touch the first one, a signal is send to a piston that activates a hopper that connects  2 chests (so the speed is 2,5 itens per second), as soon as I touch the last one, the hopper is desactivated. The hopper moved 229 blocks in that time, so time was 91,6s.

The system that activates the hopper is symmetrical (the delay to start is the same to finish)

*TL;DR*

**The crawling speed is 1,3m/s.**",2021-01-01 19:55:29

Minecraft,2021,1,"Hi,

I am also a fellow minecraft player but by profession I am an AI developer/researcher. I have always looked at using minecraft for doing AI research as the world is very open and limitless. I have seen there are few projects like CraftAssist, MineRL and MineFlayer which allow us to control minecraft for this purpose but they come with their limitations. So, I am thinking of using Forge to create a client side mod myself.

I haven't created any kind of minecraft mod or plugin ever and haven't really worked with java too. I am proficient in python but I am hoping that I can pick up java for this project.

Basically, the features I am looking to create with the mod are:

1. Be able to control the player using python code while the client is open on the side so we can see the game. By control I mean, looking, walking, crouching, breaking or placing block, etc. I have heard that raspberry Pi minecraft has something like this.
2. Be able to get the live frames from the first person view of the character. This is so computer vision algorithms can be applied using python. This is something I haven't found yet in any existing mods or APIs.
3. Finally, it should be client side so that it works on most multiplayer servers as well. Basically, so other devs can interact with other devs' coded bots.

My question is can this mod be created using minecraft forge in java while allowing for python to ultimately control the player?

I would really appreciate it, if you can tell me whether it's possible with forge and if so, some high level pointers to get me started. If there are existing mods or APIs which do this with python interoperability do let me know. (Point 2 is actually the most important aspect).

Thanks!

P.S. if anyone is interested in collaborating for this open source project, let me know.",2021-01-01 19:57:20

My username uBird was rare to find and a nice name. But Redpolls was  something that described me in everyway. This is silly that i have to ask reddit lmfao. But its hard to get any sleep when its a game that you main. So i just wanted to ask if you thought uBird was a good name or Redpolls. Any help would be appreciated.

I have no idea what they are but they seem to be related to xbox gamebar?

whenever the launcher would crash, I would get an error code 0 and a new one of these files would be created, so they are either the source of the crash or some kind of log about the crash I'm guessing.

If anyone knows what they are an explanation would be greatly appreciated. When inspecting them in file explorer, they don't seem to have a file location and they cannot be deleted, so if they are the cause of the crash idk what to do.

Minecraft,2022,1,"A few weeks ago, I started a multiplayer survival server for 1.18. No issues there.

The problem is going back to my old creative worlds started anywhere between 1.13 and 1.17. They're all suffering the same problem. I start playing and everything is fine, albeit a bit slow. The game, however, just keeps getting slower and slower until it is unplayable. All this typically takes around 20 minutes before the situation is intolerable.

I've done this with both vanilla Minecraft and Forge/Worldedit Minecraft. Same result with both. At first, I thought that perhaps the game was just working on generating the new terrain below the Y0 axis, but I don't think that's the case. I've started one world in particular at least 10 times already and it's the same problem.

I haven't tried running any of these on a server yet. Anyone think that might help?",2022-01-01 06:39:43

Minecraft,2022,1,"So of course, we have extended the mining operation accordingly:

https://imgur.com/hMnWt6k

Normally, we use world edit to take our 'city' to a new map, whenever a new release is made. We were quite surprised to find one can mine below level y0 and keep going until about y-64.

The item on the left of the screenshot is a double-barreled glass item elevator. It is two droppers that push items into the base of a glass column to take items from y-64 to y+100 to get to the item sorter. We used to use rails but as the world got bigger, mechanical things, like mine carts, often get stuck or need restarting. In some rare cases, mine carts may disappear between games. This solution, which is based on one I saw on Avomance's YoutTube channel takes a lot of glass (4x3x164), but is solid-state and keeps going, no matter what. Of course, it works with any solid block, but looks 100x cooler in glass.

In case anybody asks about the column of chests/hoppers, the idea to alternate hopper/chest to get the items to the bottom of the elevator: this is a easy way to save iron in early game, since a chest is less resource to create than a hopper, but still works, like this, for this purpose.

My main goal  will be finding the end portal.

**I get pretty fast lost if I'm not sure where to start.**

I would start like searching a food source and while I'm looking for that I would start farming wood , stone and mabey iron and Cole if I'm lucky finding it fast.

I would try to farm some food that I dont have to care about it for a while + farm more ores for equipment  and then I would start looking for a village to settle down. Starting building a house , mine and try to figure out how you use villagers for getting cool stuff. Ofc I would start farming in nether for XP for enchantings (the best xp source I know are thos ores for the white smooth blocks )

**But now I think I wouldn't know what  the next step is.
Can I start trying to find the end? Or should I do the nether boss first?this water tempel thing?does it even matter?**

Do you have a tipp what I mabey have missd to do on my plan? Or next steps I should definitely try?

Minecraft,2022,1,"Hello Minecraft gamers,

I am currently in the middle of designing and building quintuple (5× Spawner) Cave Spider farm which is realy challenging because of how cave spiders works. I might post here my design once I am done. But for now I want to share some remarks and ask some questions:

– Firstly, I hate Cave Spiders AI. The climbing on the walls is annoying so you need to kill the climbers with water on top of the spawning room. **Is there any option how to prevent this?** I was thinking about dropping them 20-25 blocks down so their AI would be messed by a bit.

– Secondly, many people have issues with getting spiders to water elevators. The best thing that worked for me is with using Iron Golems which will lure them into the water (using tricky blocks like Daylight Detector or Stonecutter)

– At last, which designs are effective for killing chambers? I use combination of well placed stairs which prevent cavespiders from poisoning the player.

What are your remarks? What changed since the original designs back in the old days? I want post here detailed design of the farm later but for now I wanted to ask you for any of your remarks, designs and ideas.

Happy new year!",2022-01-01 13:45:00

Minecraft,2022,1,"My 6 year old son has been playing Minecraft on the switch since Christmas. In his world, he found a broken ship on a beach that he made his home. I know he built a bed but I doubt he registered it. 

I haven’t played Minecraft in a while but I know the basics. He drifted off to adventure and he can’t find his ship now. Is there any way to easily locate this even where he didn’t register his bed? I used a compass to get back to spawn but can’t find it.

I've successfuly transfered my world to that folder, but now I'm wondering something...
When I uninstall the app will the world's folder be deleted? Everytime I uninstall a app the android/data folder get modified, and so I assume that the folder from the app is deleted. This means that deleting the app will delete my data even if it's on external? Or no? If yes, them this change is so bad :((((

They only posted the story series, and episodes were posted erratically, so it wasn’t just a regular YouTuber making it. The series was extremely popular, but I can’t seem to find it. It was not an animation, but simply players being recorded. It followed a character living in a village that sometimes visited a scientist or doctor who lived in an oddly shaped vertical-like house. The details are blurry for me, but I do remember them finding an old ruin in a mountain, making potions in a secret basement, a farm with glass as its walls, and them using a lectern-like block in a “church” well well before the lectern was in the game. This was around 2014 I’d say, and it sounds like something that should be on r/lostmedia, but any links to videos would seriously help me. Finding this series has been killing me lately.

4. Mods with wizard stuff where you can use spells.

Is this just a difference in the brands, or could I be missing some drivers or something? I messed around with some Java settings, which was suggested on some other posts I read, but could there be anything else I would need to do to increase the FPS?

In my offline world I only started mining, building a little shelter and I discovered a big cave while mining. The exploring the world, finding new recipes, building my shelter (also making it beautiful) is a lot fun to me. How can I translate that to a multiplayer server?

I THINK that unmodded vanilla survival servers are best for me. But I don't really know. I already joined such a server but then had to go through a tutorial that shows me how I can claim a zone in the world to start.

Swamp: Oak &amp; Spruce wood  
Badlands: Spruce &amp; Oak woods, and every other stone basically

I personally like to keep palettes simple, not saying that doing complex and big palettes is a bad thing btw. I also wanted to point out that certain blocks are a must in biomes, Glass (except Desert which i use Spruce fences in), Composters, Barrels, all the interactive blocks in the game, etc.

* Are there any free dedicated servers out there so we're not playing on our own computers and it can be accessed 24/7?  
   
* Is there a benefit to ditching the Java version and buying the Windows 10 one?

\-- I managed to reset the password, but I still find it very unusual, the entire event made me feel weirded out. 

Ordinarily I play on Bedrock edition (I have both Java &amp; bedrock, some friends lack a PC but have console editions), but today I felt like opening Java to play alone on a new, hardcore world. While attempting to log-in with the password I last remember using on my account, all variations plus any password I remember recently using on other accounts would not work. So naturally, I go to reset my password, which is easier said than done. But upon logging in, I realise that my username was changed to something (I hadn't done myself) August 4'th, 2021 at 2:08 A.M. (allegedly). This  perpetrator attempted changing my account's password as well, which I can only assume was successful, though oddly enough I still have access to this email which they sent the password request to. 

My account skin was also changed to something unusual, I only have done surface-level reverse image searching, so I don't know where the source is. I doubt that it was something made only by the person who had hacked by my account, as according to [LABY.net](https://LABY.net), there are 50 other users using the same skin (I found this out while trying to search the username my account now had). The username that my account now has is ""2Solution\_"". 

My purpose posting this is should I be worried? I have saved the skin that my avatar now is wearing and have screenshots detailing specific times when the person attempted to change my account password through email, then supposedly when the username was changed courtesy of [LABY.net](https://LABY.net)",2022-01-01 20:42:00

Minecraft,2022,1,"**GOAL:**

I want a Pickaxe with Mending, Efficiency 5, Fortune III and Unbreaking III.

I have 3 villagers:

Villager 1 = Mending (12 Emeralds)

Villager 2 = Fortune III (9 Emeralds)

Villager 3 = Silk Touch (5 Emeralds)

Villager 4 = Unbreaking I (1 Emerald)

____________________________
I'm wondering if the Unbreaking 1 villager is worth it or not, because I don't want to get stuck with having to use 39 XP to make my pickaxe. Making an Unbreaking III (UBIII) book would require 4 UBI's, which would lead to a high level of XP needed to craft. 

**(UBI + UBI = UBII) + (UBI + UBI = UBII) = UBIII**

To then add my Mending + Fortune III + UBIII would cost a ton of XP or cap out XP cap right? Or am I not understanding how anvil works? I'm just wondering if I should reroll it and grind out an UBIII villager for like 20 emeralds, or if I should take the UBI?",2022-01-01 21:32:31

Minecraft,2022,1,"So I used to make mobs ridiculous by manipulating the power of commands. So I made one more command-made powerhouse. And this one turned out to be the mother of destruction.

It's name is the City Keeper. It appears at the very top of the end cities, appearing as a six stack of shulkers. This becomes more apparent as when the base is killed, the boss splits. This mob would appear as the final boss of the end city. It would even have a boss bar!

Please don't try fighting this. You will either die from the barrage of bullets or the absurd fall from the crazy levitation. Good luck with fighting this! To recreate it, I put the command below:

/summon shulker 8 -60 8 {CustomName:""\\""The City Keeper\\"""",Passengers:\[{id:shulker,CustomName:""\\""The City Keeper\\"""",Passengers:\[{id:shulker,CustomName:""\\""The City Keeper\\"""",Passengers:\[{id:shulker,CustomName:""\\""The City Keeper\\"""",Passengers:\[{id:shulker,CustomName:""\\""The City Keeper\\"""",Passengers:\[{id:shulker,CustomName:""\\""The City Keeper\\"""",CustomNameVisible:1}\]}\]}\]}\]}\]}

It's too long to put in chat, so you can put this command in a command block. Just copy the above paragraph, and then paste it into a command block. Good luck with this! Don't die!

Minecraft,2022,1,"I play minecraft with a few of my friends on a personal server. We play on hardcore, and if anyone dies the whole world is reset. I like the hardcore play style, which forces you to be much more cautious. However, it can be a *bit* annoying resetting when anybody dies, and I've got an idea for something in between. I was wondering if anyone knows how to implement this.  

The basic idea I've got is that players are divided into ""teams"" with different access based on the number of times they die. Specifically, blocks placed by a team with fewer deaths than you before you died, cannot be broken or used by you. This prevents you from reclaiming an old house and makes you lose any items stored within that house. Also, your ender chest should be emptied, and ideally, your items would only be retrievable by those teams with fewer deaths than you.   

This would give a sort of class hierarchy where those with fewer deaths have an advantage over those with more.  

Alternatively, I'm interested in any way of playing that gives this kind-of hardcore experience, where you pretty much lose everything on death, but maybe the world doesn't need to be entirely reset.  

I'm open to any suggestions.",2022-01-01 22:12:20

Yes, I did switch the settings in the Nvidia Control Panel to use my dedicated GPU for the Minecraft launcher, Java.exe and javaw.exe. in fact, I switched it back to integrated, and fps was identical. Made zero difference.

Intel i7 10750H 16gb RAM 3200mhz Integrated: Intel HD 650 Dedicated: Nvidia RTX 3060 Laptop GPU

Windows 11

Could this be a windows 11 issue? My last laptop was Windows 10. Drivers are all up to date.

Edit: no other game has this issue. Forza Horizon 5 ran like butter on Windows 11 on this exact laptop

I'm part of a realm with amazing people, with a lot of work put into the whole world. Unfortunately, the owner isn't able to keep it running... I believe the owner is playing on xbox. We would really, really like to find a way to download the world - at the very least (so we can each keep a copy) or (preferably) figure out how to switch the world over onto another member's server... or even just transfer ownership (if possible). 
Does anyone have any ideas/suggestions on how we can save our realm? 
I know we could just start a new world on the other member's sever but we all have worked extremely hard on this realm and it has some incredible builds! It means a lot to the whole group. 

Personally, I play on xbox one and I also have a switch. Additionally, I also own mc mobile (but haven't played on it before) and have a laptop (older but has a decent amount of space) and a few portable data banks that I could use. 

Thanks in advance for any ideas and help!",2022-01-02 00:32:57

Here's what I know about the lets play:

\-2 men (80% sure they were scandinavian)

\-Over 100 episodes

\-Very old version of minecraft (definitely before full release)

\-They built quite a large base consisting of many smaller builds

\-For some reason I remember ""wolf"" or ""atom"" being in the name, but this may be a red herring

\-There was no thumbnail for the videos

There is a chance this series is lost to the ages or has been deleted, but I was hoping someone who also watched it might be able to enlighten me!

Main goal: Relocate the means to find these powerful enchants to encourage exploration and dungeon crawling. I feel that something as powerful as Mending should not be exploitable, as it's entirely possible to cure a Librarian to get cheap deals, and then reroll the trades until you get mending, meaning cheap Mending.

And before you try to use bad faith arguments, I'm well aware of the ""Just don't do it"" arguments. I intent to make this either a datapack or mod and share it with friends or on the web. Or if I make a server. Plus it allows me to learn and make mods I have ideas for.

I know I’m not going to the end nor am I even able to fight the ender dragon (I just died to a bunch of silverfish after all—btw, did their spawn conditions change?), so I spawned myself a shulkerbox to fill in with my first geode since I was so far from home and I knew I wasn’t going to be able to find this cave again. I filled it up with all my goodies and some of my best gear that I didn’t want clogging up my inventory, went to pick it up with my iron pick, and *poof* gone. Don’t tell me I needed silk-touch, because I really thought I didn’t, and it’s the reason I don’t use ender chests because I don’t know to how to enchant gear either :,(",2022-01-02 01:58:53

Minecraft,2022,1,I made Bookshelf with wooden Sculpture,2022-01-02 02:00:13
Minecraft,2022,1,"Allow me to explain the whole situation:

I downloaded a texture pack called Stay True using Optifine to make my Minecraft look better when building. (I'll put the link in comments.) I followed a YT tutorial to get Optifine and it works fine. However, I wanted it so all birch leaves are pink. The pack has it so birch leaves can be either orange or pink. It says to go into the Stay True files, copy the texture files for pink leaves, and copy-paste them into the orange leaves folder. So I go in, copy the texture for pink leaves, and then find I cannot paste it into the orange folder. Usually I would ask my tech-person brother for help, but he's very sick and I don't want to bug him while he doesn't feel well (or possibly catch what he has). So I keep trying, but then I decide ""Okay, just get rid of the orange leaves entirely"". I delete the entire orange leaves folder and it does...Nothing.

So then I download another pack called Alternate Leaves (also gives pink leaves), and make sure it runs over Stay True, thinking it would just give me the leaves I want and leave the rest to Stay True. Instead it makes all the leaves very buggy with that pink and black checkers pattern. To fix this, the Stay True site says to delete the colormap folder. And when I do so, well...Now EVERY SINGLE LEAF BLOCK has that checkered pattern, birch or not. The birch leaves are pink but still have that terrible checker pattern. The only way to stop this is to disable Alternate Leaves but that still keeps the birch leaves orange.

After all this I try to just uninstall Stay True altogether. Except IT WONT LET ME! It says ""the action cant be completed because the folder is open in OpenJDK Platform binary"". I looked it up and a website said to stop Java in TaskManager but Java isn't IN TASK MANAGER.

This is literally a nightmare. I have stressed out so much over this, I literally just wanted pink Minecraft leaves. I could just use Alternate Leaves only and that would make the leaves pink, but I REALLY like the way Stay True looks.

CAN SOMEONE \*PLEASE\* HELP ME? I know nothing about anything other than ""drag zip file into resource pack file"".  


  
UPDATE: I was able to uninstall and reinstall Stay True but I still can't replace the orange leaves with the pink ones.",2022-01-02 02:00:33

I know I can fix it by just blocking line of sight to the zombie for a little bit (and i tried it, it did start the farm again), but that is a hassle and not something I have had to do in the creative world one I made at all.

It just looks like the villagers have given up on sleeping and are just sitting at the end of their rooms running from the zombie forever.  (Iv been making sure not to sleep as sleeping to soon can break them I hear.)

Any ideas?

The worlds we created are set to Multiplayer as well. When checking the version on both of our games, we are using the same one (1.18.2)

I also tried to relog both our Microsoft accounts multiple times to see if that would solve the issue, which it didn't.

Minecraft,2022,1,"I had the best horse i’ve had in a (bedrock) survival world, nametagged it, and put it in a stable, and logged off. Once I logged back on, he was nowhere to be found. Is this a known glitch? How do I prevent this from happening again?",2022-01-02 04:10:51
Minecraft,2022,1,Why is their no way to increase render distance in realms on bedrock?  Me and my friends had a amazing base idea with a beautiful view but now that it’s realms we can’t see anything.  I know this is a thing for lag but their should be a way to change the render distance in realms so your not stuck at looking at 12 chunks only.  Especially with caves and cliffs this is more annoying because their is so much more that I can’t see now.  And I don’t even want to think about how impossible exploring the end will be because you can’t see end city’s from a far meaning it will be almost impossible to see the end city’s.

Minecraft,2022,1,"I've always been a fan of Minecraft and have watched a dozen of YouTube videos to help me understand it. I finally got a gaming laptop and want to pick the game up. I have a few questions that I would like to check on. I know I'll have more and I'll work my way through them when it comes up.

My questions to the lovely community are:

1. Which version should I pick up? Java or Windows 10 edition. I have read the comparisons on the website but I would like to get your input. I currently do not have friends to play with. I might persuade a friend but that is not priority right now.

2. Any basic tips/tricks for a beginner to pick up on? Is it similar to Animal Crossing (oy thing I can think of right now) except the villagers in it? Make buildings, craft stuff and design as you wish? 

3. I understand there are 2 modes (Creative and Survival). Is one better over the other if I just want to invest my whole time into one? 

4. I've seen people play with different kind of maps (I'm sorry if that's not what it's called) like Hell and Middle Earth. Is this something I would need to download separately and have it installed into the game? 

5. Is there going to be enemies that I need to fight in each modes that I pick? Or is it something that I would need to add in like a mod? 

Thanks in advance.",2022-01-02 04:39:05

Minecraft,2022,1,"So to preface this, I don't follow update news super closely and haven't played Minecraft heavily since shortly before the cave update to begin with so if this is a known change I apologize. 

My issue is I've found it almost impossible to find obsidian while exploring caves since I've started playing post-cave update. Previously finish huge sheets of obsidian deep in caves was pretty common, but I've had no luck finding anything like this or really much in the way of lava lakes at all. I've definitely noticed other changes with generation of systems, aside from all the new elements design is generally just a lot tighter and seems to expand downward mode than outward. I'm thinking maybe lava lakes have been mostly eliminated because of those structural changes but even without finding larger lakes it wasn't uncommon before to find smaller patches of obsidian where water and lava spawned close together, but I've found many areas where both are close by but there's no obsidian to be found. Again, I'm assuming this is connected to changes made to caves as deep cave design is very different in general, but finding obsidian was something I was used to in terms of strategy and how common it was and now I've explored more than 3 separate deep systems without finding a single block. 

I know there are little nether structures that generate throughout the world that I can get a bit of obsidian from, but I need a good amount for my portal room and those don't generate a ton of obsidian and don't occur very close together in the world. Is there a new method I'm missing to find obsidian in caves or somewhere else? Is this an issue anyone else has had? I'd really appreciate any advice because I've been playing the game for a long time and am feeling very frustrated finding no luck at something that's always been a very basic task.",2022-01-02 08:56:17

1. An entirely new CITY/TOWN! The new city or town will feature more stuff than the original area!

2. A trailer park!

The trailer park will feature loot, zombies, and a fallen water tower! (Watch out for drowning!)

3. A subway system! (It’s on ground floor, flat world.) The subway system will feature a crashed subway, and more zombies and loot!",2022-01-02 09:43:40

Minecraft,2022,1,"Hey everyone, 

Don’t know where to ask this. If this breaks the rules, please let me know. (I can’t find this anywhere for 1.18.) My sister and I built an iron farm in our survival world. Got it working for a little while (like 40 iron) and then it stopped working. We used Wattles’s 1.18 design. (We’re in Java, 1.18). 

They have beds, jobs, the surrounding area is spawn-proof. I duplicated the world and killed all the villagers/passive mobs in the area. I blocked the villagers’ line of sight to the zombies and then broke the blocks again to reset them. Still doesn’t work. Any idea what could be causing it to bug out/how to fix it? Much appreciated. Thank you.",2022-01-02 10:00:56

For the first time ever I made netherite armor by myself and even my first automatic farm. It isn't much but it means alot to me. Me and one of my friends got a little cocky earlier this evening and spawned a wither and at this rate it has escaped the underground and we may lose the world. So if we do end up losing it after the hardest battle of our lives I would just like to say thank you to the pogsmp for being the best minecraft world I have ever had",2022-01-02 10:15:02

Minecraft,2022,1,"My suggestion for the wild update is fog. It's a block that you can walk through (and if you do, slow down), pick it up with buckets like powder, or just replace it with a block. Monsters see the player from further away when the player is in the fog. The fog is a block that naturally spawns over water from swamps, mangroves, and rivers when the chunk loads for the first time. In this state only the player can remove it. But if the block appears in the event ""foggy night"" and ""foggy day"", then it will appears in greater ammounts also over Land but will disappears after a while. If the player is in the fog, he gets less visibility, which can be increased a bit with light sources and light falling through the fog becomes weaker with each block.",2022-01-02 10:20:55
