skyrim,2020,1,"I recently bought Hearthfire (yes, I know I'm late), and after building my first house, I of course wanted to adopt some kids. After adopting Blaise the stable boy from Solitude (edit. accidentally said Riften first), I had much trouble figuring out which girl I should adopt. There were many girls with cruel faiths, but hearing Sissel, you know, the girl from Rorikstead, telling me how she has to take beatings from both her father and sister really broke my heart. So I knew I needed to adopt her.

My biggest problem obviously was that she already had a father. So the sensible thing was to murder him. I broke into their house at night, only to see Sissel and her sister Britte awake (at almost 2 AM!!) while their father was asleep. I figured I should leave the house and wait until morning. I couldn't let my future child witness me murdering her father, now could I?

In the morning when I saw Lemkil, the father, at his farm, I got an idea. What if I didn't murder him? What if... something unfortunate were to happen? Pleased with my evil plan I sneaked away until no one saw me and casted fury on Lemkil. He immediately screamed ""Never should have come here!"" as he charged to try and kill his own daughters. What, did that man just tell his daughters that they should never have been born?! How cruel! The guards shot two arrows into his chest and killed him. A perfect crime. Nobody would suspect a thing. Everyone would remember Lemkil as the evil, cold man who finally snapped and tried to kill his daughters before he had to be put down by the guards. And that's how I got to adopt Sissel. What about her sister, Britte, then? Pff, off to the orphanage.

Oh, by the way. When I went home to Lakeview manor, a courier ran to me. He had a letter of inheritance for me. The deceased person who had left me an inheritance was, you guessed it, Lemkil. Truly, the perfect crime...",2020-01-01 00:29:52

skyrim,2020,1,"Game not functioning properly; need help

For clarification I’m not a new player, just starting a new game. 

I have a main game I stick with and wanted to start up a second to try out a different playing style (I’m a heavy warrior on my main game, wanted to try out an assassin and a mage). Problem is during the Helgen scene the game just stops functioning properly. After I enter the keep it just doesn’t do anything. It doesn’t recognize that I’m in the keep so it doesn’t allow me to complete “enter helgen keep” to move on in the game. I can move around but the characters stay in place, they’ll move their head but that’s it. Once I’m up the stairs is when it happens. The characters don’t go anywhere either they just stare at me, like they aren’t completely frozen just completely forgot what they were doing I guess.

I was able to jump out the window and could see the dragon just chillin mid air, not moving and frozen in place. Up until this point the game works fine, and I have absolutely no problems with my main game. I’ve reloaded, gone back to the last save, started up another new game but it just always stops functioning properly at that same point. I’m on a switch lite and I have no extras or mods running. I just have the one main game and the two new games that I haven’t been able to use due to the issue stated above. 

The game card isn’t full or anything I have plenty of storage. No clue what could he going on.

skyrim,2020,1,"I see a lot of posts here of people who get stuck due to bugs, etc. It used to happen to me too, but quite a few can be solved by reloading.
You can set the game to *auto save every time you enter a new area, fast travel and open the game menu, every 5, 10 or 15 minutes. This can be done by opening the Quest menu, scrolling to System, it's in Settings.
Might lag the game a bit while saving, but it's a good way to avoid wasting the time you put in. Just remember to reload the game as soon as you get stuck, otherwise you could end up overwriting them. It's helped me more times than I can remember.

Also, happy 2020!

She is a level 82 breton, played in Elegy Mod (less carry weight, less loot, a couple other rebalances). I also played under the self-imposed restriction of ""no armor rating at all"", so that expert difficulty turns into ""oneshot or be oneshot"", and holy shit, she died a lot. Even with 600 health, dragons immediately enter their ""nom nom"" animation on her.

She is almost immune to magic, though.

Her main skills are destruction and sneak/dagger, but of course at this high level, she spent all sorts of perk points in all sorts of things (like the complete alteration and restoration tree, speech and all three crafting skills at 100 etc).

With a mod that grants ""fortify destruction damage"" enchantments, her chainlightning does about 400 damage, which is enough to kill a legendary dragon in about a dozen shots or heavy Draugrs in 3-4 shots, but doesn't totally trivialize all content.

Her outfit  is the skimpy version of the emperor's robes (from ""UNP mashup compilation"", I think), gained from his dead corpse. I combined it with the non-skimpy parts of ""DeserterX spartan bard"" (torso is NSFW). The Dagger is from the ""JaySus Swords"" pack, of course the weapon also needs to be skimpy. ;)

I went out of my way to keep the weapon damage at 666, juggling with different fortify enchanting and fortify smithing potions. Took me about an hour to get it right. I am proud. ;)

Things I learned this playthrough:

* You can sneak murder Harkon while he still talks to Serana, and skip the boss fight.
* I found a Dwemer ruin that traps you in a cage and then drops you a couple hundred feet.
* You can drop soul gems to empty them (all these years, I sold my misfilled grand soulgems)
* There's a Pirate Quest in Windhelm Harbor
* There's a weird quest given by the guard to Mercer Frey's house. It would take 2 seconds to kill him, or you spend 3 hours diving in the lake near Riften, looking for something Maven BlackBriar wants from him. Yeah, sure I will take the second option.",2020-01-01 10:20:43

I have just killed the emperor and the guards outside the sanctuary, ""death incarnate"" starts, new objective: enter the sanctuary, when I enter the sanctuary, the marker points outside, I go outside, it points to the sanctuary again, so the quest doesn't progress, no problem just use console commands, new objective: search for survivors, I kill the guards inside find nazeem, no quest updates, I try to kill arcturus, he's intangible, doesn't take damage and my weapon doesn't even make sound when touching him as if i'm stabbing nothing, progress the quest, new objective: kill arcturus, still can't.

the earliest save I have is from when I just got out of the emperor's dining room

&amp;#x200B;

I just don't know what to do, sorry if I wrote too much, I thought you guys need details to identify the problem.

Sahloknir on its own isn't that much of a problem for me, but the thing is, near the end of the fight there are always hired thugs coming after me. I'm really bad at fighting them, especially during another fight.

skyrim,2020,1,"I have been playing Skyrim for way too long now and one of the things that has always bothered me was how the player becomes the leader (or an equivalent position) in almost every faction. 

The one which bothers me the most is becoming the Arch-Mage. The College is not some small guild where a bunch of mages gather for fun, its an institution and is thus very important. I always found it weird that the next Arch-Mage is some student who joined the College a week ago. I can get by the whole Psijic Order chosen one part but that doesn't mean that I should become the next Arch-Mage. Moreover you don't need to be a mage to complete the questline. I completed the questline with my highest mage skill being at 30 (Destruction). 

This got me thinking of some changes in the College questline to make it more believable. Hear me out.

**FOR MAGES:**

**Joining**: Same as vanilla

**Progression:** The Saarthal quest will only start after a few days after joining the College and only if you any one mage skill above a certian level (30+). Keep it such that you will get quests after 'Hitting the Books' only after you reach a certain skill level in any one of the mage skills (say 50+). 'Staff of Magnus' will be available after you reach another skill level (65+). In order to start the side quests (J'zargo, Brelyna, etc.) they must recognize you as a fellow student, i.e it will be available only after a few days after joining the college or after completing 'Under Saarthal'.

**Becoming Arch-Mage:** You can be Arch-Mage only if you complete any one of the Master-level spell quests (i.e. you become a master in that particular skill) or if  you have 100 in any skill. This way the player will be a powerful and respected mage and it would make sense to be appointed as the Arch-Mage. If you complete the questline and you haven't satisfied the above conditions then Tolfdir will be the acting Arch-Mage and will offer you the position once you satisfy the conditions. (this one was inspired by a mod '[Immersive College of Winterhold](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17004)') 

&amp;#x200B;

**FOR NON-MAGES:**

**Joining:** You see a notice (or the courier informs you) that the College is looking for someone  to act as body guard to assist with their recent excavation of Saarthal. You thus start the questline directly at Saarthal.

**Progression:** The questline progresses similar to vanilla, except the Psijic Order chooses Tolfdir instead of you (but Psijic mage doesn't freeze time so you can hear the conversation). The rewards for the quests will now be septims instead of magical atrefacts or scrolls. 

**Becoming Arch-Mage:** You don't . Tolfdir does.

&amp;#x200B;

Okay this is what I think would be a bit better and sensible College questline. Tell me what you think about it and suggest any changes.",2020-01-01 18:37:32

I don't believe that those deaths have something related to a dragon or a vampire attack, because it always happen when i'm not on the city, so i'm starting to think that this is some kind of mod problem.

The thing is... I just exceeded myself, and added a whole bunch of mods at the same time, wanting to try all of them in the same save (And probably shouldn't have to), so i'm not sure what mod (or combination of mods) are causing the problem.

skyrim,2020,1,"I just started the imperial civil war quest, and I went to clear our Fort Hraggstad. Well, I did the outside and I went in and there was an extra bandit.

This bandits name was Dangerous Herbert?? He had armor way above my level and literally was able to regenerate health. I had to reload the game on an earlier save, and I went into there and he’s gone. He wasn’t supposed to be part of the quest.

Has anyone else had this happen?",2020-01-01 23:38:12

skyrim,2020,1,"On Solstheim, I was attacked by a Frost Dragon. Was almost at my carry limit so I bent its will and rode it closer to Raven Rock. It kinda hovered around a while and then said it had to go. Whatever; Partysnaxx and Odaving are cooler.

A bit later; maybe 10 minutes, I swear the same dragon was still in the area but was now hostile again. So, I hit it with ""Dragonrend"" THREE TIMES and it REFUSED to land. So; I started shooting with arrows and when it got down to a hit or two of health, it just started flying in circles around me. Not attacking. Just flying. It wouldn't attack, land or respond to ""Bend will"". I couldn't land a shot.

It followed me across the map; circling. Nobody would attack it and it wouldn't attack despite still being marked as hostile. I only got ridof it when I entered and left a building.",2020-01-02 00:10:08
skyrim,2020,1,"Okay so I asked for ideas for a new rp character and I loved one idea so much that I went ahead and made the character. She’s a Breton named Elabyth Ashwing. She’s an avid scholar and adventure who’s spent the last 40 years in High Rock, Hammerfell, and Cyrodiil searching through empty crypts and abandoned libraries in search of anything that could lead her to a discovery that would etch her name in the history books. She saw her opportunity in a vague reference to some long dead Nord king and immediately set out for Skyrim. She made her way into Skyrim from the south where upon she was captured by the imperials.

After begging and explaining for two days that she had no relation to the Stormcloaks, depressed, she resigned herself to her fate. Silently she walked to the block, knowing there was no way she could ever escape and there was no way she’d ever make the discovery that would bring her fame. And that’s when she heard it. Suddenly she had a new purpose to live, she would unravel the mysteries of the dragons.

As a good citizen of Tamriel of course she decided to escape with Hadvar but she’s never been one to socialize as books are categorically more interesting than *people* and she was still a bit sore about the whole almost being executed thing so immediately after escaping Helgen she told him to do one and headed out on her own. In spite of her solitary disposition, she stumbled upon a stray dog fighting off two wolves just meters away from the cave and couldn’t help but intervene. The dog did most of the work and initially turned toward Elabyth warily but after a couple calming words the dog was glued to her heels. Elabyth considered shooing off the dog but in light of the current circumstances (narrowly escaping beheading, nearly being flambéd, fighting off racists with complete strangers, burning a bear to death), she considered this a gift from the gods. She named the dog Gemma.

Thank you u/TerraOrdinem for the awesome character idea, I’m already having loads of fun :)",2020-01-02 00:12:16

skyrim,2020,1,"First time playing through skyrim. Needed a break from the grinding and fighting so I got ready to ask Ysolda to get married. Approached her at the Bannered mare and she was obviously thrilled to marry this humble Khajjit. That same night while celebrating the engagement, I ended up in a drinking contest with some guy named Sam. You might see where this going...

Blacked out and ended up in the Temple of Dibella and naturally started unfolding that quest. Curiosity had gotten the best of this kitty. But first I went to Maras temple and set up the wedding before I forgot. The priest said it would happen the next day so I started to figure out what happened in this Hangover-esque quest while waiting. Went to Rorikstead and some guy said I sold his goat to a giant. I started following the bread crumbs. Well the notification came the next day to go get married but i thought it somehow happened already offscreen. While figuring out the Night to Remember another notification said I had missed the wedding. 

I went to the priest to reschedule and he said my fiancee might not be so keen. So I went to whiterun to confront Ysolda and ask forgiveness. 

But Ysolda is actually a part of this forgotten night quest which I had no idea. At first she was upset and I ended up saying I never loved her in the heat of the moment, but then she started talking about me getting a ring from her for another girl. I was so confused. She asked for the money for the ring but I just intimidated her for the information on sam and told her to fuck off. 

So basically I missed our wedding, borrowed a 2000 gold ring to marry another girl on that same day ours was planned and then never paid her for it. Only after tracking down Sam did I realize that I had absolutely destroyed this womans life",2020-01-02 07:07:59

skyrim,2020,1,"So I started a new game for like the 100th time yesterday and it has been really bugging me that there are so many things that aren’t quit right

1. Right in the first cutscene Lokir says “what’s up with him “ referring to upfront storm cloak clearly not knowing who he was.
How does he not know what he looks like surely there would be like wanted posters or something with a sketch of him on / propaganda with his face on

2. Why Helgen ? I guess it’s closer to dark water crossing than solitude and if it was just the soldiers then that’s completely understandable but the imperials literally have ulfric  stormcloak the leader of the rebellion and there executing him in some shitty little town surrounded by mountains 
Surely solitude would be a much more appropriate place .

3. Similar to point 2 there going to execute ulfric stormcloak and there is a crowd of maybe 5 or 6 citizens too watch it surely nearly every imperial citizen in skyrim would want to see it . Hell when we first get to solitude there’s a much larger crowd for the execution of the guy who helped ulfric escape and he’s pretty much a nobody

4. So when lokir runs away and gets shot why does the captain say “ anybody else feel like running” like as far as “anybody else” is concerned there about to get beheaded so there going to die anyway know matter
 what they do

5. Finally when you first get into the keep there is a locked gate that you kill in imperial captain to get . How are there stormcloak a already down there . Imperials I understand it’s there town fort thing but storm cloaks doesn’t make sense this is especially apparent if you side with imperials at the start how did so many get down there and how did they get the key ?none of them have a key why would they lock the gate ? They are clearly waiting for ulfric still so why lock it again if they do have a key

skyrim,2020,1,"Hey, everybody

So, the very first time I played Skyrim was back in 2011 on 360, when it first released. I had such a blast, but never actually finished it. I remember being both amazed and overwhelmed at the same time.

...fast forward eight years later, I'm primarily on Switch nowadays, so I decided to double dip. I'm about ten hours in now and have just completed the main quest line (&gt;!defeated Alduin!&lt;). I guess the reason why I'm here is because I'm feeling just a tad bittersweet. I don't remember the main quest being so short?

I'm kicking myself now for beating the main story in one fell swoop, as opposed to taking care of some side quests in between. I don't want this to come off as a ""Dear Diary"", but I wanted to see if anybody has done the same thing? I still plan on putting a good amount of time into the rest of the game, but by just doing side quests and exploring.

* He walked through half the continent before discovering fast travel, using signs
* He kept getting killed by an orc so he consumed his whole potion inventory and one-shot it
* He tried to pick-pocket half of Tamriel and can't access Whiterun without being imprisonned or killed by the guards (had to do some console shenanigans to get him out of this situation)

If you think I should include any other spot (groves, farms, shrines, camps, etc.) that seem important let me know!

Now the main issue I have run into is I am not to sure about what animals I should place in which area.  Here is a link to a website that lists all the animals in the game along with the biome they belong into: [http://planetzoopedia.com/zoopedia/](http://planetzoopedia.com/zoopedia/)

He told me to go away and stuff like that, but I wanted to finish the quests. After something like a half hour I just killed the other 2 people in the circle to try and get his attention. When that didn't work, I started attacking him (I honestly don't know why, I just wanted to do the quests). That lasted for about 20 minutes of just stabbing him with no effect. Then I just moved on and did all the other quests I had and the new ones I found. Then a year later I decide to go back to my old save to talk to the man and I went to a save just before I am there. Still, nothing worked. It was my most achieved character, and I was greatly disappointed.
Also, on my most achieved character, I didn't get any trophies or nothing (I'm on PS4) because apparently my dad had a mod downloaded and didn't turn it off when I started my character. I don't know how I didn't notice that it was modded, I just never went to the character section that tells you it's modded. And even worse, the mod did absolutely NOTHING.

skyrim,2020,1,"Hello all,

&amp;#x200B;

I've recently re-modded my Skyrim after reaching the ""meh"" point with my last character, so now I've decided to be a Khajit for the first time ever and have used this as an excuse to do an Unarmed fighter. 

&amp;#x200B;

So far I've been doing the typical perking into Light Armor (Ordinator) and gotten all the way up to Hissing Dragon, which I've unlocked for Shock Damage to great effect. But, at this point, I'm wanting to expand the playstyle of the character out a bit more. Here's the gist of what I've got so far:

&amp;#x200B;

\- Mostly Light Armor perks, obviously, for Unarmed Damage and movement speed bonuses. 

\- A few perks into Sneak, because especially in the early game it was really difficult to kill anything without them killing me first (Morrowloot Ultimate). Having the sneak attack bonus was really helpful in clearing up a few grunts so that I could focus entirely on the leaders. 

\- A few perks into Pickpocket for Death's Emperor and slowly trying to move to Brotherhood Cocktail so it feels more like I'm a true thief/assassin. 

\- A few perks into Alchemy for making more potent poisons and making my own potions. I haven't been focusing too much on this one because I keep finding myself without ingredients and I don't remember the ingredient pairings to maximize my progress with acquiring experience in this tree. First time really using Alchemy at all, even with Ordinator. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now the question is what other fighting/combat skill tree do I want to perk into? I was heavily debating on the Two-Handed tree to use the Ebony Blade, but I'm worried that it will overall be much less effective than just using my fists to fight enemies. I really want to avoid the Archery tree because I started Skyrim with builds that just devolved into stealth archers, and I'll be damned if I go back now. Anyone have any recommendations on some possibly flavorful and effective combat options to spec into for this build?",2020-01-02 23:52:23

I launched the skse with Steam and the game plays perfectly and fits my monitor perfectly, alas I can't get the mods I want on Steam and I don't know how to get the mods from Skyrim Nexus to work when I launch through steam. 

Anyone else have a similar problem? 

Also, I had the game set perfectly the way I wanted it on Legendary and then Steam just changed it to SE without even asking and everything was ruined.

skyrim,2020,1,"# **TL;DR AT THE BOTTOM**

I've been playing on Novice all this time, and it's been pretty fun. Dragons were super fun to fught because of all the little details. They seemed to slwoly become less confident during the fight, and interrupting one of their Shouts terrified them. This might just be in my mind. Anyways, it was fun exactly how tough they were, but I've gotten stronger, and killing Dragons is becoming dangerously close to busy work. So I decided to a playthrough on Legendary (can't wait to fight a Legendary Legendary Dragon...), and I already knew it would be pretty tough. It ended up being a little tougher than I thought, and escaping Helgen was a pretty big and fun challenge. I went to not the best blacksmith in Whiterun, looked in the forge, made a shopping list, bought and sold, and ended up with a full set of Steel Armor, as well as a Steel Shield and Steel Mace. I put a perk point into Heavy Armor, One-Handed, and Smithing. I then tempered my mace and got its damage to 21. I also had a Long Bow and plenty of arrows. I collected tons of Blue Mountain Flowers and Butterfly Wings, and I ended up making 20 potions. I also legally pillaged Dragonsreach because I needed cheese. After all that, I was on my way to Bleak Falls Barrow.

I quickly learned that fighting two wolves was insanely dangerous, and fighting 3 or more was an absolute death wish. Bandits were also tough, but I divided, dodged, and conquered at the entrance and right inside. Using my big-brain smartiness, I managed to make it past the big spider. Now I've freed Arvel in hopes that he would help me fight the Draugr. I think he died, but I couldn't hear or see him over the dying happening to *me.* I can't possibly fight all these Draugr. In hindsight, I really should've invested in Health, but I'm level 5 with all of my level-up points in Stamina. You know my gear. You know my supplies. What do I do? I can use magic, but I don't have any perks invested in those skills, so it probably won't do much. I'm not that scared of the frost magic, because I got to Windhelm to join the Stormcloaks and the guy there gave me Resist Frost potions for killing an Ice Wraith, which I won't do for a few years. Please help me. Thanks for reading all of this!

**TL;DR:** I'm on Legendary difficulty. I've got full Steel armor with a Steel Shield and Mace (Superior) that does 21 damage. I've invested a perk point into Heavy Armor. I'm level 5 and I leveled up Stamina every time. I have all of the unowned food in Dragonsreach and 24 health potions. I can't possibly defeat the Draugr in Bleak Falls Barrow (I am open to sneaking if I must). **What the** *hecc* **do I do?!**

Edit: Thank you to those that helped me a lot. I have carefully used my level-ups and perk points and I have beat all the Draugr, with the exception of the Overlord at the end. I think I have a decent chance, but I can't rely on any health potions for complicated reasons. The toughest part is moving backwards to be able to see him while he runs at me. I can't bail now because dungeons that aren't cleared apparently respawn everything after 10 in-game days, and I think I'm pretty close to that. Thanks again for all the help, and wish me luck!

I've tried initiating combat and exiting combat or paying the fine, shouting and the guard approaching me telling me to stop, sheathing and unsheathing trying to interact with it and went to older previous saves. I even tried to use a forge/grindstone while someone was using it but not even the NPCs will use it. For example, Eorlund Gray-Mane won't even touch the grindstone or the sky forge, he just stands there. Another example, Uthgerd the Unbroken in the Bannered Mare isn't sitting down and shes usually sitting down drinking before you talk to her and have a brawl. Matter of fact, none of NPCs in the Bannered Mare are sitting down. I was thinking it may be one of the mods I have installed but every mod I suspected on messing with interactions I disabled and still no avail. If it helps here is the list of mods I have installed.

skyrim,2020,1,"Hi fellow skyrimers. I've been playing since 2011 and have recently taken the decision to start playing with mods for the first time ever! I've put it off til now because I wanted achievements and also I didn't want to get sucked into over modding the game with hundreds of changes, which can be very tempting.

I'm planning to start my werebear playthrough any day now. Needless to say, after seeing what Moonlight Tales has to offer, I may never go vanilla again. Vanilla lycanthropy looks downright anaemic by comparison, and that's coming from somebody who's always loved playing as a pure wolf.

Aaaaanyway, I've got a nice lil list of about 12 mods now and the only thing I'm missing is something to make the game look nice and PRETTY 😊. Any suggestions? Nothing that drastically alters the appearance of NPCs please.

After getting too close, it started to attack and my thane helped me take it down.

The other thing that happened is that I went to the Battered Mare (or is it bannered mare?) or maybe a store in Whiterun. Inside, I talked to a gladiator-looking woman named Ungreth or something who said she was kicked out of the Companions because she apparently unintentionally killed a man by not holding back. She challenged me to a brawl and I figured it would be a decent way to earn some quick gold if I won. And so, it seemed to be going well as we started exchanging fisted blows. Then, the bitch pulled out her fucking two-handed sword and chopped my shit up. I thought it was scripted until I actually died.

skyrim,2020,1,"About seven months back I made a post where I had gotten every skill to 100 (without cheating unlike some people) as a Mage.  Now I'm doing it again as a Warrior.  I wanted to give a list of all my tips on how to level all the skills.

Destruction: This is simple.  If you're a Mage you'll end up leveling this skill naturally as you'll most likely be using Destruction to deal damage.  If you're not a mage then it's best to wait until you max out Enchanting so you can make an armor set to make the cost of Destruction spells 0.  From here you just gotta go from one corner of the map and revisit every enemy encampment and commit genocide at every location until you max the skill out.  Make sure you don't put points into perks that increase the individual elements damage.  The Exp gained per spell is measured by how much the base cost of the spell is.  You only gain experience when a Destruction spell hits a target.  This means that you must sacrifice damage for leveling faster.  Also know that Rune spells would be your best bet for getting the most Exp per spell overall.  You could trade it out for the ""EXPERT LEVEL DESTRUCTION SPELLS"" once you unlock them but I don't know which ones are best for less damage but more experience.

Restoration: It's hard to level this skill without just simply exploiting it.  You're not gonna Max the skill out by naturally using healing spells as a mage even if you use them through your entire playthrough.  You won't even come close as any other class unless you max out Enchanting first.  If you have the Dawnguard DLC then you can get certain spells that deal damage to the undead and this is an honest way to level the skill.  You could also do this with the Poison Rune spell from Dragonborn, but it'd be more difficult.  At the end of the day don't feel bad if you end up casting some type of the Turn Undead spell on a Dragur repeatedly until you max the skill out.

Alteration: Just cast Armor-Flesh spells before every fight.  Cast as many (different ones) as you can as they all stack.  I don't entirely know how this skill works but just use my advice and it'll start leveling quicker than you may think.  Even as a mage the first Armor-skin spell costs less than 100 Magicka so you could cast it once you learn the spell.  Otherwise it's good to level this once you max out Enchanting while you genocide all of Skyrim whilst leveling Destruction.

Illusion: Just fuck with everyone by sneaking into a group of enemies and cast a Frenzy-type spell on one that you think I below the level threshold.  It's entertaining to watch them all fight eachother while you sit in the shadows like .-.  It'd probably be best to level this skill once you max out Enchanting and go on your Destruction Genocide.    Might wanna cast Muffle before sneaking up on them for bonus Exp.  You could also cast a Calm-type spell on the last remaining enemy to calm them and get an easy sneak attack on them.

Conjuration: In the middle of a fight after you kill an enemy just use a Resurrection-type spell on them.  Simple enough.  Good idea to level this along your Destruction Genocide.

Enchanting: Disenchant Everything you can.  It gives more experience than you may think.  Also make sure to grab as many souls gems as you can along with as many Circlets, Amulets, and Rings you can.  These three are very easy to enchant as they have a lot of compatible enchantments (minus Circlets only having helmet enchantments).  You may think that the higher the level soul gem you use equals more experience.  This is not the case.  Each time you enchant something it gives a static amount of experience that has no connection to the type of soul gem.  This means it's best to save your Grand Soulgems for enchanting your main equipment and Greater Soulgems for recharging your enchanted weapons.  You must level this skill throughout the entire game to max it out as fast as possible.  This skill is very powerful at full potential.

One-Handed and Two-Handed: These two skills work similarly in how they gain experience.  I'll give an example.  You have a war axe that deals 8 damage per hit.  You increase it's damage to 9 on a grindstone.  Does this mean it gives you 9 exp per hit?  No.  The experience only comes from it's base damage.  This means that it's best to never smith the weapon to be better.  You'll be using a peashooter at times but know it's best for leveling the quickest.  This also means that the best weapons to use at the ones with the best Tiers (A.K.A. use Dragon Bone weapons if possible).

Blocking: I'll be honest with you when I say that I've no clue how this skill levels up.  My advice?  Just block enemy attacks when you're leveling one handed together.  It's very straightforward and I can't give you any real strategies unless you just sit in a corner and block for a good half and hour from enemies.  Yet another skill that's hard to level honestly unless you use shields normally.

Heavy Armor and Light Armor: Take damage whilst wearing their respective armor types.  I don't know what else to tell you.

Archery: This levels just like One and Two-Handed.  I've no clue if arrow damage adds to Exp gained so have fun with that.

Smithing: This is a skill you can grind to 100 but not in an exploitive way.  For you level Smithing to 30 by smithing Leather Armor or Iron Daggers repeatedly.  Then you invest into the Dwarven Smithing Perk.  From here you gotta go into a Dwarven Ruin and collect as many smeltable Dwarven metal pieces you can amd smelt them to make Dwarven Bows.  Do this throughout your entire playthrough from the very start to level it the fastest.  Other than this strategy I've no other tips for it.  The experience gained is dependant on the value of what you smith.

Alchemy: Pick Every Single Ingredient You Find.  All of them.  After that eat them all once and go to an alchemy table.  Make what potions you can to further discover recipes.  The exp gained per potion is dependant on the potion's value.  Do this early game for a while before you start using more expensive yet worthwhile potion recipes.  The best potion you can make is:
Wheat + Giant's Toe + Creep Cluster is = 1250 base value.  Wheat can be found on a few farms, Giants Toe can be found on uh... Giants, and Creep Clusters can be found all iver the ground in the hot weird area in Eastmarch (south of Windhelm).

Lockpicking: Pick Every Single Lock You Can.  Do this from the very start of the game.  Even novice ones.  Once you level the skill high enough only start going from Adept, Expert, and Master locks as Novice and Apprentice level locks no long give substantial experience.  I'm serious with every lock you can.  Minus the doors to people homes, that is (unless you don't care about the risk).

Pickpocket: So just go from town to town and steal the most valuable things from NPC's pockets.  The experience gained is connected to the value of what you steal.  There's not much else to tell you for this skill.  This is the most honest way you'll level it.

Sneak: This a pain I the ass if you're not a Stealthy character.  It's beat to max out Enchanting and make yourself some sneak armor if you're not a Stealthy person.  From there use bows to deal sneak attacks on enemies.  I don't entirely know how this skill levels but I know sneak attack damage increases it.  Just do another genocide with bows and sneaking to level this honestly instead of the exploit at the start of the game.

Speech: Ya know all the potion's you made and the items you enchanted to max their skills out?  Make sure you kept them cause you're gonna need to sell every single one.  Make sure you sell one item at a time and not multiple at once.  You may use the shop exploit (the only exploit that is perfectly fine to use) to restock a merchant's gold.    Also sell all your gemstones.

Welp that's every single skill I've talked about.  I hope my personal guide helps!",2020-01-03 18:41:14

skyrim,2020,1,"For those unaware, Vahlok the Jailer was a very chill and honorable dragon priest who was the one that defeated Miraak 7 thousand years ago and ruled Solsteim for a while. Kohnariik is a dragon priest mask that can only be obtained by a special time warped pedestal that can only be unlocked by inserting all 8 dragon priest masks of skyrim onto its overly complex lock (fun fact, the reason why it isn't available in the present is because we took it in the past).

What is an interesting correlation to this however is that Vahlok is the only named dragon priest without an associated mask, and Kohnariik has no mask wearer. This means that it is possible that Kohnariik is something of an emergency super insurance weapon/armor of sorts that requires the approval of all of the Skyrim's top dragon priests to bestow onto a chosen champion for certain, extreme crises (kind of like presidential emergency powers). One crisis that would fit this criteria would be Miraak and his rebellion against the Dragon Cult, who at that point with Hermaeus Mora's power, devoured dragon souls, and his own natural power as a Dohvakiin would be ridiculously difficult to defeat especially when considering that he gets stronger with every dragon he kills and dragons were kind of the best thing he dragon cult could send.

So it is possible that Kohnariik was bestowed onto Vahlok to help him defeat Miraak, which he did, then he had to return the mask to the dragon priest council or whatever to put it back in its seal since that crisis was averted. Another little lore addition to this would be that the only reason why Vahlok attacks you if you reach in his tomb is that he accidentally assumes that the player is Miraak due to sensing them being a Dohvakiin, and his 7-thousand year old, half-rotten mummified body literally can't see nor hear you properly enough to make out the accidental mismatch since he was entombed to stop Miraak in the future in the first place (which hilariously couldn't happen since the dragon cult was destroyed and thus no one was around to wake him up when Miraak started causing problems in the future). 

tl/dr; Vahlok was a badass who may have been temporarily bestowed Kohnariik to defeat Miraak, then by sheer bad luck missed his cue in the far future to stop Miraak for a second time and in senile undead delirium thinks that you're Miraak if you find him.",2020-01-03 19:52:19

Hi fellow skyrimers. I've been playing since 2011 and have recently taken the decision to start playing with mods for the first time ever! I've put it off til now because I wanted achievements and also I didn't want to get sucked into over modding the game with hundreds of changes, which can be very tempting.

I'm planning to start my werebear playthrough any day now. Needless to say, after seeing what Moonlight Tales has to offer, I may never go vanilla again. Vanilla lycanthropy looks downright anaemic by comparison, and that's coming from somebody who's always loved playing as a pure wolf.

Aaaaanyway, I've got a nice lil list of about 12 mods now and the only thing I'm missing is something to make the game look nice and PRETTY 😊. Any suggestions? Nothing that drastically alters the appearance of NPCs please.

I'm on xbox one. Thanks so much in advance, my eyes are now open!",2020-01-03 22:47:04

skyrim,2020,1,"Aye, my life... a sad one, to be sure. Maybe reflecting will bring me solace in the end. 

The first thing I remember. Awaking on a spring day. Chipper and glad as I can be. My mother making the best goat anyone could make. I believe I was no older than ten. A storm was brewing, but that didn’t matter. My father was asleep in his bed. Always made fun of him for that. If only we knew why at the time. 

My mother was a nice lady. Too nice for her own good. One night, she snapped. My father was asleep at the farm, and I wanted to learn how. Help him out, and contribute to the family. He wouldn’t wake up. He was alive, but a few weeks later, we figured out something horrid. My father was a skooma addict. Late at night, he downed 6 bottles, and stole a war hammer. He tried to break down someone else’s home. He almost brought down a supporting pillar, that would’ve made the house collapse. My mom left him. He was not fit for a father. 


We rarely saw him after that. Me mom, always wanting to be a farmer, learned it from a man named lemkil after we moved. We moved often, but always stayed in the north. We finally settled in Winterhold, and I took up some magic. Wasn’t much. Just a basic healing spell, to tend to accidents on the hunt. Eventually, My mother grew ill, becoming sick with the disease of vampires. She begged me to kill her. I told her no. I searched far and wide, but not one person knew of a cure. All except one. I cannot remember his name, but he told me to bring her. When I went to get her, she was killed, or so I thought. She had killed herself, for she feared what she would become. I couldn’t believe it. I ran. I started farming a few miles south of falkreath. Going back up to visit my mothers grave, as I do every year, I was captured. These imperial bastards captured me! I believe it was the talos amulet I wore, but they say it’s because of crossing the border. I lived in Cyrodiil, yet they thought not to check. These bastards will pay. Divines, why must I suffer.

Plus unlike the alternate start mods you can still access Creation Club content. I haven't run into any bugs.

New Game Shack.
A shack in Helgen with some pretty good gear and equipment to start you off and it has doors to Alvor's house in Riverwood, a door to Dragonsreach, a door at the very end of Bleak Falls Barrow (it lets you get the Dragonstone and get our but you will have to go back through it if you want to do the Golden Claw quest.), and a door to High Hrothgar. The shack also serves as a nice player home complete with an alchemy laboratory, an enchantment table, and general ammenities. Remember that bandits do spawn in Helgen so be prepared for that. 

Teleport Rings and Spells
This collection of rings and Spells can instantly transport you to any of the holds, any house (build the Hearthfire house first otherwise it is just an empty cell), faction headquarters, and access to places otherwise inaccessible like Azuras Star, Atherium Forge, the Thalmor Embassy Party Room, and much more. Do be careful as some of these places are quest related and might mess up if you go there earlier than you were supposed to. Only glitch I found was when teleporting to Dimhollow Crypt. It puts you right in the room where Serana is and when I completed the puzzle she was outside her box rather than in it but otherwise acted normal.

Blink - Short Distance Teleport
A fun little quest gives you the ability to teleport up to 100 ft with different kinds of effects depending on your skill and the visuals you want. They come in Ghost, Mage, Shadow, and Void. Cast it like any other spell onto any surface and you will teleport there. You can even go through gates.",2020-01-04 06:28:02
skyrim,2020,1,"I have found a bulletproof way to remove quest objectives that remain lingering after failed quests.

Short story is that you need a mod to override the failed one and new version should have no stages or objectives. You need to save the game, exit, activate the mod, load, save again, exit, deactivate the mod and continue with the game.

Here is the longer version. I am doing it with a SSE Edit. Pick a small mod which you  don't want to use. Open it in SSE Edit. Find the failed quest in Skyrim.esm or DLC esm, wherever the quest is coming from. Remember the numerical (hexadecimal) quest ID. Then go to your mod, add a quest section, if it doesn't have one. Then add a quest to a section. Use the same quest ID that you have found above, Save the edited mod. Overridden quest has no stages and no objectives.

Now you activate the mod. Load a saved game with objective being stuck. When you check the journal, the objective should be gone. Save the game again and exit. Now deactivate the mod and start a game again. The objective should be gone.

It is also possible to do the same with CK.",2020-01-04 06:35:23

skyrim,2020,1,"You'll note that most faction questlines are relatively low-stakes and concerned with the future of the faction itself. Restore the greatness of the Thieves' Guild and Dark Brotherhood. Fight the enemies of the Companions and rid Kodlak of his curse. Win the civil war... okay, that one is pretty high-stakes. But it pales in comparison with the College questline, where you must literally save the world. *Again*, if you've done the main quest already.

IMO, it's quite something to have such high stakes for an optional questline. What if the Dragonborn weren't a wizard type and hadn't joined the College of Winterhold? Would Mundus be destroyed by Ancano almost immediately after being saved from Alduin? Would some other hero rise to the challenge? Or would the Eye of Magnus never emerge from Saarthal in the first place?

Not judging, one way or the other. I just think it's interesting that there's essentially a *side quest about saving the world*.",2020-01-04 07:05:45

She also away for a while and I ended up clearing an area alone because she decided to fuck off. But then I fast traveled and she magically appeared. 

Just now, I thought I'd check out Falkreath and I got caught stealing from Grave Concoctions and the woman started to fight me. I was ready to run but unbeknownst to me, I loaded Lydia with some loot, including two ""Staff of Sparks"". Well she equipped them both and is chasing this poor shop keeper around town just zapping her constantly. She even killed some other dude who got involved.

This is not the time for treachery, you fool, I'm thinking so I bail the fight and head to their hut to wait out the battle a bit. The dragon finishes off the bandits without taking much damage, and comes looking for me. He spews fire into the cabin, but I'm pretty safe and I continue to loot the place of potions and food, I'm firing arrows out the doors and windows and finally Faendal rocks up. He's feeling guilty and charges out with a battle axe but is soon down on a knee. Next I see a pack of ice wolves attacking the dragon and he's starting to look like easy pickings, so I take a leaf out of Faendal's book and wack the dragon over the snout twice with a battle axe and he's dead.",2020-01-04 12:54:58

These can be melted at the smelter and can be made into large amount of dwemer bows, make sure you have the warrior stone and have the well rested boost for more experience

Method 2: in a mine north of whiterun, there is a load of iron ore and the transmute spell, which turns iron into silver and silver into gold.

I am going to play on legendary difficulty without mods (only UI mods), console (apart from modifying appearance), glitches or bugs and trying to avoid too much cheese, although some may say just using smiting/alchemy/enchanting is cheesing.

Currently I decided to go with Nord wielding two handed sword and light armor (since it seems to have superior stamina regen/perks). I am aware Orcs are better for pure minmax, but I already minmaxed orc many years ago so I wanna try some other race this time and I never played Nord.

BUT I am not entirely sure if two handed sword is the best way to go. If most of the damage will come from enchantments, then probably faster attacking weapon would be way better? I still don't know if two handed weapons get any additional bonuses from stacking insane enchantments on them and I since last time I minmaxed was like 9 years ago, I am unsure how high can you go (I did not use glitches back then either). Either way two handed sword is definitely fun to play for me.

Second, we engage the next swarm of falmer. Brynjolf takes on a mage. After the falmer are dead, he says loudly ‘Hardly felt a thing’ with a massive ice spike through his skull.

And lastly, we come across a whirling trap (the ones that come up out of the ground). Karliah and I stay far away from it. After we pass, I hear a loud slice and SURE ENOUGH Brynjolf is on the ground after walking face first into it. I laugh and we continue on, only to hear it hit him down AGAIN and AGAIN.

However, it’s my favorite game of all time because the world in my opinion is by far the greatest world put into a video game. It’s got so much depth to it and is full of intrigue. The random events in the game allow for dynamic encounters whilst exploring and you create incredible moments in organic ways. It makes the fetch questing fun.

Maybe a mod that makes it so that unsheathing while in sneak mode stops your character temporarily, as to keep your movement speed from shifting. I'd be willing to see if I can't make the mod myself if it doesn't exist, but I'd like to know if one already does.

For context, [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ejzlqz/what_are_some_unique_skyrimthemed_proposal_ideas/) is the link to the other post just so you can see what has been suggested.

So far, these ideas have stood out to me:

* Inscribing the ring or another gift in Dovahzuul. The phrase in mind is ""I am yours, unending."" One translator showed that as ""Zu'u los hin, unahzaal.""
* Amulet of Mara, of course, has to come into play somehow.
* Saying something about the classic ""arrow in the knee"" as I kneel.
* Take three words from a favorite shout and hide them at 3 activities we'll do throughout the day. At the conclusion of each activity when she gets the word she'll also get a gift. The final gift would be the ring. These may also give clues to where the next location to find a shout will be.",2020-01-05 11:39:02

skyrim,2020,1,"Hey there! Recently I've decided to play Morrowind, Oblivion and Skyrim again. I've decided to make kind of a family throughout these games, the Harrriers. The Harriers are strong nords who favor two handed blades and heavy armor, and are known for being nice and charismatic, and value the traditional nord stereotype and have no racial hate whatsoever.

However.....

The Harriers are known for supporting the rulers of Tamriel in every case, but as of recently I've become quite hateful of the Altmers. Not so much in Morrowind, but any Oblivion and Skyrim player knows that it's extremely rare to find good altmer in both games. All of them are either blatantly rude or have evil second intentions.

The Harrriers are proud Talos worshippers, and the white gold concordat caused them to loose faith and friendship with the empire, but most of all, increase their hate for the thalmor or altmer in general. So the question is: should I make hate for the altmer a big element in my role play?

Hate for the thalmor roleplay will affect this in my oblivion campaign:
-I will not try to raise any disposition with Altmer people, unless I really need it for the quest.
-I will always try to show my hate for altmer in dialogue options.
-I will always try to avoid contact with Altmer in any way.
-I wont do any quest for Altmer (except for Umbacano, as his rewards are exceptional)
-If I feel like to, and if a altmer really annoys me, I will just kill him.
-I will not wear any piece of elven armor or weapons. 


And this for my skyrim campaign:
-All of the above.
-I will finish oblivion first, but when I start skyrim, my hate for the thalmor might lead me to join the Stormcloaks.


So, what's your opinion? Should I do it? Am I being a little bit extremist?",2020-01-05 14:10:51

Playing on XBO, after confronting Nepos’ the household attacked me upon exiting the house. I believe it glitched out as I suppose they were supposed to do it inside. Nonetheless, I kill them, get the journal yadda yadda. Go to the Shrine, get arrested as per usual. But, now every time the Orcish guard lets me into the mine I get attacked immediately upon exiting the gate door by EVERY prisoner. Any solutions?

Edit: I’ve seen all sorts of questions regarding this quest, but only one similar to my scenario, but that was answered with turning of the “Master of Disguise” mod that I do not have nor ever had implemented.

Edit 2: Upon looking through things I have noticed that I never got the “Read Nepos Journal” part of the quest and it just went right to “Return to Eltrys.”

Final Edit, I hope: REALLY HOPING FOR A SOLUTION AS I MADE A NOOB MISTAKE AND MISSED A CRUCIAL SAVE AND NOW CAN’T GO BACK FAR ENOUGH TO JUST START FROM BEFORE ENCOUNTERING NEPOS WITHOUT STARTING 100 HRS WORTH OF GAMEPLAY OVER!

First of all: Wth should i skill? RN I'm mostly playing with either sword and shield or sword and magic and i would like to keep it that way. Up to now i skilled One handed-combat, health and once stamina i think. Whats the ""best"" route to take and which equipment should i use?

Furthermore i have also looked into mods and currently have installed skyui and some kind of 2k HD (Most used on Nexusmods, but i couldn't see a difference). Would u advise me to install some other mods or just play the game as it is.

Thanks in advance to anybody responding/helping me :)",2020-01-06 09:39:17

So this is somewhat of a first time playing Skyrim and I chose High Elf since it has bonus magicka or somethinf. 1 hour into the game I haven't really started the main questions except get the golden claw. What I've done is the Waking Nightmare quest and just some exploration. Also, although a high elf I'm not really using destruction spells. 
I saw this [video](https://youtu.be/uGuTh06dKDM) and I think I want to go for this dual wield build now. However, I'm a high elf too. 
So all I wanted to know was should I restart my journey, or should I continue as high elf and keep building this build. I mean does being a high elf and dual wielder have any problem in the later game or something? And the reason I'm not really finding this mage stuff interesting is because it does not do good dmg, and the mana runs out pretty fast too so in the end I have to use weapons duh!
Also, is necromancer build good, be it main questline or side quests?

skyrim,2021,1,"So I just started a new playthrough. This time I'm not playing as the dragonborn right off the bat. I've just been wandering, haven't started the main quest, not leveling up, and exploring everywhere I can as I walk from hold capital to hold capital and I'm so stunned at the small detail I've been noticing that I never have before, as I usually play with the rush of the story and side quests driving me. For instance, I stopped by a certain nordic tomb (Can't remember the name) and I was greeted by a nord outside talking about a certain dark elf defiling his tomb and his family. During our conversation he said something along the lines of ""Him and his dirty dark elf magic!"" I'm currently playing as a dark elf, so to myself I thought geez man that's a bit racist. Seconds after I thought that, the dialogue he uttered made me laugh so hard, as he recognizes that I'm a dark elf and goes ""I'm sure you're not like that you seem nice"" or something along those lines. It was hilarious to me. I've been loving this so far, like the first time I played it  


Also, found another reason why Delphine is the worst. Out of every Inn I've stayed at (which has been most of them so far) She's the ONLY Innkeeper who doesn't show you to your room, doesn't even mention it.

skyrim,2021,1,"I’m trying to keep in mind that this game is almost 10 years old, so things are going to feel a bit dated and off. But I’ve barely started branching out into the world and I’m just getting frustrated. I’m playing SSE on PS4. Vanilla for my first playthrough.  My biggest frustrations are my followers, aiming, and just plain strange and clunky movement controls on anything but flat terrain. Maybe someone can offer me some advice on how to better deal with some of these things?

Followers are supposed to be helpful. But thus far, I find that even if I tell them to hang back, they completely dominate any fight I’m in. I try to sneak up and aim a couple arrows, and up runs my follower, hacking away and either getting in the way of my shots or killing everything before I can even orient myself. Or, they just end up getting completely lost if I go anywhere off a main path. I’ll look back and my follower is nowhere to be seen. Is leaving her behind for this first part of the game while I’m still getting used to things a good idea?

Aiming just feels really strange. Hit boxes don’t feel very tight, and I have a hard time even knowing if I’m in connecting range. A lot of my melee hits just end up hitting my follower because she’s all over the place. And I just cannot figure out how to properly aim with my bows. Even when I try to carefully line up the reticle, the shots don’t connect in ways I expect.

And the climbing up rocky terrain is a nightmare. Half the time I can’t jump over the smallest of rocks or ledges. Tonight, I tried climbing on a rock near a corner to jump to a ledge. My character slid back for no apparent reason, and I couldn’t jump back out even though I appeared to be standing still and upright. I could turn 360° but I was completely stuck. So I had to restart the dungeon from scratch. It was very demoralizing.

Is this just part of the experience? I know people have invested hundreds of hours into this game, so if these are just common growing pains, that’d be nice to hear.

**Edit:** Wow, what a helpful community! Thanks for the great info. This reminds me of the reddit Dark Souls community because you all actually recognize the ways the game is fucked up, but can give advice on how to enjoy it. 😊",2021-01-01 06:13:36

skyrim,2021,1,"A few days ago I posted the question ""Why are Argonians Thieves"".  I wanted to know why Argonians in Skyrim were set up with skill bonuses that indicated that they were thieves when the history of Black Marsh didn't indicate any indications of that sort of behavior, unlike Bosmer or Khajit. Some people came back with pretty good explanations as to why but it wasn't until I started playing one that it started to make sense.

Argonians don't give a damn about Skyrim. They are the ultimate outsiders.

There's absolutely nothing about the province that would give them the slightest inclination to care about anyone there. Their god The Hist is so alien that it's the only representation is a tree that makes a purple syrup. So religious fervor isn't an option. Every Argonian you meet is either a thief, a junkie, involved with organized crime or pathetically trying to assimilate into a culture that can't view them as anything more than some kind of monster that happens to talk.  

There's no one to fall in love with. No reason to make a life there at all.

I'm genuinely having trouble finding any reason to join the Dawnguard.  Who gives a damn if Nords are getting killed? 

It's good writing on the part of Skyrim's creators. I wonder if it was an accident or by design?",2021-01-01 16:47:32

Realistic water

skyrim,2021,1,"Hello everybody.   
Skyrim is a game I always fought of as one game I would never play. I never watched any videos of it but I know the memes like ""Illusion 100"" and the others. But to my surprise I recently got the game for the switch and I want to write my adventure down so I can come back and see what I went through. I also want to share it here on Reddit, so that you can laugh about my fails. Maybe some veteran players will read this and remember how it was to play the game for the first time. So let's start with what I achieved until now. Have fun. (I'm German so I am sorry for all spelling or grammar mistakes but I will try to use a translator to minimize it.)

""You are finally awake."" I started the game not really knowing what I am going to do. The first few minutes of world building were really interesting and I thought it would just be an ""join us, the rebells, we are the good ones and help us save Skyrim"" game but oh boy was I wrong. When I got to make my character I was very unsure how I wanted to play the game. I saw all the different folks and understood their specific talents. So my first problem was what was I going to be? A tanky Hp monster? A wizard of destruction? A Sailsman? I played Assassins Creed recently so I thought ""Why not use my sneak experience and become a Khajiit?"" So now I am a big black cat going by the name Dominik with no idea what to do. My next problem didn't wait long to show itself. Follow the rebel guy or follow this military officer(?). I didn't want to betray the guy who just told me to jump out of a window into a burning house and press against a wall to survive a dragon (who looked really badass while putting everything on fire) so I followed him. After learning I could steal from dead bodies and killing some more I now knew I wanted to get rich by becoming a thief (not my best idea for my first run but whatever). I did some talking and stealing from dead bodies and some unsupervised furniture but didn't really feel like becoming a rebel. It's nice being able to say ""I will save the kingdom"" but being chaotic neutral sounds more fun. So after getting some first gear from Helgen and Riverforest (is that the correct English name?) I went to the first ""big"" city Whiterun. I stole some more stuff, got some new quests and found a crystal, which I have to show to an appraiser. I didn't want to get involved into this clan battle so I left pretty quickly the city and scouted the area. Now equipped with a heavy armor and a big two-hand hammer I could g..... wait a minute what is this armor and weapon? I realized I kinda lost track of my career and became a little tanky with three level points already in hp. For the moment I gave up on becoming a thief and went to a bandit hideout (Greymoor) where I suspected the bandit from my bounty hunt from Whiterun to be. I killed the three guards outside, leveling my shooting skills and getting more loot from the three dead guys. And I went in. The first dungeon. I saw a enemy and.... run away after I died four times to him without even getting half of  his Hp. Not a good start but at least I got the loot from the other three guards. I had a quest hint to join the bard academy so I went north heading Solitude. On my way other the mountains I killed some guys (of course looted them), ran away from some border guards, sneaked by the Skyborn Altar and finally reached Morthal.  
A nice city with some nice easy quest I could do before going on to Solitude. Easy- NO. I hate this quest. Laid to rest. I hate it. After doing almost everything before going to Solitude I picked up this quest. I felt sad for the girl so this was the first quest I wanted to finish. I found the girl and the woman, killed her easily because of my now higher level and better gear but then the struggle began. ""Get into Alvas home."" You all know how hard it is to break into somebody's home without knowing that you can steal their keys? It took me seven tries breaking in because there was always some guard. Oh and some guys who wanted to kill me without any reasons. Yeah. After learning how to learn a spell I had in my inventory for so long and killing the three guys one by one I found out they were hired killers (because the papersname was contact so I made a conclusion, hey nobody said you could open papers). And I promise you the moment I find the person who hired them he is dead. After finally breaking in, killing Alva and the now double widowed man whose name I forgot because I choosed the wrong time to break in, I found the diary and was ready to kill some more vampires with a six head ""army"". But five of them left at the entrance. So I told the last guy to follow me.   
Thonnir. I will never be able to forget him. Killing some unsuspecting vampires with new learnd magic no problem. But this master vampire. He was to strong for me even  after many tries with different strategies. I gave up. I wanted to go and leave the city. And who left with me? THONNIR. After killing all the lower vampires alone I forgot him. But I remembered. He was useless. I tried to be sneaky in the cave? Thonnir walks in with his lantern. I wanted to fight the vampire master? Thonnir was a insta kill. He was u-s-e-l-e-s-s. I told him to wait for me. I went and stopped at some shrine onmy way to Solitude. Who comes up behind me? T-h-o-n-n-i-r. This guy followed me after I told him to wait! I could always outrun him (after looking in the settings and learning how to run faster) and easily reached Solitude. After some real life sleep I decided to become a real thief. I sold my heavy armor and weapons, bought new light armor and a little shield with a steal dagger. At this point I also had some magic enhancing armor which I keep for panic magic moments. Equipped with new gear it was time to steal. After some fast steals I met Jaree-Ra. A nice guy who wanted to work with me to steal a lot of things. What would you expect? A Khajiit stealing together with a other Khajiit. I was sure this was my first step to world wide ""know"" master thief. I needed some more money for a potion so I went to steal again while doing some little mini quests.  
You all remember tHoNNiR? This time this guy could keep up with my smooth movements to steal from some awake people. He saw what I did. And he was not happy. You know after always paying the prize of some gold coins to stay free I thought 465 gold coins was not worth it and I went into jail. After sleeping I got out and who waited for me? rinnohT. He was just like:""Hey buddy. Because you don't killed the master vampire yet I will follow you everywhere and never leave you."" And I can you one thing. Being a thief with a noble stalker is not possible. Everytime I stole something it was jail time. I even tried to kill him but he is just immortal. I read in the help manual that after three days in jail your group would leave you so I made as much chaos as possible. I set everybody I saw on fire or attacked him with my dagger and got into jail. Funny thing. After waiting (using + on the switch controller) for FIVE DAYS before sleeping and getting free again who was there? Who could possibly wait FIVE Days even though the help manual says it takes THREE days for your company to leave? T H O N N I R. I had enough. I went back to Movarths Cave, set the settings to Novice killed him with some arrow headshot, completed the quest and finally. FINALLY I was free. No more Thonnir. I could be a thief again. (This took me two and a half real time hours)  
Being back in Solitude I scouted the blue palace, stole some things, learned about alchemy and enchanting by using the tables in the palace, got a new quest to go to a cave and it was now time for my quest.  
You could think being a thief is easy. Just put out the unguarded (I don't know why it was unguarded) fire on the tower, talk to the guy again and go looting. Some people would say it's suspicious that the ship is already looted. And that there were many people with full armor sets even though the plan was to act like the saviors of the ship crew. And that maybe going into the deepest part into the ship for a meeting is not the best place when there is a foot deep water everywhere. So after getting my first betrayel in the game I slaughtered with my (thanks to this one magic woman in the blue palace) leveled up magic combination of fire and electricity and killed everyone so I could loot them. And I learned how to open letters. (Now I also know the name of the hired killers. You are dead Mallus Maccius!) I looted a new and better bow and went to the cave from the note to get revenge. With the combination of my level 30 stealth, level 25 shooting skills, my now leveled up magicka and a underwater breathing amulett I made in the blue palace I took them down one by one got the loot. It's pretty easy to flee a fist fight when you can hide underwater without drowning. Also I learned some new enchantings from stolen armor and sold the rest.  
I now am level 8, have a light and heavy armor (just in case I want to go big hammer style) and a magic outfit for panic magic moments. I also have many potions from my ""house visits"" and 97 Lockpicks. I just need to find somebody who is willing to buy my stolen goods. I also have some quests like ""Bleak Falls Barrow"" and ""The mind of madness"" (which I have no idea how to do the first part). Currently I am standing at the entrace of the Wolfskull Cave for the ""The man who cried wolf"" quest.

skyrim,2021,1,"Adopting a kid in this game had a lot of potential, and I think it was squandered. All you can really do is tell them to go to bed, tell them to do chores, accept a gift from them, and let them have a pet. This does not properly take advantage of any real life parallels to raising a child.

It would've been really cool if your child, say, asked if you can track down something that belonged to their birth parents and return it to them, so they can keep a little reminder of them in their room or something. Alesan's father, for example, was a sailor. It would've been a really neat little quest if he asked you to track down his old captain's log or something.

Maybe your child gets a rare illness and you have to find a mage that can help you find the ingredients to make the cure. 

There are a lot of other little things the game could've implemented into adoption as well. Maybe you can use one of the books you picked up during your travels to read your child a bedtime story, and depending on their likes and dislikes, they can make a comment like ""that was really cool, I liked the part about the Dragon Priests"", or ""sorry pa, that was really boring. Maybe you can read me a war story next time, I love those"".

Your kid can make comments on the city you live in as well, and maybe make suggestions to live in another hold. For example, if you live in Riften, your kid can say ""I hate this place, I see people get robbed every night, and the orphanage reminds me of when I was an orphan"". The Dragonborn can then have a few dialogue options: ""I'm sorry (kid's name), but this is all that we can afford. We have to make do"", ""I know, I was planning on moving to a different hold soon"", or even ""It's not all bad. Maybe you just need an outlet. The Temple of Mara might be a comforting escape"".

I can understand doing this if you're in the process of building up your character, but, once you've maxed out smithing, alchemy, and enchanting (you're an idiot if you don't focus on all three if you're doing a combat build), there's no reason not to go with full dragon scale for light armor or Daedric for heavy. The protection is unbeatable. The only reason I can think of is that people like to role-play with their character and wear armor that they would wear if they were physically in the game world. Me, I go for the strongest armor possible which, to my knowledge, is only achieved by smithing your own pieces augmented with smithing potions and gear enchanted with smithing bonuses. Plus, you can get the skill tree perk that gives you a bonus for matching set.

Or maybe there is an objective reason to wear exotic, themed armor? Curious to know.",2021-01-02 01:53:09

Race: any human(i did a Redguard for stamina regen and OH skill)

Skill tree: alterations, one hand, block and little bit of restoration and smithing

My gears are a cultist rob some random boots and an Amulet of Talos. I use a blade sword for the katana shape and the fact that its not enchanted.

Shouts: cyclone, elemental fury, whirlwind Sprint and dragon aspect (just because its so cool and powerful)

Spells: ebony flesh, whirlwind cloak and fast healing (if getting into trouble) 

Stone: Atronach stone

Ok so i got 80% spell absorption from alteration and the stone and 300 armor from the ebony flesh and mage armor. 

For combat i cast my armor and cloak and then i charge with my blade sword upgraded and use my shouts as i see fits.

For role play i have no followers. I always keep a flute and i search fights wherever i can.

The backstory for this character was that she was not born a dunmer, but a chimer, 5000 years before the events of skyrim, using some kind of time-altering magic, she was able to be essentially  immortal. 

All that makes sence, from a lore perspective, but I'm wondering if the next part does.

The first half of her life, she served as a protector of the dragon priests, having moved away from morrowind, she was loyal to the dragons, more then some of the priests. 

She was, to an extent friends with some of the most powerfull men in skyrim. 

She had conversed with, krosis, volsung, valok the jailer, and... the wearer if the konahrik mask.

The identity of konahrik, she swore to take to her grave. 

But, konahrik vanished soon after she learned if there identity.

Over time, the dragon cult started too crumble under it's own weight, wit politics and infighting constantly being a problem.

Then the dragon war started, and yet she remained loyal, and willing to give her life for the cult. 
 
But, soon the cult fell, and she had no choice but to flee. 

But to where? Well... forelhost stronghold, under the control of ragot and his last group of resistance.

When forlhost was seized, and ragot ordered a mass suicide, she left, for oblivion, to have some safety. 

She went quiet for 3000 years, until today, when she learned of her destiny to kill alduin, she was hesitant, but went through with it, killing her former master.  

After the death if alduin, she saw the horrifying things done by the cult, and made a vowel, to purge all of the priests from skyrim.

skyrim,2021,1,"Okay so,

I bought the game last week and I have been enjoying it so far. I think I played for 15 hours or so. I picked a North and I wanted to play as a sneaky thief/assassin. 

I upgraded my Sneak skill quite a bit, (got asassins blade). Also got some in Lockpicking, One-handed and Light Armor.

I was doing a quest for the Companions, I was sneaking and came across three people guarding an entrance. Some of them I could beat easily but some it seemed like I did almost no damage. So after trying and dying a few times I managed to beat them but was out of Healing Potions ect.

There were a lot more bandits in the cave and I only managed to kill them because I lured them into their own traps (swinging fence with spikes). Even when I did sneak damage I could not manage to kill them.

I died quite a few times and it became very frustrating. It seemed like a simple quest but it took me ages. I thought I messed up my skilltree (put some points in two-handed). 

I started a new game and followed a guide for a OP Assassin but I feel like I’m ‘cheating’ the game and not getting the full experience.

What should I do?
- Lower the difficulty 
- Start all over
- Or invest points in other skills?

I have an Orc at lvl 35 with Ebony armor (chest, hands, feet, along with Otar's mask for the head piece, all improved) with a total AR of 740. I know that's above the armor cap (567 w/o shield). I have Heavy Armor at lvl 85, but only 3/5 points in Juggernaut and the point in Well Fitted. I have Smithing currently at 95 in Heavy Armor along with Arcane Smithing. I got to the level cap just with Smithing, Fortify Smithing enchantments, and regular Smithing potions. No ""cheats"", in other words.

Since I'm at the armor cap with not the greatest armor (but looks good!), is there really any good reason to finish up the final two points in Juggernaut? Would it not be a waste to put those points there when maybe there are other more reasonable perks to take elsewhere in another skill tree?

But I'm willing to listen so long as no one uses that ""Stormcloaks are racist "" crap that everyone always gives as an answer. I want legitimate, detailed reasons for joining the Imperials.

:edit: These are all great points thanks! I've decided this new character is on the side of the Imperials, though my other character, a Redguard girl from Hammerfell, is still with the Stormcloaks. She's not too happy with the fact that the Empire turned their backs on Hammerfell and neither am I. They shouldn't have just turned their backs on their allies like that.

Here I will list everything that happens in the quest

Guests won't sit until I move galmar

After negotiating and everyone agreeing only ulfric and galmar will leave and everyone else stays in their seats doing nothing I get the fallen quest on my journal which tells me to ask greybeards for help with the negotiations but all of the angir options does nothing and talking to esbern tells me to kill parthunax? Wtf

OH yeah and autosaving after the negotiations causes the game to crash so I'm literally in a loop
. Anyone got an idea what to do

Maybe there's a mod
Or a console command that skips the quest entirely

Both are farm owners. Both are rich and look down on others. But the only thing Nazeem is doing wrong is destroying his marriage and trying to gain influence by sucking Jarl ass. 

Olfrid is actively engaged with the thieves guild. Olfrid aided the cover up of Thorald Gray-Mane's disappearance, and lied to his greiving mother about it. Olfrid is gaining influence at the expense of Whiterun's citizens, whike lining his own pockets. Olfrid is a dick.

Started Skyrim a few weeks ago, and i had a ton of problems and a hard time playing/understanding The game. Now i will start a new game but before i did that, i wanted to ask a few questions. Both about Skyrim and Bethesda RPG's. Some important info:

-No Spoilers Please

-I Don't Want To Use Any Mods

-If You Think I Should Find A Question's Answer On My Own While Playing The Game, Feel Free To Not Answer That and Let Me Know. 

-I Watched A Video and It Said Things Like ""Go Here To Grab This Strong Weapon"" I Don't Want To Do Things Like That, I Want It To Be As Realistic As Possible

Now, here are my questions:

1-)I Can Steal, Everything? Will That Make Me A Bad Person(In The Game World, Like An Honor System)? Will It Block Some Quests? 

2-)I Can Get Everything?(Plates, Forks, Blank Pages) Should I? Is Inventory A Big Problem?

3-)In The RPG's I Played, Locations Were Marked With A Question Mark? Is There Something Like That Here? Or Do I Have To Look At My Compass To See Undiscovered Locations?

4-)Should I Go And Explore The Locations Or Go For The Quests?

5-)I Followed One of The 2 Characters Until The Nearby Town. And That Quest Just, Ended? Follow Them To Their House, Nothing Happened. Found A Side Quest In A Bar. But It Was Just, Random. Again, In The RPG's I Played, Available Quests Had A ""!"" How Will I Find Side Quests In This Game?

6-)There Are A Lot of Books, Should I Read All of Them? Are They Important For The Main Story?

7-)Main Quests Or Side Quests First? Personally I Like To Go To A Main Mission, Do The Side Quests Around That Main Mission, Then Do That Main Mission and Go To The Next Main Mission Area To Do The Same Process Again. But I Heard A Lot of People Say I Played Side Quests For 50 Hours Before Main Quests. Is That A Good Thing To Do or A Bad Thing?

8-)Any Other Tips You Would Like To Give? Thanks For Reading All of It.",2021-01-03 06:22:31

skyrim,2021,1,"The last time I seriously played Skyrim was just after Dawnguard came out.  I picked it up a few times after that but got caught in the modding cycle for hours upon hours and then burning out on actually playing the game.  However this time I've successfully curtailed my need to find a perfect modded setup and am actually playing the game.

The problem I'm now facing is that I suck.  Like hard.  Which is fine, most games I have no problems putting the difficult down lower and just enjoying the experience.  But for some god awful reason I'm actually doing what I can to bump up the difficulty and try to get better.  However I'm still falling back on the crutch of followers and abusing the power of sneak.  I've already installed a couple of the combat and gameplay overhuals to force myself out of that (like AGO, Blade &amp; Blunt, Realistic AI Detection and I'm trying different perk trees).  And surprisingly enough, still feeling like I want to keep pushing myself to get better while playing.

Onto my actual question, reading tips and trying things out only goes so far for me, I'd like to actually see if I could find some players who've done playthroughs of Skyrim using characters and/or mods that don't depend upon followers and the default sneak mechanics at a high difficult, so I can get a better idea of what I can do to be better.  I'm hoping someone here can recommend some videos to watch to that effect, so I can watch how someone else conquers a quest/dungeon in ways I hadn't thought of or shows off better resource management and how to prepare for them.

Joined the imperial legion and alternated civil war missions and DB missions. Changing for a regular townsfolk outfit before entering the db sanctuary, so the DB never figure i'm an imperial.

Civil war missions titles given by Tullius become go-to's to change armor (steel imperial&gt;Solitude guard&gt;Tulius armor&gt;imperial dragon). 

The rp goal of that character is to gain the trust of imperial troops through actions on the battlefield, while working to kill Mede II in the shadows, AND become the DB leader. This and Mautierre's help will serve getting appointed Emperor (again, probably lore breaking since i don't know what that council mautierre is part of can do about it. Nvm)

skyrim,2021,1,"Tl:dr at the bottom lol

Hey everyone, it's been a bit since I've played skyrim because I had a 6 year old laptop that took 15 minutes just to open chrome. I just bought myself a nice new gaming laptop and decided to I was going to try and get all the achievements (I left it at 75%) and also do some quests I never finished.

One of them was ""A Return to Your Roots"" where you have to find 30 crimson nirnroot in blackreach. That place creeped me out when I first played, so I booked it out of there after picking up the nirnroots that were easiest to access.

Now, I'm going through trying to find 30 of them. I didn't feel like running around blindly, so I looked up a map...but half of them aren't at the marked locations. It's driving me insane. I've looped the outside of the map 3 times and run the interior even more. I've gone by the water, followed the chimes, everything. I even used a few console codes so I could fly around and get a better view. Even when the chimes are SUPER loud, I can't find the nirnroot. Despite literally flying around. 

Anyone experience anything like this? Everyone from 4-6 years ago said it was super easy, but I just ran around for 2 hours and only found 23 of them.

Tl;dr: looked up crimson nirnroot locations and can't find half of them despite listening for the chimes and everything. Any advice?",2021-01-03 08:32:43

I ended up reloading my save from before I got the perk. Luckily for me, I use two alternating save slots at a time, just in case some tomfuckery goes down exactly like this did. )
------------------
I just got the perk ""Quick Reflexes"", which slows down time if an enemy is power attacking while I'm blocking, right? First time I used it, it worked perfectly. But it never... stopped working. Permanent time slow. I could move around and look side to side just fine, but all enemies were in permanent time slow and me looking up or down took forever. Went and killed all three keepers (cause I'm in the soul cairn) with ease in this state. Saving and reloading didn't fix it, but saving and rebooting the game did.

Is this something I'll have to worry about in the future? I don't want to have to constantly reboot the game to undo time slow mode, and I'd rather just reload my save before I got that perk and avoid it if that's the case.",2021-01-03 10:20:50

skyrim,2021,1,"I know this has been asked many times before, but I can’t seem to find a convincing answer to this. I’m trying to figure out a way to stop Serana from raising the dead. Probably her AoE spells too, to prevent infighting between followers. I’d be grateful for any help. 

Is it possible to remove spells with console commands? I don’t want to start learning to use Creation Kit or anything like that. I’m halfway through my first ever playthrough, but I’ve been slowly adding mods along the way every time I’ve run into something that I felt could use some tweaking. 

I installed a mod (Queen of the Damned) that is supposed to, among other things,  replace Serana’s Necromancy with a summon Gargoyle spell... and it does indeed add that spell. But she still raises all the dead deer, mudcrabs, skeevers, bunnies and whatnot she comes across, ruins my stealth and leaves steaming ash piles all over the place. I hate that. And I don’t really care for the gargoyle either. In fact, the less Serana does, the better for me. I let her (and usually a rotating cast of 1-2 others) tag along for companionship purposes, I don’t really need their help in combat and prefer that they hang back and don’t get in the way (of my stealth archery). 😆

Is there a way to permanently remove spells from an NPC via console commands? I’d like to remove all of Serana’s summon spells. How do I find the correct spell IDs? Will the changes reset if she levels up?

If that can’t be done, I might also consider changing her class from Vampire to something like a Nightblade or anything that doesn’t have any Conjuration skill. Would that do the trick? 

Do you see any risk of breaking the Dawnguard questline (or the whole game) if I mess with this? 😬",2021-01-03 17:24:41

Background: I’ve only been playing Skyrim for like 6 months. I only had the dark elf playthrough (with like ~180 hours) until just recently I decided I wanted to do a legendary run (sneak archer build). 
When I game, I’m very goal oriented. I like to progress my characters and advance through the game, etc. Very rarely do I open up a game just to screw around in it and not make progress. 
Anyways, now that I have a legendary character, I almost question the point of advancing my lvl 33 character because I’m just going to do it all over again with my new character.

My Playthrough: No fast traveling, no mods. I usually stick to roads, but occasionally cut across country to change things up. Had a random in counter with the guy collecting on the bet, but messed up what I wanted to do and reloaded the save out of Whiterun. Both times, I dropped down to the stables, and ran cross country to the T-intersection heading East. Just pst the same area as the first random encounter, I found a second. This one was a dead Bandit Marauder and a horse which was tagged “Ride” not “Steal”. So, I climbed above the free horse (damn thing immediately tried abandoning me every time I got off), and beelined it to the dungeon. I dropped down no serious cliffs, pretty much sticking to the road until getting to the marshes. I dismounted to take on three groups of random enemies, finally arriving at the Ansilvund without ever seeing Aela. Completed the dungeon, no Aela. Returned to Whiterun, no Aela.

I have tried punching a guard and getting arrested. (Windhelm, Escaped)
I have tried waiting an hour.
I have tried waiting three days in my house. (Breezehome) 
I have run through the entire dungeon, and waiting for a day at the final chest.

skyrim,2021,1,"I’ve been playing Skyrim for years, originally through the Legendary Edition then through the Special Edition, and had never played all the way through the Vampire questline until recently. Only far enough to unlock the Vampire Lord power and unlock all the perks for an achievement.

The journey was underwhelming to me. I was hoping Harkon would lead a charge against the Dawnguard, at the very least, to take over their fort and set up a new base for Clan Volkihar. Maybe even have Serana turn against us and force a confrontation with her, then use her blood to blot out the sun with Auriel’s Bow. The stuff Harkon was building up to the entire time.

At least if I side with the Dawnguard, it feels like I’m building up a team and readying them to put an end to the vampiric shenanigans. Siding with the vampires doesn’t really build up to anything other than just killing Harkon just like the Dawnguard would have me do, only Serana ends up becoming their leader and not really changing anything else. The main story of that part of the expansion just really fell flat for me. Maybe I’m just biased because I’m not a fan of vampires in general.

Or maybe I’m missing something? Were there interesting quests for Harkon’s underlings I missed? Please let me know.",2021-01-04 06:52:49

I just purchased Skyrim on my switch. Please don't reprimand me for my choice in console... I have chronic illnesses that have been preventing me from playing my PS4 lately, my switch was the easier option for me to enjoy the game. 

I'm posting in regards to any tips, links to accurate and helpful guides, etc. You may have for a noob like myself 🥰 I played this game for the first time years ago, but I was at least 13 years old at the time, and didn't get far. 

Since the pandemic, I wanted a way I could keep myself busy and spend long distance quality time with my cousin. Despite moving from my hometown in TX, to Florida, I've been quarantined since the outbreak, due to being high risk. I miss my family terribly, especially my cousin, who I'm extremely close with and was just beginning to rekindle a relationship with before I was forced to move. So, I purchased Skyrim to have something he and I can play ""together"" (I'm aware there's no co-op) as well as have something to talk about.

I want to make the best out of my very first playthrough, I just chose the Mage route, on a Breton build, and have just left the caves and am en route my first village, Riverwood, I believe it's called, following the companion I escaped the dragon and my execution with. 

I really would appreciate any and all help, and hope all of you are continuing to stay safe in these crazy times ❤ Let's hope this new year erases everything that was... The-Year-That-Shall-Not-Be-Named, and fills us with new adventures and stories to come.

skyrim,2021,1,"A few months ago I began my first ever Skyrim playthrough, I escaped Helgen and went with Ralof to Riverwood. I played until the point where you give Farengar the dragonstone, and then no one showed up. Irileth never came into the room and I never got dragon rising, so I figured after talking to everyone in Dragonsreach that the main quest would start up eventually as I explored.

So I set off for the next 3 months exploring Skyrim, I ended up exploring every single place that I could and finishing almost every quest I got (I never left Skyrim for Solstheim, and I didn't finish the vampire questline). And then I decided that I should probably get back to the main quest, only to realise that I didn't have one. 

After some googling I finally found out that the game must have glitched all those months and hundreds of played hours ago. So i turned to the unstable and broken Skyrim commands. I entered every command that Google told me to put in, and eventually one of them worked... After exploring the whole map and almost emptying my journal I had begun the 4th main quest that I never knew existed.

skyrim,2021,1,"Little ""Adventure"" I had the other day where nothing went to plan...

To preface this, I always grind out the crafting skills early on so in the mid game I end up being really underpowered for my level as I haven't actually made good gear and potions and for a level 25 or something I have less than 30 in both light armour and destruction.  Also I'm playing on master so it's pretty unforgiving (not quite legendary tho.)

I'm heading off to fill some soul gems so Lydia and I decide to head to silver moon camp (the one with the lunar forge in Whiterun plains) to kill some bandits.  I'm a spell sword with light armour.  When I arrive there are the usual bandits outside who are tough to kill in my underleveled state. Nevertheless Lydia and I soldier through taking them all out, when we reach the top we meet our first obstacle: a Bandit Highwayman.  He shouts something agressive, whips out a shock spell and takes away 80% of my health and all of my magicka....oh dear.... 

Being the coward that I am, I turn and run away and just as I exit I see another red dot on the radar.  Then I hear the dragon roar as it circles above.  I jump down to the west, behind the wall to hide and who is there to greet me... a cave bear roars as it stands up on it's hind legs.  I run away once more, greeted by the sight of yet another red dot on the radar.  I jump onto the east side to hide from the bear, the dragon and the bandit where I see Lydia already engaged in a fight with two hostiles......a giant and a sabre cat......great.  Lydia gets smacked..... a lot and I'm to much of a wuss to help so look for somewhere else to hide.

At this point I remember I am a Breton and also a werewolf.  I chug a magicka potion, use stoneflesh, dragonskin and beast form (I have no perks in the werewolf tree so am weaker as a beast) and book it out of there as fast as my doggy legs can carry me spells and dragon breath flying all around.  At this point I realise I'm an idiot and ran in the direction of the giants' camp to the south and as I see 3 mammoths charging towards me the dragon lands as well.  I proceed to get one shot by a giant, take a trip to space and respawn outside the bandit camp ready to try again..... I don't try again.

skyrim,2021,1,"I've done a quick search but it's looking like there's an issue with my game instead of this being a part of the game. 

I've read my first elder scroll and defeated Alduin at the throat of the world. The game lore says that reading the scrolls affects your vision, but it seems like online people say it only causes blindness for a few seconds to the dragonborn, then everything is normal. However, when I've played after reading the scroll, in most locations the colors of the surroundings are washed out and muted, and things in the distance seem to blur more than they used to. I've tried fast travelling around to a few outdoor locations and they all seem foggy like this, and the indoor locations I've been in are very monotone yellow or grey. Is there something wrong with my game/settings or does the game change after you read the elder scroll?",2021-01-04 21:47:53

I like Vigor's poise, stamina and conditional damage. I really like that movement and such things actually have meaning to damage.

Like, you can't regenerate stamina if you're jogging, wich is obnoxious. 

Smilodon is very nice too, because it increases damage, making fights faster. It also has a somehow similiar stamina system but it's not as frustrating as Vigor's. It also has consequences for losing stamina, wich I like.

I recently decided to start skyrim and remembered how much I love Skyrim. I looked online to see what I can buy to represent Elder Scrolls in my game room but was kinda disappointed at the available figurines and merchandise. Anyone know of any figurines,  statues or anything cool to represent the franchise? I didn't buy the shrines a while back because I didn't think I'd be impressed and that's a lot of space for 9 shrines and I'd rather an imperial or nord figurine.

In Neon Genesis Evangelion, all of humanity is wiped out during a climactic battle because a group called SEELE attempted to transfer all of humanities souls into a giant robot to achieve immortality.

The Dwemer used to live primarily in giant underground fortress cities, build around and inside cavernous underground spaces. In Skyrim, there is a particularly large cavern that houses such a ruin.

In Neon Genesis Evangelion, the main characters live primarily in a fortress city called Tokyo-3, which can sink beneath the earth to protect itself. The city descends into a massive underground cavern called the GeoFront.

In TES, the Dwemer had access to a Elder ~Scroll~, which they drew vast amounts of knowledge from. This scroll is a ancient artifact that contains a ever-changing record of both the past as well as possible futures. One such future foretold by the Scrolls is the return of Alduin, and the end of the world.

In NGE, SEELE possess a ancient artifact; an alien instruction book known as the Dead Sea ~Scrolls~, which predicts the future chain of events that will lead to the end of the world.

The Dwemer are TES!SEELE.

skyrim,2021,1,"I've always been interested in time loop stories and since i can't play majora's mask with textures that don't look like early 2000s unless i buy a remake that ruined all the stuff i was excited about, i have no other game than modded skyrim special edition.

I have the end times mod which i plan to set the end of nirn to 14 days and make a save right after finishing helgan. This should give me about 5.6 hours to defeat alduin but make it nearly impossible for me without spending most of that time grinding exp and increasing my skills after leveling up. I have a mod that increases Alcuin's strength and with this small amount of time I'll be unable to reach a high level and have to fight him at level 20 or 30 maximum.

I use uncapper so i don't gain much hp when leveling up at lower levels and i have it take 200 +(playerlevel*100) as my needed xp to level up. I also use the mod experience so skyrim has a classic rpg leveling system

skyrim,2021,1,"I’m really confused about what this game expects out of me. Is it normal to have to suddenly and unexpectedly adjust difficulty levels?

I’m playing as a thief build. Trying to rely on stealth as best I could, but I do recognize I’m going to have to do some melee combat. Haven’t really had any issues leading up to this point. Haven’t been intentionally grinding. Just doing what the game is throwing at me. Most of my levels came from stealth, smithing and archery.

So I reach the area during Proving Honor where there are two swordsmen and an archer, right before the final room....and I cannot stay alive for shit. Even Farkas goes down rather quickly. (Granted, I’m still getting used to this game’s absolutely nonsensical hitboxes and movement mechanics, but that’s a different issue.) Nothing I’m trying works. So I lower the difficulty down, and suddenly Farkas is one-shotting everyone before I can even make it there.

I don’t understand. Did I level incorrectly? I’ve heard there’s enemy scaling, which makes this situation *really* not make sense. I feel like if I wait a few levels, the enemies are just gonna get harder, right?

I want to enjoy this game and I want a challenge, but I just feel like something very basic is going over my head and it’s making me feel stupid. 😕",2021-01-05 09:54:14

skyrim,2021,1,"So... I bought Skyrim for the third time in my life to give it one final playthrew before I put it behind me forever, this time for the Nintendo Switch. 

Within the past 9 and a half days, i have dropped 85 hours so far, strictly on Legendary difficulty and no cross hair, and to be honest, I feel like it's missing something. I'm just not getting the feeling the fulfillment i was hoping for so I could move on with my gaming life. So I've decided I'm going set the bar to the highest possible standard of survival/adventure gaming, while capturing all the best moments with the Nintendo Switches Capture Button.

To start, I noted what i thought would make the game more challenging, immersive, and emotionally fulfilling. Upon completion of the rules i asked Google as a joke what I could do to make Skyrim More challenging, and she guided me strait here where i began to instantly weigh my ideas with everyone here's. With all of our ideas combined I believe i have concocted a perfect set of guidelines to follow on one's Skyrim players to truly immerse, challenge, and fulfill the player. 

(Survival Mode)

Game Setting Rules.

1=legendary difficulty
2=no cross hair
3=no floating quest markers
4=opacity to 0
5=all saves but rest disabled

World Rules.

1=no fast travel, except carriages
2=no passing time
3=may only use equipment bought, found, or stolen- (exception) no hidden Khajiit chests
4=only one use of The Voice per save
5= no companions

Character Rules.

1= may improve only one of the 3 crafting skills
2= may improve up to 1/3 of all skills, that's 6 at most
3= no vampires/werewolfs

Story Playthrew Rules.

1= must complete the civil war questline as either a Stormcloak or the Empire
2= must complete the Dragon Born story line
3= may only be part of and quest for one faction at a time.
4= must complete every side quest given to you along the way.

My Personal Playthrew Rules.

1=since I'm play on the Nintendo Switch, must have Motion Controls/Gesture Attacks on at all times.

I hope I've inspired you all to give it your best. Thank you for your attention. Questions? Comments? Please ask! Happy gaming.

I have a rather random, vague question for you all. Hopefully you can help me figure out the name of this cave, that or I dreamt this place up haha..

I have a mental picture in my mind of a cavern where you go down this somewhat narrow pathway, and it seems like it was almost a spiral staircase-like (note, there may not have actually been stairs, more like sloped rock) type of level. But it was open to light at the top. I remember it being somewhat lush and maybe there was a waterfall or river like feature towards the bottom? It also felt really big and ""grand"". I also want to say you fight skeletons in this area, but I can't remember..

I want to say it was not snowy, but maybe. And it would have been brighter grey rock? Not that dark brown cave rock. But who knows... Ugh haha

skyrim,2022,1,"So I just started playing modded and I am playing with the apocalypse magic of skyrim mod. Now I've seen that it adds some cool spells into the game however there appears to be a problem where the spells sort of just don't happen, they consume the magicka and then it just stops casting, sometimes it only consumes half magicka and then stops charging. It's like a 1/10 chance for it to actually work it seems. Could this be because of some other conflicting mods or is this an error in the mod itself? It also happens to spells that aren't from apocalypse. When casting sparks it sometimes just randomly stops for some reason, same with healing and frostbite. The spell I've had this problem with the most is the conjure avengeing wraith spell from apocalypse which is very annoying because it drains pretty much my whole magicka bar (which is only like 50 because of YASH).

EDIT: I think it's just registering multiple clicks because when I'm trying to navigate a menu it sometimes clicks multiple times as well.

EDIT 2 ELECTRIC BOOGALOO: I figured out the problem, YASH of all things was somehow causing spells to stop working midway trough casting, nit even staffs, just spells. I've gotten rid of YASH and tried the same spells that weren't working and now they do, I'm guessing it has something to do with how it decreases your magicka pool to like 5 points and it just get stuck on the idea that you have 5 magicka?

skyrim,2022,1,"Hey there. First of all, I'm sorry if this isn't the place to put this, but I am brand-spanking-new to this reddit and have no idea what I'm doing. As for Skyrim, I've been playing it since 2011 :)

I'm encountering three bugs at the moment in the anniversary edition.

The first bug: this one I have searched up, but most methods include using the console to skip to the end, but I can't do that because I'm achievement hunting on my legendary difficulty save and it would absolutely KILL ME to have to make a new one just to get some end game achievements. I'm doing the siege on Whiterun with the stormcloaks (because who sides with the imperials) and the game registers me as swimming which then leads to me drowning/dying to guards. I've tried reloading the game/save, but no luck there. I've also tried leaving the area, which helps in some cases, but then when I return I just start swimming again.

The second bug: this one is more of an annoyance than anything. When I kill a guard, more specifically during the Whiterun siege (IF I CAN), Feran Sadri's framing quest pops up telling me to plant the note on the dead guard. Issue is, I don't have any note and I did not pick up the quest beforehand. I am a werewolf now and it's my second time being a werewolf in that playthrough. The quest has no description when I look at it and I can't get rid of it afterwards.

The third bug: Neloth was starting to do his experiments on me, however he decided not to and the quest did not start. The dialog is completely gone so I can't try to pick up the quest again, however when I die, the quest starts. Only issue is, I'm dead, and I go back to the previous save without the quest.

Any ideas? I'm really stuck and I just need to complete the civil war quest-line in order to be done with all the main quest-lines (Dragonborn, Dawnguard, Alduin). Like I said above, I CANNOT use the console if it's going to disable achievements.

Instead, I was accosted by a guard saying I owed a fine. Like an idiot I paid it instead of killing him, and ended up inside Solitude. The battle changes to the city scenery were there and the battle had started. Fastforward thru the win and Ulfric's victory speech, I follow him to the gate (not wanting a repeat of the Whiterun glitch). Lo and behold, just outside the gate is Ulfric giving his prefight speech...next to the just-won-the-battle Ulfric. Gate won't let me in saying I need to defend the city first.

skyrim,2022,1,"So I started a new playthrough minutes into the new year.  Goal is to immerse myself completely and enjoy Skyrim in every bit of detail. I want to make this playthrough longest one I ever had. I play graphically vanilla Anniverary Edition with all the creations and mods coming with it, and nothing else.

I focus heavily on roleplay. Here's what I've done/experienced so far:

I arrived Riverwood with Hadvar and stayed in Alvor's house. I work as a lumberjack and Hod's paying really well. I've already spent few ingame days just living and breathing in Riverwood.

I wake up before 6am, have a short breakfast and head out to work. Chop wood till about noon, when I get hungry/tired (Survival mode really fits perfect here, chopping wood is a hard job). So I get my midday pay from Hod and have a little rest and lunch. Continue working till nightfall. Sometimes I work so late I have to find Hod in the inn to pay me.  Second day was rainy so I put on my novice hood looted in Helgen, came in handy.

Who said Skyrim's economy is bad? I earned 2000 coins for couple of days of hard work. I cook my own meals and sleep for free in Alvor's bed who, by the way, spends most of the night at the inn. I sleep next to Sigurd but she doesn't mind.

After couple of days of hard work I allow myself to relax for a single day. I walk around Riverwood and start noticing things.

For example, Hod is now repairing homes around the town instead of working at the mill. His wife, Gerdur, took his position for a day. Btw, Gerdur really, I mean really loves visitting Alvor when he works. Often she just watches him work, don't know what to think about that.

Sven and Faendal are like children fighting over Camilia. Faendal wanted me to lie to Camilia and give her a fake letter. And then I swear I kept seeing him everywhere, almost as if he was following me. I went to Lucan tradehouse, turn around and saw him standing right behind me. Then I chopped wood and he was just standing there watching me. Sven may be childlish but there's something even worse about Faendal. He acts like a real stalker. One night at the inn he scolded at Sven to leave Camila alone. So I decided to take Sven's side and told Camila the truth.

Sigurd, Alvor's wife, seems to be a dreamer. Often she reclines on the porch and stares into the distance, watching the river and distant forests. She cares about her daughter and wants her to be girly, but I have a feeling she isn't really happy with Alvor.

So, those are my days in Riverwood. I plan to continue like this for a while and earn few thousand coins. I made me an adventurer backpack and kept old Imperial armour, although I wear plain tunic.

Some of the rules for this playthrough:

Walk everywhere - I got used to it already i previous plays. I relly enjoy walking through Skyrim, makes it bigger and I enjoy every bit of its atmosphere. I may occasionally run if it rains, but even then not for too long. Running is reserved for fighting.

Sleep/eat pattern is essential and managed by Survival mode. Also, keeping myself warm.

I will wear armour and weapon only when I'm on a mission. And only armor that I craft. No eating during combat. Potions are okay, in limited number, since NPCs too use potions mid battle.

Next moves and overal goals:

After I hang around Riverwood enough and buy me a steel armour from Alvor, I'll head to Bleack Falls barrow to retrieve golden claw and dragonstone. Riverwood really suffers from this ancient burial site and no one dares to go there, even Hadvar. Then I plan to walk to Whiterun and trigger main quest, send guards to Riverwood and have Lydia as a follower. I also want to go to Solitude and meet Jordis Shield-Maiden. I've never even seen her in game or used as a follower, but I'd like to try her. Eventually I'll become a steel plated knight known throughout Skyrim for fighting dragons and helping and healing those in need. For now, I'm but a humble but a strong lumberjack in Riverwood.",2022-01-01 07:41:27

I have completed Balance of Power and Restoring Order (I took both the sword and the amber) but I still get attacked by bandits all the time. If it was just me getting attacked it would be fine, but they also attack and kill every NPC they encounter. As far as I know they should stop attacking when killing Thoron and completing the quests...

Does anyone have this problem - or know a way to make it stop? 

Thanks and happy new year.",2022-01-01 08:06:07

I decided to purchase the AE while it was on sale for the holidays since the script extender has been updated (at least, to an early build). Just to be safe, though, I went ahead and uninstalled all my mods long enough to install all the AE CC mods and check them out without the worry of incompatibility with my other mods. 

The first issue came last night when my game refused to launch, saying it was missing bink2w64.dll. I googled how to fix that, and I followed a guide online that got the game running properly. I assume that issue is resolved now, but I figured I'd mention it in case it could play a part in all this. Once Skyrim launched, it prompted me to download all of the AE mods. I accepted the prompt and walked away while it downloaded my mods. When I came back, though, the game had crashed. I relaunched it and saw that a little over half the mods were downloaded and installed. On the ""featured"" tab, I was clicking through the various mods when I realized that it didn't download and install Goldbrand. So, I downloaded it. When I went to close the Creation Club, it said that new mods were downloaded and that the game needed to reload. I clicked ""yes"" to let it reload, and the game crashed. When I relaunched the game, Goldbrand was again not downloaded or installed. So, I downloaded it again, tried to reload it again, and it crashed and failed to download and install. I tried other mods that I was missing and they won't properly download or install either. It will go through the ""downloading"" process, hit 100% and say it's ""installed"", but then the game will close when I press ""reload"" and when I relaunch it the mod will no longer be downloaded or installed.

skyrim,2022,1,"With the introduction of Survival Mode in the Anniversary update I decided to start a new playthrough. I have a handful of mods which improve gameplay (CFTO) and fix bugs (USSEP) but it is very close to vanilla.

My character - a nord - focused on one-handed, light-armor, enchanting, smithing, and some magic. After playing through every side quest, daedric quest, all the faction quests, Building a house, the DLCs, the main story, and closing out my misc. objectives I had made it to level 70.

The only objectives left in my journal were  ""Talk to the companion leaders for work"" and ""The Dark Brotherhood Forever"".  So, my character returned to the College of Winterhold to focus on becoming a master of magic (spamming muffle, telekinesis, equilibrium, healing spells, etc.)

I managed to naturally level my character to 80 and went out in search of the ebony warrior and a legendary dragon. After a while I finally found both. With the legendary dragon slayed, I finally got that elusive achievement.

The only achievement left was to get a 1000 gold bounty in every hold. So I set about casting storm call and firestorm in all the populated areas. Skyrim had been saved by the dragonborn only suffer again at my hand. I felt bad about the whole thing, I got the achievement though.

I was ready for my final battle. I arrived at Last Vigil armed to the teeth with my master destruction , over-enchanted gear, and many potions. Either he dies or I return to Sovngarde. The battle was tough but I was victorious in the end.

The encounter with the ebony warrior got me thinking, what awaits the dragonborn after death? I have pledged my eternal soul to Nocturnal and Lord Hircine at the very least and my soul has somehow become entwined with the Soul Cairn and there may be others with a claim to my soul - I don't remember. I just have a habit of using my soul as collateral, but what happens when the debt collectors come? I cured my lycanthropy to help alleviate the problem but I was still not sure if Sovngarde was to be my final destination or not.

I decided to take matters into my own hands. My character sequestered themselves in the College of Winterhold and deeply studied the mysteries of Aetherius. It was there that my character unlocked powers unknown to even the most powerful mages in Tamriel (console commands). A specific set of spell scripts were used to clear out those radiant quests that were stuck in the journal.

With every hold having put a bounty on my head and more than a few daedric realms with a claim to my soul, I decided to take a inspiration from an old vampire I once knew - Valerica. Valerica had opened a portal to a daedric realm - the Soul Cairn - to hide herself and a powerful elder scroll from the mortal plain. I could do the same. I could leave Nirn behind and retire to Sovngarde where no daedra or aedra, no man or mer can find me.

Half my work is already done - Alduin had opened a portal to Sovngarde. The entrance lies high in the mountains in the ruins of Skuldafn - a place only reachable if you have the wings of a dragon or if you have unraveled the secrets of Aetherius.  I used a bespoke teleportation spell (Coc Skuldafn01) to arrive at Skuldafn. Although Alduin was long gone, the portal was still guarded by dragons and draugr. Utilizing Dragon Aspect and Storm Call I made short work of the deathlords and overlords. Finally, I arrived at the portal. A dragon priest's staff held the portal open. I removed the staff and jumped into the portal as it closed forever behind me.

While in Sovngarde I do not experience tiredness or hunger or cold. As a dragonborn who has absorbed many dragon souls - I imagine I may already be immortal. But, I am not sure. In Sovngarde I am certain to exist forever, enjoying the unending feast and songs of glorious battles. Should Tamriel ever need me again - Tsun can return me to the mortal plain. But not for a few hundred years at least. I gotta let the whole ""1000 gold bounty"" thing blow over first.",2022-01-01 16:12:35

It's really fun to just yeet people across the map but I feel that it may be a bit too overpowered and that it trivializes the game.   


What do you guys think?",2022-01-01 17:05:21
skyrim,2022,1,"As far as the major cities go, I think either Riften or Markarth are my favourite in terms of the design and appearance. I like Riften's design of wooden structures on the water as it reminds me of Bravil from Oblivion, and I also like the environment of that area. Markarth on the other hand is just beautiful and I've never seen anything quite like it.

In terms of which city I'd rather live in though, I'd probably want to live in Whiterun. It seems the most equal socio-economically (as there doesn't seem to be anyone who's really poor), it has a good diverse and thriving economy, and it's the only one of the major cities where the Jarl isn't either a douchebag or a puppet for someone else.

For the medium-sized towns, I like the look of Dawnstar but I would get sick of the weather. So I think I would rather live in Falkreath as I much prefer that type of environment. Neither Winterhold nor Morthal seem like nice places to live.

As for the villages: Riverwood – easily. It's beautiful there, it actually has a decent amount of shops, and seems to be the most lively out of Skyrim's villages by far.",2022-01-01 17:05:52

The rest of the civil war questline seems to be working just fine, but I'm still worried that this may cause a gamebreaking bug after some time. The only save I have is just before the Battle for Whiterun quest. In theory, I could just rush the quest again with ""tgm"" active, but idk. This feels like a win-win situation: side with the stormcloaks and still keep the best jarl in place.

&amp;#x200B;

Should I go back to my previous save to avoid bugs? Is there a way for me to fix it with console commands or something else?

By the way, the city has stormcloak soldiers in it (even a stormcloak general up Dragonreach's stairs), so it kinda feels like Balgruuf decided to surrender and side with Ulfric after he lost the war (if you desconsider the dialogue, ofc). I'm almost 100% certain that this is not one of my mod features, since I have no civil war mods.

skyrim,2022,1,"Hi, all! Hope I'm not out of place posting this here, let me know if I am. Anyways... I downloaded Skyrim Anniversary Edition on Steam yesterday, and... it's been buggy.

TL;DR, creation club mods being buggy, specifically the quest mods not loading despite the fact I downloaded them all.

To start off, as I was trying to start a new game or load an old one, it would crash the game. I decided to try a clean reinstall, and that was enough to actually make the game playable again. So, I do what anyone would do, and I start a new game.

I'm no stranger to the creation club add-ons, and have played with them before. I was thoroughly convinced that leaving Helgen would be sufficient to trigger most of the add-ons in my quest log. When I played earlier today, this just did not happen. Before the Storm was the only quest in my quest log, nothing I did triggered it. I went to Riverwood, and I put in some console commands just to test to see if the armors from the creation club were visible... low and behold, they were, which further adds to the mystery of what is going on?

So I go to try to figure out what the problem was 5 minutes ago. I log on to my game, and suddenly 3 of the creation club quests were triggered, which was confusing, to say the least, given I have been used to 30ish, give or take, triggering just after Helgen.

I've tried to look in the creation club menu, and it claims all of the add-ons have been downloaded. I've also tried googling exactly what was going on- some people have similar issues to mine where the creation club stuff is not loading, except the armor mods are and the quest mods are not.

Does anyone have any suggestions? Is there a fix/something I can try? Thank you all, Happy New Year if you celebrate :)",2022-01-01 23:48:18

While it teaches you a million diverse things, social skills, it doesn’t. I seldom attempted to expand my social circle because of that. I found it hard to fit into cliques and would often keep to myself.  While I wasn’t really shy, I maintained my distance from almost everyone in my grade.

Back home on a sick day from school (because I fractured my leg), my best friend at the time bought me a copy of Skyrim. Like most open-world RPG’s of the time, it centers around a protagonist who goes on adventures to save the world. 

Skyrim was different. It introduced me to political conflicts and the thin line between right and wrong and how at any given point in time, your life can change. I built my character based on myself and made him an introvert (like me!). Not long thereafter (spoiler alert) I’m attacked by a dragon, get in the middle of a civil war and the fate of the world was in my hands. 

This game, despite all its flaws and glitches empowered me to break out of my shell and taught me that not even the world’s most powerful dragon can beat a person who is determined in their cause and would sacrifice anything to get reach their goals. 

I’m tired of my friends judging me for liking this beautiful game and I unironically love this even after 10 whole goddamn years. While I’m no longer friends (or even talk to the guy) who introduced me to my favorite game, I’ll never ever forget what he’s done for me and he’ll always have a place in my heart. 

Stay safe fellow adventurers and all the best to all of the people who’ve first stumbled upon this game. I’d do anything to go back half a decade just to relieve this game once again.",2022-01-02 02:38:28

skyrim,2022,1,"I'm level 57, running 200 mods, got SKSE (AE version for AE) and a high end PC. 

The game has played out smoothly until now. Everything major I do that has to load new staff, such as entering a new zone, waiting/sleeping, using some spells and walking about 50 meters from the last save location, will CTD. No new mods added or removed recently. 

Is the run running out of memory? The newest ESS save file uses 10443 kb and the SKSE file uses 1818 kb, not sure if that's too much. Almost all other save files are deleted.  The PC itself has 200 gb free memory so the issue should be Skyrim's code and engine limits if memory is to blame. 

Aside from memory, I have no clue what could do it. Google provides no help.

skyrim,2022,1,"Alduin isn't the villain.

I don't know if this has been mentioned before, but here goes.

1. *Helgen*

Most of the time it seems like what happened at Helgen was a coincidence, but what if he deliberately saved you? You really think he just happened to rock  up just before you died? 

2. *Early dragon encounters*

If my memory serves me right, it is impossible to encounter a dragon before the watchtower, and if you think about it, you arrive and attack the dragon, you make the first move, maybe that is what triggered the dragons' aggression in the rest of the game.

3. *Nords*

It appears that the dragons where the original inhabitants of skyrim, meaning that the nords invaded their homelands and massacred the population and then playing victim when the dragons retaliated.

4. *The world*

It is practically confirmed in the game that Alduin will destroy the world, correct? Well what if parthunaax was right? That the world needed to be destroyed in order to create a new one?

5. *Conclusion*

As far as I can tell, this evidence displays Adluin as more of an Anti-hero or maybe even a hero. But of course, I could be missing a major point, make sure to correct any of my mistakes!

skyrim,2022,1,"Is it just me or is the Civil War a bit of a let down? Was marching through Windhelm before I knew what happened. I’m on my 5th character and I haven’t done this quest line yet as I was saving it for my Imperial Sword n Board Paladin. 

Really feels like the side quests could have been more fleshed out. Even for taking Windhelm, there should have been multiple stages. Would have been amazing if the catapults in the Imperial siege encampment actually came into use to soften up the defenses, or some sort of quest to open up the city gates. Hell it should have been a fight to even get across the bridge from the stables.

skyrim,2022,1,"Waking up early, I saw that I was the first to wake up. Ralof was in a chair, since I took the extra bed. I left silently, hoping no one woke up. The vakka was rising as I went to the inn for some food. I went up to the bar, ordering some salmon meat and ale. As I ate, I saw a woman glaring at me as she sweep the floor. I greeted her as she came towards me. Asking if I was that visitor who been poking around. Poking around? I just came to eat and wait for faendal. She said she knows that I stay with gerdur and her family. She said it such a small town that any changes are noted. Especially an argonian coming here. They usually stay in windhelm and riften. I nodded as I told her I saw them. The door open and faendal came in. He also order some food, glaring when he saw sven starting a song. I didn't noticed sven since the woman held my attention. Faendal said hi delphine. She smiled and talk with faendal about the mill. She then told orgnar that the ale was going bad. We finish and I said goodbye to them.

As we left, I ask faendal about delphine. He told me that delphine is the owner of the inn. She a good person, always keeping the inn running despite how small the town is. He joke saying if it wasn't for embry, the drunk, they probably be out of business. I told faendal that we need to head to the valtheim towers first. We walk towards whiterun and instead of heading to the city, we went down instead. The towers had a bandit standing there, watching the road. As we approach, she asks us to pay the toll of 200 gold. I refused and killed her. Faendal said he going up high and I clear the way. He stood at the top of the first tower and did what bosmer are known for. His archery skills made me shock as I watch. He took care of the enemy archer as I walk on the bridge. The bandit chief met me in the middle and I block, being careful not to fall off. He was under an arch so faendal couldn't shoot him. No wonder amren had problems getting his sword. I couldn't use my tail as he might grab it and throw me off the bridge.  I was about to lose my temper til I remember my training. I remembered my deelith telling me to fight him on a log. Wouldn't tell me more til I fought him. Took a week til he stop me. Said I lack forethought and how to use the log to my advantage. I ask how and he said use your feet. I grin at the chief as I rush at him, jump over him and kick him out of the arch. Faendal let loose an arrow that hit him in his throat. He turn around in shock as i push him off the bridge. Gave a small wave to let him know that we was done with enemies. I saw him running towards me, his quiver halfway gone. Gave him more steel arrows as I walk up the second tower. A huge chest was there. I open it and saw the sword. I collect it and told faendal thanks for the help. 

We went back to whiterun to return the sword. He taught me a skill for swordplay which I could have used under the bridge. He taught me to jump slash in a certain way.  I thank him as I used it. Only jump slash I learnt is the saxhleel way. We often jump over, uses our tail to strike in a spot on the head area and kick them which I did to the bandit chief.  This one uses the sword to strike, slashing the neck or body as you land. Which made me hiss in satisfaction. I left with faendal, saying im going to take a carriage to riften. I didn't give the city a chance since I only was outside it on the docks. He said he is going to come as it was exciting to use his skills for more than hunting. I can see us becoming close friends as I pay the driver and we sat down in the carriage.",2022-01-02 04:24:13
skyrim,2022,1,"*tl;dr - I want to get back in the game, but I would like to know if the enemies take a lot of hits to be killed in survival mode? I'm on ps4 so no access to mods besides whats included in the anniversary edition*

Hey folks. I'm considering getting the game now that its on sale on the psn store, but I wanted to know something first. I know its really cheap right now, but I live in a third world country and finding steady employment is super tough, so yeah... have to consider what to spend my money on.

Last time I played Skyrim was back when x360 was the current generation of consoles. There was no Survival mode then. I always play in max difficulty and I remember that some enemies were essentially damage sponges which was a big turn off as it kind of broke the immersion when you have to swing non stop at some random bandit.

Now that Skyrim Anniversary Edition has been released, I want to see what a decade of content has brought to the game. I'm specially interested in Survival mode.

In Fallout 4, Survival mode is tough as nails but fair. Both you and your enemies take increased so, unless you are fighting a mutated legendary enemy, there were no damage sponges. Specially the way I chose to play the game, I went for full immersion (regular clothes, no armor, no health leveling etc) so every encounter was old school Rainbow Six deadly. It really reinforced the idea of a hostile post apocalyptic game world. 

Can I achieve something similar in Skyrim Survival mode? I plan on doing a greatsword heavy armor build and a full mage.

Hubby and I recently acquired Skyrim: Anniversary Edition and he was super excited to find out the Coal made a comeback! 

Because it is the anniversary edition, all of the Creation Club goodies downloaded for free. He quickly went after the quest for the Cowl, but has become stuck.

He is tasked to find the thief, kill him, and loot the body. From there, he is supposed to get a note that continues the quest line. However, when he comes up to the thief, he's already dead and when the option to loot opens up, there is nothing to grab, and the quest marker is stuck on the dead body.

Is there a fix to this? He's fine if he has to start a whole new game, but would prefer to know asap so he's not wasting his time ona character he won't play due to glitches.

For a game that’s 10+ years old, I can’t believe how incredibly immersive and reactive the world/environment is, and I’m sorta beating myself up for not giving this a go so much sooner. 

That being said, I’m aware of some glitches/bugs that the Devs never really fully patched out, so I’m not sure if this is that or if there is a known fix for this issue, but when entering my Quest menu, favorites list, or inventory of myself or downed enemy, there is a great bit of delay from the time the menu opens, to when I’m actually able to move around within it. Sometimes closing and reopening the menu seems to fix this issue, but other times I kinda just have to sit there and wait for the game to catch up with me. I’m playing on launch gen Xbox One, and I DID download the game, not using the Xbox game streaming service. Most all settings are default with the exception of a few custom keybinds.

I'd just experienced the quest where I have to defend winterhold from those ridiculously high hp ancano spawns that don't really do anything but exist with an insane hp pool. This experience made me think that the difficulty seems to be unenjoyable and unplayable with any other build since the players damage is so tiny. 



Is it the way it is with oblivion where the highest difficulty is only played if you use some gamebreaking glitches and unbalanced builds? 


I need to know because I have this urge for accomplishments that stands in the way of reducing the difficulty and on the other hand the game seems unenjoyable when I have to change my playstyle to something without 15x damage amplifier.",2022-01-02 17:07:13

skyrim,2022,1,"So I know there’s an issue with this bow that when you fire, your invincibility breaks and it interferes with stealth attacks. 

BUT, I’ve also noticed that even when you’re not invisible it’s almost impossible to get sneak attacks with this bow. I went through half a dungeon with the bow of shadows out, not invisible, perfectly stealthed, and only about 20% shots were a sneak attack. 

I went through the second half of the dungeon after switching to a steel bow and 100% of my attacks were Registering as stealth. 

Has anyone else had this problem and is there a possible fix? I love the bow because of how fast it fires but not being able to stealth attack sucks ass! /l",2022-01-02 17:12:31

skyrim,2022,1,I’ve played through Skyrim at least 30 times over the years on several consoles and thought I had done everything the game had to offer but after a conversation with my friend I realized I never really got into role playing it as a character. I just made whatever decisions I would make in the situation instead of putting myself in my character’s shoes and now I have no idea where to start. How do y’all build up y’all’s characters to role play them? Where do I even start?,2022-01-02 17:21:18
skyrim,2022,1,"Working for the Companions, Farkas and I got the fragment of Wuufthrad and made it back to Whiterun.  However, Farkas refuses to enter the city and just stands outside the gate.  If I go in and do the ceremony where they welcome me to the companions without him, it plays out as normal but when he would speak it is silent.  Once its over, me and everyone in the circle are just stuck in place.   Waiting, reloading saves, completing other quests and coming back doesn't seem to change anything.  All mods are disabled.  I even punched a guard, ran to the companions so the dialogue initiated hoping the guard would ""apprehend me"" and take me out of it but he just stood around then left.  

Does anybody know any way to fix this?  I've browsed multiple forums looking for ideas to no avail.  Any luck is appreciated.

skyrim,2022,1,"When I go into Lakeview Manor, if I try to wait or sleep, I get a popup in the corner of the screen saying ""You cannot wait/sleep while being asked to leave"" and I don't know how to fix it.  When I do the console command ""player.isTrespassing"" the result is 0.00, and nobody in the house actually tells me, ""You're not supposed to be here"" or ""I think you should leave"" or any of the things you're typically told when trespassing.  When I speak to my steward, wife, and housecarl, they all greet me with the typical, ""Long life to you, Thane"" or ""Hello, love"" but they don't want me to wait or sleep.

I tried using the ""setownership"" command, but it made no difference (I've selected the door from both inside and outside the house).  I do not face the same problem when sleeping in Breezehome or in any of the other Hearthfire homes.  It doesn't even happen if I'm in the basement of Lakeview Manor, I'm allowed to wait down there.

Is there a fix for this?  I've done some googling and I've tried all the suggestions, but they haven't fixed anything (I even tried murdering my steward.  It did not work.).  I'm a bit worried it has something to do with my load order some how?  I used to use Nexus Mod Manager but recently switched everything over to Vortex, because I was reading a lot about how you shouldn't use NMM, but I can't figure out how to rearrange my load order.

Also, I can't load a previous save from in-game.  I haven't been able to do it for a long time, and I guess I should have been more concerned about it.  Basically, when I try to click ""Load Save"" it makes the click sound and she saves just kind of jump, and when I click the select button, it just doesn't load the save.  When I click ""Quit to Main Menu"" I can load older saves through there.

I’m a big Elder Scrolls fan, Morrowind got played out. My notebook which I wish I still had for posterity was filled to the brim, scrappy and thick. 

I’m a big Wheel of Time fan. The paperbacks got worn out and the series gets played in my audiobooks (listen while I work) constantly. 

Today I started a new character, and I’m playing differently. I’m older now, not as glitch happy as I played almost all of the games before, to the extent that I can’t remember the last time I didn’t take advantage of Ralof the punching bag at the start. I’m playing truly as I would were it “real”. And I’m taking in all the little details with a patience I haven’t really had the last time I played Skyrim. Reading the books is something I’ve done in game, but I never really absorbed the info and related it to something outside Elder Scrolls. The end of The Book of the Dragonborn is where it happened. The mention of the Towers in the prophecy tickled at the connection, and I re read it several times as it dawned on me. I’ve sat here thinking slack jawed and digging through internet stuffs for longer than I’d care to admit.

  Thalia The Shadow Caster  
 

""In the 22nd year of the 4E, we fled, leaving everything behind to be just to keep our lives as the Thalmor began what would later be known to them as ""the Great purging of Alinor"". To those who ran it was nothing but a political genocide,  a cruel and devastating event sending ripples throughout the Altmer for generations to come. I was only a child back then, but the Thalmor wouldn't have cared would we have stayed. Even though I only bear vague memories of the event, it still haunts my dreams at night. A child's life, forfeit for the crime of being born in a family loyal to the monarchy. We fled over the sea to Hammerfell in search of refuge amongst the Yokudans or as they are commonly known ""Redguards"". As refugees we settled in the province of Sentinel and for 20 years, the survivors  strived to find solace in the hard work of building a new life. But Zealotry doesn't sleep. And so in year 42 we were found by Thalmor agents and attacked in the middle of night. ""The night of Green Fire"" is said to have left no survivors amongst the refugees. Not a single one, except me, and to this day it is my shame. On that night, knowing nothing but flight I left my parents and kin behind to die, bravely defending themselves. When I later heard there were no other survivors I swore my revenge on the Thalmor and anyone allied to them. Crossing the border into High Rock I came to the City of Wayrest where I found a place of seclution. But I found more, the means of my revenge and a new family, the Dark Brotherhood.  
 For over 100 years I lived my life as a castaway in the shadows, serving an order of assassins, ever honing my skills up until the rule of the traitor king Barynia and the corsair invasion, which caused the destruction of Wayrest sactuary.  
 And so I fled one last time, to see my time through as a vagabond in a post Great War dystopia, hiding from both Empire and Aldmeri dominion alike.  
 Now I am old, and I've witnessed far to much death. But the recent news of an uprising in Skyrim against the Empire pulls on me. The power of the Thalmor is ever growing after striking a deal with the Emperor, this cursed White-Gold Concordat. If this is the way to finally close the circle, I will take my chances. My path leads to Skyrim, to the last remaining sanctuary of the Brotherhood and most likely my own death. But at least I will fight the Thalmor to my dying breath.""

CHARRACHTER PLAYTHROUGH  
 Completing the Brotherhood questline ASAP, and will recognize Cicero as an ally.  
 Will side with The Stormcloaks in the Civil war due to the Emperors bowing to the Thalmor.  
 After learning about being dragon born, sees shouts as further means of destruction against foes.  
 Will not join the Blades due to their Loyalty to the Empire.  
 Will do mercenary work for money. Will not join the thieves guild however. Since it could destabilize the new rule of Skyrim.  
 Will do a minimum of ""good deeds"" quests.  
 Will side with the Redguards looking for Sadia.  
 Will stay away from Thalmor and Empire patrols, but will not hesitate killing them off if confronted by them.  
 Dawnguard Optional - since having lived most of her life in the Illiac Bay region she has dealt a lot with the various clans of the area before.

Story:
Follower of the DeathBringer Fighters, evolved and adapted for long life and combat skill as well as battle magic, he was with the group from a very young age. 

His “family” back in  Hammerfell are his fellow DeathBringers, but he branched out on his own and is no longer affiliated with the group. 

In search of more fortune and experience he crossed into Skyrim illegally, falling into the same ambush as Ulfric and the Stormcloaks. 

His goals upon crossing the border are to seek out bounties and contracts against men, mer and monsters, mainly for monetary gain and to become a better warrior.

Worships no gods or daedra, nor has a political leaning in Skyrim, asides from resenting the Thalmor who invaded his homeland when he was young.",2022-01-02 23:12:10

skyrim,2022,1,"So I'm more fully fleshing out my Argonian as I'm having resetitus with her. I think I want to do a run where she keeps a daily journal to really get in her head. But something that helps me with high fantasy characters is having an idea of their alignment and well... I'm not sure. I'm leaning towards Chaotic Neutral (not the zany flavor many people associate with that alignment, ie Jack Sparrow, but a more grounded/jaded variant) but I'd love to discuss this and see what you guys think. Any alignment is fine, I'm not trying to play a ""good"" character or anything. (For what it's worth, if I was a GM I'd let this character be Chaotic Neutral but I don't straightjacket alignments and am more than happy to be convinced a character is following one.)

Here's her information, let me know what you think!

\-----

**Name:** Nurayee

**Gender:** Female

**Race:** Argonian

**Age:** 37

**Class:** Thief

**Skills:** Light Armor, Sneak, Lockpicking, Pickpocket, Speech, Alchemy (One-Handed just to boost base damage).

**Alignment:** Chaotic Neutral (EDIT: Very likely changing to Lawful Neutral based on feedback so far)

**Backstory:** Born in Cyrodiil in 164 4E to merchant parents, she was seven when the Great War broke out. She was nine when her parents were killed as a result of a battle with the Aldmeri Dominion and forced into the streets. Surviving involved becoming and honing her skills as a thief. She often made decisions she wasn’t thrilled with and by the time she was a teenager she felt she understood how the world really worked - and anyone that thought otherwise was a naive fool.

Her traumatic youth &amp; the war caused her to develop a contempt for politics and a highly jaded view of the world. She doesn’t feel it really matters who is in power but does recognize if you’ve not put yourself at the top then you should you're at the mercy of those that are. She spent her life up until this point floating in and out of various illicit organizations, serving primarily as a sell-dagger whose loyalty went only so far as the earned influence.

An attempt at smuggling goods across the Cyrodiil-Skyrim border went horribly wrong when she managed to get caught up in the ambush that led to Ulfric’s capture. With no taste for the potential consequences of failure back home, she is happy to let it be believed by her Cyrodiil contacts she died in the chaos while she pursues a future in Skyrim

**Personality:** She truly feels “rules” are simply a power structure used by those in charge to control those beneath and will both follow and enforce them (or not) with that in mind. She will not go out of her way to harm the average person, but she isn’t fond of the naive foolishness she feels the average person operates under. She will threaten and manipulate under the belief she is doing people a favor by showing them the truth of the world. If they complain about it, she is prone to telling them that if it bothers them that much they should “do something about it”.

She is not a person without hypocrisy. It rubs her wrong when people, particularly the extremely poor and children, are being kicked by the realities of life. She would put a dagger in the hands of both groups and “educate” them about the realities of the world, so she isn’t the world's best role model. She also believes that those in (actual) power should make an effort to not abuse those under them… unless they need to be reminded of the power structure. While capable of giving loyalty &amp; a level of trust to others, it is conditional and fleeting. She is the type to sleep with one eye open even around those she has come to feel are on her side. If you betray her from that position, she WILL make sure you pay for it one way or another.

**Other:** She'll be joining the Thieves Guild and Maven's control of Riften is just how the world works in her jaded worldview (she DOES think Black-Briar Mead is the tastiest Skyrim has to offer, which doesn't hurt).

Outside of Thieves Guild jobs, she only steals from the richer class with a case-by-case willingness to go after merchants. An example of a case-by-case is she'd leave Arcadia's Cauldron alone but would have no problems doing a thieving blitz of Radiant Raiment. (Since she's got some trauma-induced issues with Altmer (not fair, but it's there), it's worth noting she'd do it even if they were another race. It's the fact they're stupid rich and total jerks.) Oh, and guards/soldiers are completely fair game too, although she finds they often don't carry much worth the time.",2022-01-02 23:55:46

skyrim,2022,1,"A work around I’ve found for this glitch that mostly happens when you use population mods, is to use a custom group kind of mod so the bug attaches to them rather than the people generated by the population mod

I usually just place it high in the LO doesn’t matter where unless you use city overhauls then id say place it below them so they adjust (I usually don’t because they despawn eventually anyway).

Only slight problem is like 1:20 npcs may have it, i haven’t seen them in awhile but it may happen just a warning but this “fixes” it.

(At the time I was about 8, now I'm 14, 15 in January) I loved the game, you cant Really be good at skyrim, but I'm fast and efficient in next to every game I play. He had about 100 hours on his account that I was playing on, and he was only halfway through the game (main storyline) hed done barely any side quests, but he was maxed in terms of perks and he was high level, around 60. I'm now level 111 on my main with 60 hours. Anyway, I beat the game within 3 hours, including about 40 side quests, (its alot I know, especially for an 8 year old.) I never listened to anyone in game, I just did the quest, which made me alot faster. Anyway, where i am now. 2 weeks ago i bought anniversary disk edition for my ps4. After about a year of not playing. I had a ps3, from 6 years old to 13 years old, and I was fine with it. I got my ps4 last year, and I had to say good bye to a nearly completed game, with over 3000 hours (multiple accounts) I used to get up at 3am, grind, go to school at 8. That was my routine, then I'd get home, do chores grind till 10pm and repeat. Now I play about 6 hours a day (holidays) and I just go about my day normally. Doing my actual routine, and working out. Shats your story?


TL;DR My mums friend let me play on his ps3, I became addicted to the game. I bought skyrim for my ps3, I had 3000 hours easily and I changed to ps4, anniversary edition and now im. level 111 with 60 hours on my main.

Don't make this mistake.  Choose a lane and follow a storyline. If you don't like it, you can always start over if you want rather than being forced to due to a clusterfuck of information.

skyrim,2022,1,"# My FIRST EVER Skyrim Adventure: Part 2

***~~Completed Quest: Unbound~~***

***New Quest – Talk to Alvor in Riverwood.***

Hadvar and I decided to stick together during the walk out of the cave, during the walk he spoke of joining the Imperials, I was not certain as to which path I would take, but I was genuinely considering joining them.

I was shown Bleak Falls Barrow (BFB), and immediately decided to go there, because it looked cool. I fell down a hill and stumbled upon the Thief stone, Mage stone and Warrior stone.

I picked the **Warrior** stone because all combat skills can be learned 20% faster, which will help.

On my way to BFB I jumped into a river and accidentally caught some salmon, I continued to swim across, but I accidentally fell down a waterfall. During this moment I decided to collect a whole bunch of salmon like a bear.

I managed to cross the river and immediately got ambushed by some wolves. They were no match for my axe.

I saw a deer the wolves must have been chasing and went to hunt it, then out of no-where a Bandit Chief decided to test his mettle against me by swinging his axe like a madman. I was losing health rapidly, but I levelled up and it healed me! Which was super helpful.

I put my first ever skill point in to blocking, I was using a shield at the time, and I thought it could help. The bandit chief was too strong and was about to waste me, for some reason I got a notification to use health potions, which prompted the menu screen to appear.

I decided MID-FIGHT, to completely change clothes, drink some potions, change weapons, drop a few of the armours I collected from the dead storm cloaks, all under 0.01 seconds in game time.

The bandit chief was a hard foe. During the fight I even levelled up again to Level 3!

After repeatedly hitting this bandit chief in the head with my blunt axe, the head trauma was too much, and he fell and died.

His bandit friend watched in horror, trembling. I quickly ran over to the mewling quim and slit his throat. Covered with the blood of enemies, I chased down the last bandit, who had booked it down the hill.

He screamed “Enough! I cannot best you!”

His fate was sealed and I chopped his head clean off.

I felt no remorse, they deserved it.

I found Anise’s cabin on my way to BFB after cleaning off the blood from my blade.

She greeted me kindly, I felt very welcome, and I saw her stuff and stole the lot. There was nothing stopping me from stealing everything and I wasn’t getting in trouble, so I just stole everything she had in her house.

I wished her luck and went on my way towards BFB, I was so close!

I found the path that led straight to the entrance, cleaned out the last of the bandit infestation plaguing the area. There was a kill cam moment where I sliced a bandit’s throat with my sheild. It felt completely badass.

I made it to Bleak Falls Barrow, levelled up my Stamina, and made put a skill point in to my one handed and entered through the doors.

First, I used Hendraheim, from the CC, as a substitute for Breezehome.

Second, I used a thralled Draugr Deathlord to wake Vulthuryol, a dragon you can fight without waking the Dragons with the main quest (check out his UESP or wikipage for more info) and used his soul for the Slow Time shout.

Then, I used the standard method to get both items with these changes: After leaving the cave, I fast traveled to Hendraheim immediately. Then, I immediately used Slow Time again and ran inside. Once inside, I ran to the plaque above the door to the downstairs trophy room and placed the axe there. 

Note: I was a Vampire with the Necromage perk and the Bloodworm Helm, which might have affected Slow Time. I also had the Warlock's Ring equiped.

Get rid of this interloper and well be on our way."". Here's what you do. When starting the quest, the game pretty much makes Serena your follower. You can only have one follower at a time. Haha I was NOT happy when I found out what to do because I had to leave j'zargo. It won't work if you tell your follower to stay put somewhere, you have to tell them to part your ways. If they have your items, I believe they stay in their inventory. If you want to be extra safe and take them, then take them. This is not a glitch, its supposed to happen. If you tell your follower to part ways and Serena is still saying it, reload the game or refollow your follower and then unfollow them again. Or look up other solutions.

skyrim,2022,1,"I've been playing Skyrim for all the years it has been on this earth. But those following years never lived up to my very first winter in which I spent hours in my room, white silence outside my window, just walking through Skyrim with this beautiful soundtrack and scenery. You know what I am talking about.

I've recently purchased the Skyrim Special Edition and was excited to play all the DLCs for the very first time! Today I woke up and as I looked outside of my window I saw white fog in the air and crisp frost on the ground. I had nothing planned for this day, immediately felt nostalgia and decided this day would be one of those Skyrim days. 

I spent hours playing and for the first time started the Dawnguard quest! I could not have been happier, honestly. 

Until...
Skyrim did what Skyrim does...

When fleeing the dungeon after freeing Serana (and immediately being bewitched by her), Lydia and her started attacking each other because- reasons. Jealousy, perhaps? As I stood there looking from one woman to another in utter disbelief I felt my perfect day crumble all around me. I knew I had forgotten to save, because I just had been ENJOYING MYSELF! SORRY! Because I didn't want the quest to end and didn't want both of them dead, I killed Lydia in a panic. Idk if Serana is even able to die. I felt horrible. Following stupid sexy Serana out of the dungeon, becoming a vampire lord...it didn't feel good because I had always my brave Lydia in mind, being left to rot in some dungeon, not getting the honourable burial she would have deserved. I couldn't enjoy my game anymore.

...

So I reloaded a save game, am back in Whiterun with Lydia, have no idea about my To Do list.. and can play it all again. As soon as I have the energy again that is. And I think I'll leave Lydia at home next time..

Skyrim, I truly love you. But oh boy do I hate you.

skyrim,2022,1,"I've never got the time to get into modding and I always wanted to ""write"" my own quest for Skyrim. I've been playing around with the idea of writing a Vigilant of Stendarr questline that would be immersive, vanilla-like. I love this faction because they're so unutilized. I'm also aware of other Vigilant mods, like the **Vigilant**, but it's bit too out there for my taste. It stands out too much. My idea was always to write something that would feel like it belongs to the vanilla game.

I've spent last couple of days writing this but sadly won't have the time to finish it. It's already bigger than I expected it to be. It's the first batch and pretty raw; all the dialogues written on the spot, so they could be much improved, they just serve to drive the plot. Idea is that mod revolves around rebuilding the Hall and the Order, similar to the Dawnguard faction. Then it may offer the main questline + numerous side quests, again similar to Dawnguard. Main enemy would be a powerful coven of witches, but player would encounter all sorts of enemies, all related to daedric worship. Also, player will sometimes face moral dillema and options how to end certain quests (kill or spare the enemy).  Rewards are not great, questing is mostly for roleplaying value.

Quest is possible after the destruction of the Hall of the Vigilant.

# Starting the Questline

Visit Rorikstead and find a **Vigilant Gemaine** inside Frostfruit Inn.

Vigilant Gemaine: *I’m with the Vigil of Stendarr. Official business.*

1. **What are you doing here?** *There’s been a rumour of daedric worship here in Rorikstead, but haven’t found any proof. Yet. I’m waiting for Olvir’s return. A fellow Vigilant.*
2. **Where is Olvir?** *Wanted to check an old tower nearby. We’re supposed to meet here but he’s been late. I’m starting to worry.*
3. **Attack on the Hall of the Vigilant.** *Yes. By Stendarr, the Vigil has many enemies. It’s a heavy blow to our order, but we will survive. We always do, it’s in our nature. There are many of us out there, hiding, waiting for a chance to strike back.*

No quest will start yet. To activate the quest, player should visit *Bleakwind Bluff*, nordic tower just northwest of Rorikstead and find Vigilant Olvir’s lifeless body. Player needs to take his Amulet of Stendarr (*Olvir’s Amuet of Stendarr*). Next to him is a body of a dead witch. Player returns to Gemaine.

Vigilant Gemaine: *You wanted something?*

1. **I have found Olvir.** (give his amulet) *Oh no. His amulet. What happened?*
2. **Looks like he died fighting a witch.** *Not just any witch, it seems. Olvir was a good fighter… and I was confindent enough to let him investigate that place alone. Now, we lost another brother. I must go there immediately. Will you come? Could really use a hand right now.*

Player can choose yes or no. If “no”, Gemaine will remain in the inn and disappear from game when player returns. If ""yes"", they will both go to Bleakwind Bluff.

Upon arriving Gemaine will comment: *Stay vigilant, friend. I sense danger.* 

Hagraven and two witches named **Ran** and **Sulie** will attack player and Gemaine. When defeated, Ran will enter dialogue.

Ran: *No more, please. I surrender.* 

1. **What are you doing here?** *We… didn’t want to harm anyone. Inge wanted to learn… from hagravens…*
2. **Who is Inge?** *Leader of our coven.*
3. **Where is she?** *Please, let me go. I haven’t done anything wrong. Inge is the one you want. I just want out of here.*

Player has the option *to let Ran go* or *strike her*. If let her go, Gemaine will instantly kill Ran and comment: *These witches deserve no mercy, remember that, friend.* If player strikes Ran, Gemaine will comment: *Our work is done, for now. You’d make an excellent Vigilant of Stendarr, my friend.*

Gemaine will then start a new dialogue with the player.

Vigilant Gemaine: *We should head back to Rorikstead. There’s foul magic in the air and it makes my stomach turn.*

Once back in Rorikstead, Gemaine will say: *Thank you for your help, friend. The Vigil will remember what you’ve done for us today. Too bad for Olvir, his loss is irreplaceable. I must now go into hiding.*

1. **Where will you go?** *Stendarr’s Beacon. Should be safe there, for now. We must act fast, regroup and regain our strength back, if we intend to fight the evil. Stendarr preserve us.*
2. **Regroup?** *Yes. Our brothers and sisters are out there, hiding. I will find a way of reuniting with them. Nothing else left for me. Listen, you’re always welcome to our sanctuary. Maybe I’ll see you soon.*

Gemaine proceeds to walk to Stendarr’s Beacon.

 

**Rise From the Ashes**

Player can then meet Gemaine at the Stendarr’s Beacon. He is there with three random vigilants. He is pleased to see the player again and talks about rebuilding the order. Dialogue:

Vigilant Gemaine: *Great to see you again. I knew you would come. Stendarr is watching over us, on this day. Time has come to rebuild the Order.*

1. **Rebuilding the Order** Y*es. Longer we wait, stronger our enemy grows. We have great plans but before proceeding, we must find our brothers and sisters.*
2. **Brother and sisters**. *Brother Ulfeim and sister Ravana. I know they’re alive. Their help will be… invaluable. Experienced servants of Stendarr who fought by my side for years. It’s… only… we’re so busy here. Not enough man power.*

Player then has options:

1. Good luck finding them.
2. Maybe I can help you find them? 

If Player chooses first option, Gemain will simply say *thanks*. Choosing second option starts the dialogue:

Vigilant Gemaine: *You know, I’m beginning to wonder if Stendarr himself have sent you here*.

1. **Vigilant Ravana** *She’s a Redguard, grew up in Solitude. Quiet girl, reliable. Days before the attack on the Hall she spoke about going low. Almost as if she knew what’s going to happen. Mentioned something about hiding in Whiterun, blending in, that sort of thing. Listen, if you see a Redguard female in Whiterun, just say “Stendarr’s mercy be upon you”, and if she responds with “for the Vigil has none to spare”, it’s her. Tell her we are not giving up and the Vigil once more requires her service.*
2. **Vigilant Ulfeim** *Former priest who replaced books with the mace after witnessing horrors done by daedra worshippers in the forests around Ivarstead. He owns a home in Ivarstead, I’m sure he lives quietly as priest there.* 

Exiting this dialogue starts the quest **Rise from Ashes**.

Player has to recruit Ravana and Ulfeim, in any order.

Ravana can be found in Whiterun’s Hall of the Dead, dressed as a commoner and servant to the priest of Arkay.

Ravana: *Yes?* 

1. **Who are you?** *Just a simple servant. Nothing else to say.*
2. **“Stendarr’s mercy be upon you”** *For the Vigil has none to spare. I don’t remember your face. You’re new?*
3. **Gemaine sends me. He’s reforming the Vigil.** *Gemaine is alive? Good to hear. But I’m afraid things are worse than we’ve thought.*
4. **What happened?** *I’ve been followed. There’s a woman in Whiterun. Followed me all the way from Dawnstar. Don’t know who is she or what does she want, but she’s after me. Waiting.*
5. **Gemaine waits for you at the Stendarr’s Beacon**. *If I’m to leave Whiterun, I must be sure no one follows me. We still don’t know who we’re dealing with. I have a plan, though.*
6. **What’s the plan?** *I have an old Vigilant uniform here. Wear it around and see if anyone follows you. Or does anything suspicious. Get rid of them and come back to me at once.*

To advance the questline, player needs to wear Vigilant uniform given by Ravana (apprentice robe of Restoration, amulet of Stendarr, steel plate boots and gauntlets). Female NPC named Ersa will spawn at the Bannered Mare. Player needs to enter the inn. Ersa will approach player and start the dialogue.

Ersa: *Oh, you must be a Vigilant of Stendarr?* 

1. **Don’t know what you’re talking about.** *My apologies. I was looking for help.*
2. **Yes. Do you require my assistance?** *Please. My sister is ill, but we’ve no gold to pay for cure. Could you help us? She is outside.*

If player chooses first option, nothing would happen until leaving the city. Ersa will attack the player soon as the player heads out, saying: *thought you could trick me?* Second option will make Ersa lead the player outside Whiterun, towards the Honningbrew Meadery where she will attack together with two other witches. She will comment: *Death to the Vigil*. In both cases, player must defeat the enemy and take a note from Ersa:

*I’ve tracked one of them for days. I could kill her right away but what if she leads me to the rest of the group? Inge would be pleased to find the rest of those wretched witchhunters. Tell her I’ll be back very soon.*

Ravana: *You’re back. Did you discover anything?*

1. **All done. Found this note on her.** *Let me see it. Inge? I should have known.*
2. **You know her?** *Yes. Well… Kinda. Inge is a powerful witch from High Rock. Local chapter had plenty of issues with her. I was in a team tasked to hunt her down. Few years back. She always managed to escape Vigil’s judgement. Looks like she’s decided to hunt the vigilants. Knowing our current weakened state, no doubt.*

Upon exiting dialogue she will comment:

Ravana: *I was bored here anyways. No use of hiding. Meet me at Stendarr’s Beacon. There’s job to be done.* 

Ulfeim can be found in Ivarstead, talking to a NPC Wounded Farmer. He also has a humble home in Ivarstead.

Ulfeim: *I’m sorry. My faith… abandoned me. There is nothing I can do.*

When player starts dialogue he will say:

Ulfeim: *If it’s healing or a council that you seek, you’re in the wrong place, I’m afraid. Gods have abandoned this place…and everyone.* 

1. **Are you Ulfeim?** *Why do you ask?*
2. **We need your help. Come with me.** *What are you talking about? I’m but a simple town healer. A local fool. Leave me.*
3. **Ehm… “Stendarr mercy be upon you”** *Ah. For the Vigil has none. To spare, that is. Khm, yes. Now, how can I help you”*
4. **Gemaine sends me. He needs you.** *Hah. My days with the Vigil are gone, I’m afraid. Stendarr’s embrace left this old fool. I don’t even have the amulet. Lost it while ambushed by that tower… what’s the name. Autumn tower?*
5. **Ambushed? When?** *Just a couple of days ago. Hah, still know how to swing. One of them witches broke the amulet. Surely a sign from Stendarr. My lucky amulet… I left it there. Won’t be needing it anymore.*
6. **Witches are hunting the Vigil. They won’t stop till you’re dead.** *Oh, seems like there’s more to the story? Tell you what. If you find my amulet I’ll consider it a sign from Stendarr. Good luck.*

Player then needs to go to Autumnwatch tower. There will be bodies of two witches but no sign of amulet. A cave bear will spawn and attack the player in front of the tower, player will loot the amulet from its body. Upon return, Ulfeim will comment:

Ulfeim: *My amulet! Can’t believe it’s still there…here. With all the thieves and looters around Skyrim these days. Surely a sign from Stendarr. I’ll head to the Beacon at once. As soon as I wash away this awful stench from my amulet. Reeks of bear’s breath*.

Stendarr’s Beacon is now populated by Gemaine, Ravana, Ulfeim and three generic level 25 Vigilants. When player visits them, they will say:

Ravana: *You’re back just in right time. Gemaine wants to speak to you.*

Ulfheim: *Getting really cold out here.*

Gemain will stand at the top of the Beacon. 

Gemain: *I knew you would come. We have a job to do. But before that, I wanted to ask you something.*

1. **What is it?** *When I was young, I often wondered about gods. And their ways with us, mere mortals. You see, I’m a simple man. Haven’t read many books or studied in colleges. Yet, as a Vigilant of Stendarr I’ve learned more about gods in one day than most of these, so called learned men could in a lifetime in their libraries. Harsh, everyday reality taught me about life, but even more about death. Do you believe that a life spent in faith and service to a god is worth living?*

*Dialogue Options:*  


1. **I believe so**. *Stendarran path is that of constant servitude and sacrifice. I believe that you stand here for a purpose. For a Stendarran cause. Would you dedicate yourself to a path not paved with worldly glory or fame, but with self sacrifice and spiritual quietude?*
2. **Haven’t thought about it yet.** *Of course. Worldly drama leaves no time for a silent look inwards. Within our souls. Come back to me when you feel ready, my friend.*
3. **I don’t have time for this.** *Then I thank you for your help. And may the gods watch over you.*

Choosing option 1 (**I believe so**) will lead to next dialogue:

1. **Yes**. Stendarr is with us today, for we welcome a new brother/sister to our ranks. Serve Stendarr faithfully, and spread his Justice and Mercy equally among all mortals.
2. **Have to think about it.** Take your time friend, but not too long, for enemy is growing stronger. And tomorrow we may not stand here, anymore. 

Choosing option 1 (**Yes**) will make a player join Vigilants of Stendarr. Option 2 (**Have to think about it**) will let player postpone it. 

Choosing option 2 (**Haven’t thought about it yet**) also allows player to delay joining the Vigil. Choosing option 3 (**I don’t have time for this**) will cancel the quest and player won’t be able to join the Vigil.

Upon joining the Vigilants of Stendarr, Gemaine will start next conversation:

Vigilant Gemaine: *Now, let’s discuss further plans. First, we have to rebuild our Hall. Somewhere far from Stendarr’s Beacon, for this place is too familiar to our enemies. After discussing with the others, I think we’ve found the right place. Forests of Haafingar to the far north. I’ll mark it on your map. Meet us there in a week.*

New Hall of the Vigilant will be located halfway between Volskygge and Clearpine Pond. It will appear after 7 in-game days. It’s a standard lodge, similar to the original Hall, with the addition of a single watchtower and small garden. Basement has additional rooms and beds as well as another shrine to Stendarr and a small library section. There will be present Gemaine, now called Keeper Gemaine, Vigilant Ravana, Vigilant Ulfeim and three generic level 25 Vigilants.

End of the quest **Rise From the Ashes**.

After 7 in-game days new Hall is finished. Keeper Gemaine is in the main hall, either eating or praying to Stendarr.

# Main Quest - Light of Stendarr

Keeper Gemaine: *Welcome brother/sister. What do you think of our new Hall? It wasn’t easy setting everything up in this remote area. Wolves constantly harassing workers. But in the end - it was worth it.*

1. **Looks great and safe.** *Great to hear. Although, we may add more layers of defence later. You can never be too safe.  Now, let’s spread the light of Stendarr across the land. I have the right job for you.*
2. **Won’t last long. It’s too remote and vulnerable.** You think so? Ravana seems to think that as well. It’ll serve the purpose, for now. As we get more resources we’ll add more. Don’t you worry about that. But now, I have a job for you.
3. **What needs to be done, Keeper?**

Keeper Gemaine: *We’re spreading our network. I’ve sent our eyes and ears around. Gotta stay in touch with people, look out for them, you know. This is our job. I’ve already received reports of daedra worship. A small cult formed in Morthal. Go there, find our spy - Lucianus. He’ll let you know more*. *You’ll find him in local tavern.*

Keeper Gemaine: *Stendarr be with you.*

Lucianus can be found in Moorside Inn.

Lucianus: Yes, stranger?

1. **Gemaine sends me. I’m with the Vigil.** *I was afraid no one would come. Our men are few and far between. Thank you for coming.*
2. **You know Gemaine?** *Oh yes. I have a long history with the Vigil. I’m not the Vigilant myself, though. Leave the fight for those who are trained. My particular set of skills are used for other means.*
3. **How can I help?** *There are couple of daedra worhippers camped near Morthal. Not the usual kind. Seem to be looking for someone, or something. Don’t know exactly what. But Vigil doesn’t tolerate any kind of daedric worship and prefers to react before it spreads. I’ll mark their camp on your map.*

Lucianus: *Good luck hunting those bastards.*

Player can meet two NPCs in a small camp in the swamp near Morthal. They’re Imperials named Alesius Lorenicci and Valentina Lorenicci, dressed in common clothes and seemingly friendly. Player can just kill them on site or start dialogue with Alesius.

Alesius: *What brings you to the swamps, stranger*?

1. **Just hunting around. And you**? *We’re herbalists from south. Came here in search for deathbell plants but these swamps are far more dangerous than we’ve thought. It might take us a while before we get enough supplies.*
2. **I’m looking for daedra worshippers. Seen anything suspicious**? *Daedra worshippers? Here? Haven’t seen anyone, sorry.* 
3. **Came here to put an end to your vile practices.** *I don’t know what you’re talking about. Please, leave us alone.*

Answering option 1 (**Just hunting around**) will result in next dialogue options:

1. **Maybe I can help?** *Yes, thank you, stranger. If you can bring us some, it would save us lot of trouble.*
2. **Is this enough?** (if player has at least 10 deathbell plants he can just give them away) *Thank you so much, generous stranger. Saved us a lot of trouble.*

Asking about daedra worshippers (Option 2) triggers the next event. If player chooses not to kill them, believing they’re simple herbalists and leaves camp site he will be attacked by two storm atronachs very soon. After defeating them player will be attacked by Alesius and Valentina. Before dying, Alesius will beg for mercy: 

Alesius: *Why…are you doing this? We haven’t done anything wrong. We only follow the voice of our Lord, Mehrunes Dagon. Let us go, show mercy… stranger.*

Player can either deal final blow or release them. Letting them live will make Alesius and Valentina leave campsite and disappear from game. Player returns to Lucianus.

Lucianus: *You’re back. Have you dealt with the daedra worshipper accordingly?*

1. **It is done, both are dead.** *Ah, excellent. My work is done here. Honestly, couldn’t wait to leave this cursed place. Maybe I’ll see you again. Stay Vigilant.*
2. **It is done, both are dead (Lie)** (if player spared couple). *Nice work, Stendarr is pleased. And so will be Gemaine, better return to him with the good news.*
3. **I spared them. They will leave this place for good.** *What? What have you done? Do you even know how difficult it was to find them in the first place? Number of people, my people, involved in the investigation? You were only supposed to put an end to them, it was your only job. Those two… I have to act quickly and find them again. You.. better return to Gemaine, learn the way of the Vigil before it’s too late.* 

Player returns to the Hall and talks to Gemaine. If he killed them (or lied that he did), there will be next dialogue:

Keeper Gemaine: *Hail brother. What news from Morthal?*

1. **Task is done, daedra worshippers are killed.** *Excellent work, vigilant. We must always act quickly before these heretical teachings spread among the innocent people.* 

If player spared them and told the truth to Lucianus:

1. **I have spared the daedra worshippers and let them leave**. **They won’t be back.** *They… won’t be back. But their heretical teachings remain alive, ready to spread across the land, like plague. You’ve done a terrible mistake, my friend.*
2. **They begged for mercy. And haven’t done any harm.** *I know this was your first Vigilant task, so I may forgive you. This time only. However, I must remind you of your promise to Stendarr. Are you sure you can keep it? We have no tolerance to any of the abomination, including the daedra worshippers and there can be no mercy to them. Is that clear?*

Player can answer yes or no:

1. **Yes, Keeper.** *Good. Now, sharpen up. You are a Vigilant. In order to avoid fate of our fallen brothers and sisters, we must be as twice as vigilant and resolute.*
2. **I cannot do this. It’s not right.** *I’m greatly disappointed in you. I told you this was a difficult path to follow. You are a good fighter but lack discipline. I must ask you to leave this Hall and return if you ever change your mind.* (choosing this option will cancel further progress of this questline, but player is not expelled. Player needs to leave the Hall and upon return he needs to talk to Gemaine again. If player chooses to continue main Vigilant questline, Gemaine will send him to Ravana or Ulfeim and tell player to perform minor tasks for them as atonement and after completing at least 2 radiant quests from them, he is allowed to continue main questline).

If player have killed Alesius and Valentina, lied that he killed them or answered option 1 (**Yes**, **Keeper**), he can continue the main questline.

Keeper Gemaine: *Ready for another one? Good. While you we’re away in Morthal I have received news from another one of my men. A priest of Stendarr from Hammerfell, real one - not like our Ulfeim over here - is visitting Whiterun and is interested in opening a chapel in Skyrim, from where he woud offer free healing and councel to all those in need. Running a chapel isn’t cheap nor easy, nor safe in this times. So we would like to offer him our headquarters and would love to have a chapel of Stendarr here. Find the priest - he is staying currently in the temple in Whiterun - and convince him to come here.*

 

1. **Got it.** *Stendarr guide you. Good luck brother/sister.*
2. **Do you know him?** *Not personally, but my men told me he’s a known scholar. Name’s Kamhed. A learned men and a talented healer. Also very zealous. A man of such qualities is needed among us, right now. I’m sure you can convince him to join us.* 

Player must go to Whiterun only to find that Kemhat isn’t in the temple. His note can be found in the temple of Kynareth, saying:

*Went outside to a catch a breath of fresh tundra air. For anyone in need of my service, I’ll be back in short time, Thank you, Kamhed.*

Waiting for Kamhed is pointless, for he is in a need for help. Player needs to go outside Whiterun and save Kamhed from two bandit marauders. They can be found just of the path leading west from Whiterun towards Rorikstead. Player can hear conversation:

Bandit Marauder: *Tundra cotton? Are you mad, old man? I should just stab you for wasting my time.*

Kamhed: *That would be unwise, young man. I can help you clear your sinful past, return to the society…get a job…*

Bandit Marauder: *That’s it. Your dead for mocking us. Die, you old fool.*

Player must then kill two marauders and save Kamhed. When they’re dead, Kamhed will talk to player:

Kamhed: *Such a waste. They were young, full of potential. I should still thank you, kind stranger, for saving my life. My name is Kamhed, I’m a priest of Stendarr.*

1. ***What were you doing out here?*** *Taking a break. I’m staying at the temple of Kynareth, you see. I’m on a sacred mission of establishing a chapel of Stendarr here in Skyrim.*
2. **I’m with the Vigil of Stendarr.** **I need you to come with me.** *Are you? I’ve heard some talk about recent attacks on the Hall of the Vigilant. They say Keeper Carcette is dead. Such tragedy… Oh. You mentioned something about coming with you? Where?*
3. **What was that about the tundra cotton?** *It’s beautiful, isn’t it? Tundra, I mean. Ha ha. I was collecting tundra cotton when those young men approached me, asking for gold. I have no gold, so I offered them tundra cotton. They… didn’t like it.*
4. **Our new Keeper would like you to open a chapel at our Hall.** *Interesting. I wasn’t aware that news spread so fast here in Skyrim. I’ve been here barely for few days… It’s the will of the gods. I’d be happy to. Just tell me where’s the Hall and I’ll be there as soon as possible.*
5. **It’s in the far north, west of Solitude.** *Oh. I’m new to Skyrim. I’m afraid I won’t know how to find it. Can we meet in Solitude, at the temple? Maybe from there you can escort me to the Hall?*
6. **Let’s meet there, then**. *Praise Stendarr. I’ll finish some work here in Whiterun and meet you there in… let’s see.. Two days.*

Player can meet Kamhed at the temple in Solitude after 2 days, however, he will have new requirements. 

Kamhed: *Ah, here you are. Good to see you. I have some bad news, I’m afraid.*

1. **What happened?** *I stayed in Whiterun because I was looking for certain books. For my chapel. I want to build a small, personal library. But, I couldn’t find any of them. Half of these Nords can’t even read! And I just can’t work without my books… you see.*
2. **I’ll help you find them. Let me take you to the Hall first.** *Hmm… I, just.. can’t. I don’t like the idea of being in such an isolated, remote area without my books. It’s bad luck. You have to understand me! I have an idea. Fetch me at least two books and I’ll be ready to go.*
3. **Alright. Which books?** *Here’s the list. I’ll be needing all of them eventually, but for now, just any two will suffice.* 

Kamhed’s Book List note:

*The Exodus, The Black Arts on Trial, The Knights of the Nine, The Oblivion Crisis, Reality &amp; Other Falsehoods, Spirit of Nirn, A Tragedy in Black.* 

Kamhed will stay in Solitute’s temple until player returns with at least two books from the list. Kamhed will then agree to follow the player who needs to escort him to the Hall. Upon arrival, Kamhed will comment:

Kamhed: *Oh, so this is the place? It’s so… serene. And remote. Just the perfect place for my retirement ha ha.*

Gemaine will be thankful: *Praise be Stendarr. You made it! Kemhad will be of great value in this place. Trust me. I’ll arrange with him about the chapel thing. Meanwhile, have some rest, or if you have time, talk to Ravana, she may have a task for you. Thank you again, my friend.*

Player needs to talk to Ravana who has a job for a player.

Vigilant Ravana: *Oh you’re back. Gemaine keeping you busy as usual. Well, he’ll be busy with Kamhed now. I have a job for you. As you can see, Vigilants rarely have a time for respite.*

1. **What can I do for you?** *There are two brothers, mercenaries from Hammerfell, employed by the Legion in their war against the Stormcloaks. Nothing unusal there, of course. Until some legionaries discovered something… very disturbing about them.*
2. **Let me guess. Daedra worship?** *There’s more to it. It has been discovered that they’re followers of Namira. And on more than one occasion were found munching on dead stormcloaks, after the battle. They’re fierce warriors but obviously very deranged. And thus, need to be stopped.*
3. **Shouldn’t Legion deal with them?** *They left the service and are currently in hiding. Besides, Legion is, as you can imagine, very busy with the ongoing war. So they asked us to solve the problem.*
4. **Where can I find them?** *Go to Solitude and speak to a soldier who was last to see them. Poor guy suffers from trauma after witnessing them devouring a wounded soldier alive. He might tell you more about it. Just a word of caution. These guys are elite warriors. If you do find them, approach with caution. We need you alive, friend.*

Player should go to temple in Solitude and find an Imperial soldier named Arvinus sitting inside.

Arvinus: *Yes?*

1. **I’m here for the Redguard mercenaries.** *You must be very good if you gonna face them by yourself. Those guys cleaved through dozens of stormcloaks like it’s nothing. They served in my unit. Seeing them fight was… unbelievable. I thought we gonna end the war in a month. But then, one night… I went behind our camp and saw them. Kneeling over a halfdead stormcloak, mouth full of flesh, and guts. Faces covered in blood.. Poor fellow couldn’t even scream with his guts sticking out…*
2. **What happened next?** *They just grinned and offered me a taste. Like it’s nothing. “In Namira’s name” they whispered. I… I was scared. More than ever. And I spent my whole life in the war. By gods, even in war there is honor. But this.. Pure madness. Madness…*
3. **Where are they now?** *I kept quiet, fearing their wrath, letting them feast. But the rumour spread. Others were seeing too. Word reached higher officers. Legate Rikka herself reacted. So they left the unit, without a single word. But… I fear they’re near. I fear…*
4. **It’s okay. Tell me.** *Go to our camp. I know you will be able to find them. Question is, do you want to.*

Player has to visit a small Imperial Legion camp in the forests north of Solitude. Camp is relatively small, two big tents and three small ones. Player will soon find out that something is wrong with it. There are human bones in some of the tents, and a pile of blooded stormcloak and imperial corpses just behind the camp. There are three Imperial soldiers present: Caius, Rutus and Aspiuli. All three acting quite unfriendly. Player is able to talk to Caius.

Rutus: *No. Not today.*

Aspiuli: *Feeling hungry? I do.*

Caius: *I think you’re lost, stranger.*

1. **I’m looking for Redguard mercenaries.** *Do you. Better leave. This camp is cursed.*
2. **I need to find them first.** *Oh yes. Why don’t you sit, warm up by the fire. Let Rutus and Aspiuli bring you something to eat.*

Player has the option:

1. **Thanks, I could use a hot meal.** *Of course. Nothing like a freshly cooked soup to warm up belly. Join us, my friend.*
2. **Not hungry, thank you.** *Are you sure? We have something special on the menu today. Isn’t that right, boys?*

If player chooses option 1 (**Thanks I could use a hot meal**) he will be given a bowl of soup. Upon consuming it will damage his health, stamina and magicka, due to being made with human flesh, thus poisoned. Caius will laugh and ask if you would like more. At this point player can either choose more (and thus poison himself further) or refuse, making three imperials aggressive and attack the player. Choosing *no* will make them attack the player right away.

Choosing option 2 (**Not hungry**) will make Caius say: *Well, that’s too bad. We are starving. For some fresh meat.* They will attack player then.

In any case, player will be forced to kill all three imperial guards who are obviously turned to cannibalism and went mad. Player can then take a journal from Caius’ body:

*Dear Erika*,

*A small unit under Captain Galius was dispatched north of Solitude. In the middle of nowhere, better to say. I believe this to be a penalty for captain’s recent argument with Legate Vali. Just my luck. We have nothing to do here except fighting terrible ice winds and starving wolves…*

*Something must be wrong. We are left alone in this camp without additional supplies. Two mercenaries from Hammerfell keep leaving the camp almost every day but nobody knows where to. They’re strange but no one wants to, or dares to ask them. They’re well fed and surprisingly calm. Captain is cursing the gods…*

*This camp is cursed. It must be. We’re almost out of food. Some are eating wolves we killed days ago. And it’s all because of those damn mercenaries, people say. They are strange. Men disappearing in the night, only to be found half eaten in the morning. Luckily frost keeps the bodies from rotting or we would all die from the smell. No one has the strength to even give them a proper burial.*

*So many are gone missing. Albertus, Raggni, Valetian… and everone in the camp is hungry.* 

*Captain Vali was found dead this morning, in his tent. Heart ripped open, guts hanging out of his stomach. Night guard Brennus was then caught eating captain’s remains, behind the tent. Like a wild animal. Gods have abandoned us. Legion has abandoned us.* 

*So, it turned out they’re cannibals. All this time. Mercenaries from Hammerfell. And somehow they spread this unnatural disease to the others. We have all tasted… my dear Erika…* 

*I grow tired. Sleepless nights. I miss Cyrodiil. I wonder how are you, my beautiful sweet Erika? Are you still waiting for me? How warm and soft, you must be.*

*Ondranu and Ruveem leave the campsite each day, only to return each night to feast with the others. Stormcloaks, our own men, it doesn’t matter anymore. Arvinus is missing and now there are only three of us left. We accepted our faith. Namira has taken over.* 

Soon after defeating soldiers, two Redguard mercenaries will aproach the camp. They are called Ruveem and Ondranu and will attack the player right away. After defeating them player should go back to the Hall.

Vigilant Ravana: Have you dealt with the mercenaries from Hammerfell?

1. **They are dead and will not spread the disease of cannibalism unto others.** Good. You managed to defeat some of the finest, most elite Redguard mercenaries out there. I have to admit I was praying for your return. Good to see you back. 

 

**-Random quotes-**

**Keeper Gemaine**:

*Although I grew up in Skyrim, I miss the forests of High Rock. Funny, isn’t it.*

*We must stay sharp if we ought to survive.*

*Stendarr spoke in my dreams last night. He is watching over us.*

*Stendarr preserve us.*

**Priest Kamhed**:

*I was a crusader in my youth. Damn good one.*

*We need more books around here.*

(further ideas: quest involving renegade vigilants and dawnguard who secretly worship Meridia; chapel of Stendarr next to the Hall will be visited by pilgrims, restocking alchemical ingredients and brewing potions as side quests; patroling different areas with other vigilants). Generic vigilants as followers; Also a fully voiced follower (maybe a knight of Stendarr visitting from High Rock who is on a pilgrimage).

skyrim,2022,1,"Warning: While I used to play Skyrim a lot back in 2011, my knowledge of TES is not very good, so please forgive me if I made some mistakes. (But please let me know!)

Tbh creating a backstory for my char is actually quite new to me (modding is more of my interests), but after years of modding, troubleshooting and testing I was finally ready for a playthrough and thought I would try something new.

I creared a dunmer follower of Mephala (Wintersun) I joined the Thieves Guild.  I didn't realize that was out of character. As a refugee in Skyrim my char was determined to make connections with powerful factions that could help me survive and eventually rise to the top. I remembered that other Dunmer were part of the Thieves' guild. (Ravyn Imyan was a formal Morag Tong member and he didn't have problems joining the guild)

I forgot that they railroad you into becoming a nightingale, but once I saw that sweet sweet armor (made great again with Reliquary of Myth and Frankly HD Nightingale Set) I couldn't go back. I figured it would be like another daedric quests, where I could just say that my char is willing to offer his help to the daedra to get more powerful. RP wise I just avoided doing quest for the 4 corners of the House of Troubles and I thought that would be enough,

But then, at the last minute, in Nightingale Hall where you can ask Karliah what it means to be a nightingale, I was reminded 1) Being a Nightingale actually means selling your soul to Nocturnal, not temporarily lending your service like all the other daedric quests and 2) Nocturnal is an enemy of Azura. Which is a problem since 1) Azura is part of the 'Good Daedra' and 2) I already did the black star quest where I chose to purify the star (A decision I would never have made if not for rp reasons)

Now, I either sacrifice my build, or I retcon, or hopefully, I can find some workaround from some loremongers here ;)

Im level 19 with an elven bow with elven arrows and smithing 50 so its upgraded a bit. Im also on the regular difficulty. After playing a few missions i found that just putting away the bow and pulling out a dagger gets the job done way more quickly. Also the 3x damage boost doesnt seem to do much. It still does barely any damage against the higher lvl draugr. I feel like just using my sword and shield and hacking and slashing their flesh away would work twice as fast. But everyone says how incredibly OP it is, so i feel like im definately just missing something. Is there a certain strategy im supposed to use? Certain arrows? I do find the build fun either way and will probably continue to play as the stealth archer but i really wanna know why its considered OP.",2022-01-03 21:15:20
skyrim,2022,1,"Hi there, I've been planning on doing a Skyrim playthrough exclusively while on discord with my girlfriend. (We're on discord a tonne in our free time) and i wanted to include her in this a bit. So I've decided i wanted to give her a list of commands she can either mess with me, or help me out. Every certain amount of time.(say like 3 to 10 minutes?) As in maybe she can spawn certain monster, reduce my carryweight for a certain amount of time. Give me buffs or debuffs etc. All to her choosing. So i came here to ask, what are some good things for on this list of her abilities??",2022-01-03 21:17:03

skyrim,2022,1,"Now like most of us on this reddit we've played skyrim in one way or another in the last ten years. With the Anniversary edition coming out I've decided to dive back with a fresh character. Now my main issue with the last few runs I've done is I tend to do too much. Spread my skills and Perks around into combat, magic and Stealth than I feel like I've wasted my time. Now this time I've decided to do something more straightforward but I'm just looking for advice on if this build seems fun or interesting.

Race Orc or Dunmer (Simply are my favorite races to be)

Primary skills
Smithing
Heavy Armor
Block
One Handed
Archery
Sneak
Enchanting

7 Major skills leveled to 100 will get me Level 50ish which is to me what I want. Now my thing is this, how's Sword and Board? should I switch to dual wield or two handed? invest into some magic? something like illusion? drop Archery for more magic like conjuration? I just am looking for a really good jack of all trades kinda build. I'm open to feedback here and willing to Swap things out.",2022-01-03 21:37:25

skyrim,2022,1,"I have done a few quests and now when I goto whiterun these people excuse me of spreading lies about being a Dragonborn then curb stomp my teeth out then choke me to death on them. 

I am guessing a need to level up to beat them but there is no way I can find to level up. I have no money I spent it all on spells. The worst part is I even lowered the difficulty to apprentice and still its impossible. I am level 10 with 20 destruction, or my melee is iron armour and near Nord sword.

Its got to the point where I have no clue what I am doing and I am not just gonna roam about the map killing wolfs. I have never really played Skyrim before so I don't know much about the game.

**Can you not just do quest after quest? Have you gotta roam about killing stuff and discovering items in-between each quest to make sure your a good level. I know about upgrading armour and weapons but have you gotta get levels outside of quests aswell?** 

**Is there a way to level up destruction that's easy? I tried blasting my horse like at the YT videos say but that pisses him off and he starts attacking me.

skyrim,2022,1,"So, last night I was doing the Thieves' Guild questline, and at some point Lydia stopped following me - the game dismissed her as a companion. Unfortunately, I just assumed she would come back after the quest because that happened several times in the past. This time, she was actually dismissed.

I know she could end up in Breezehome or Dragonreach, but despite multiple days passing, she's not there. I have not run into a courier letting me know she died, so she's alive somewhere.

I went back to the snow dungeon where I started that quest with Mercer, and she's nowhere to be found. I retraced my steps from that dungeon all the way to Whiterun, hoping to run into her and I never found her along that entire path.

The reason I really want to look for her is that she was wearing some pretty good Dragon armor and I also gave her the mace of Molag Bal with a bunch of soul gems. I absolutely don't want to lose that mace :( I need to find her.

I'm on Xbox Series X. How do I find her?",2022-01-03 22:47:32

Now I got the anniversary edition for Christmas and as usual I was going to do the thing I have always done. But in the beginning I follow Hadvar instead of Ralof out of Helgen. 

Now I went to do my usual thing, everything was fine until after the battle of white run. I go to meet Ralof by the fort with the men to free the prisoners. But he’s not there, so I went ahead thinking he would show up later. 

I freed the prisoners and overtook the fort. I go to report to Ralof and once again he is no where to be found. I checked all the places he would be and he is not there. I notice on my map The mark for the white run military camp is gone. I thought that was odd. 
 And so come to find out by the power of google, that since I didn’t follow him out of of Helgen the games believe he is AWOL or dead. therefore for he no longer is a character I can interact with rendering siding  with the Stormcloaks  quest line after  the Jagged crown line completely and utterly dead.
