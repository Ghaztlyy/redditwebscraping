leagueoflegends,2020,1,"Enemy team has champions like Ekko, Talon, Garen, Akali or any other popular high damage champion.

You just get one shot by the Ekko and Talon. Garen chases you down and by the time you kite him to 70% health he's already killed you. Akali also one shotting you. I buy Guardian Angle. That helps me once every what, 3 minutes?

I might as well not even participate in team fights against champions like that. They simply wait for me to appear and proceed to delete me from the game faster than I can blink my eyes. Doesn't matter if I'm hiding in bush, behind my team, under my own tower. I just get deleted.",1577836837

leagueoflegends,2020,1,"So i decided to climb to master tier in season 11.
Im currently sitting in diamond 4 as the season ends.
Climbing to diamond has not been a big challenge for me in this seson, its was rather a challenge of time.

I have had enough and went to another server (eune-&gt;euw) but the same thing happened.

Currently maining jungle as a hecarim player but learnt some other champions(rek'sai,lee sin,graves etc..) in the preseason to further my knowledge about pathing, match ups and so on.

So im asking you guys here on reddit. Can you give me any tips or advice to improve myself as a player/jungler and possibly climbing to master tier at the end of 2020?

Thanks in advance",1577837097

leagueoflegends,2020,1,"Title. As it stands right now, there's a giant gap from early November all the way til late January where NA and EU fans and teams have basically nothing to do. For NA fans it's even worse since our teams always get eliminated early anyways (kill me please thanks). 

All-stars only takes up 3 days in early December and is basically the furthest thing from a **real** competitive event. On top of that only a few players actually get to participate. 

In China and Korea, the KeSPA and Demacia Cups take up a big chunk of that dead time during preseason, providing teams with real competitive practice while also giving fans something interesting to watch. The bracket format allows all teams in each league to participate, including academy teams in Korea. 

I think this format would be especially beneficial in NA and EU where BO3 or BO5 experience is few and far between. We'd get to see previews for all the new rosters. A tournament like this could also include academy teams from NA or regional league teams from EU. 

Idk what the community's opinion on this would be, but I'd personally love to see Riot do something like this for next year.

Edit: For people talking about player rest time - KeSPA and Demacia only last about a week and a half, less for teams that don't make it all the way to the end. Some teams also play subs (FPX for example).",1577837830

leagueoflegends,2020,1,"For this new year, I say that we go with new year, new game, and we completely remove flaming from the game. Yes its stressful, but never in the history of the game has calling someone a dickhead or a noob immediately made them play like they're in challenger. Its getting old, so if we can remove the toxicity from league, we can make the game fun again, and play it like normal people, instead of addicts that cant help but play another. Its honestly upsetting how many people still flame, and the happiness from getting a game with nice teammates is immeasurable because of the state it's been left in.

For new year, I promise I will never flame another player for acting a certain way. Theres no point, and it doesn't help, so instead I'll try and give helpful tips, like a nice person. We dont need to act like the toxic apes the public see us as, so just be nice. If it comes to it, just /muteall every game, and never say a word.

leagueoflegends,2020,1,"I recently started playing in solo lanes because I was a support main.

I realised in a game ,( I was playing pantheon mid into a yasuo) that I was waiting for so long to engage. My mindset is that I have to meet certain criteria in order to engage, in this matchup, it was so important that
-Yasuos passive shield was gone
-Yasuos windwall was down
Every time I wanted to engage both of these criteria had to be met because I thought that if he has passive shield he would negate some extremely important damage that would win me the 1v1.

I thought if he had windwall he would use it to block the killing blow of my fully charged q.

Often now I find myself doing this, making conditions for myself to go in. But I want an outside opinion as to if this is too limiting as it can take up to a minute to reach the right conditions and by that point I may have just been poked out of lane. I don't think I'm faker and I'm not bragging about my amazing strategy that's probably already used by everyone else, I just want to know if  it is too limiting for me in a solo lane",1577840865

Realistically you have yasuo irelia akali who have good potential but for the avg player which is btw 90% of this reddit, imense room for error. Sure their flashy plays seem unfair but realistically HOW OFTEN do you get an Akali/ire/yas to be that feared 1 v 9 carry solo killing a team ?


Then come the thicc quadruplr of morde nasus darius ilaoi who are basically ""get 6 win"".

Does it realistically feel fair when nasus runs you down with Qs and a pointclick wither ?

Is it fun when ilaoi grabs your soul and forces you to play league of tentacles ?

Is it fun when morde can legit miss parts of his kit yet still get carried by his passive ?

And darius ? I have seen chally players who had advantages against darius like tf or some koreans and one misplay and 0/2 darius beat 2/0 irelia  or camille

So idk... i cant imagine how difficult champs can like be more frustrating than literally right click bots or champs who spam abilities on CD hoping one hits and there goes your lane


Ofc an adc/mage player would feel frustration dealing with champs that can get to them/ avoid skills they throw...but sometimes think about the others who might want to play a melee into darius or an AS champ like Irelia vs nasus or some melee imobile thing into ryze...",1577850568

leagueoflegends,2020,1,"In this post i want to look at what may happen in the future for Runetera.

Since the major Lore Retcon that removed the League of Summoners from cannon I've been noticing the lore of Runetera moving towards a very large event. Particularly, a battle. 

**Keep in mind this is all theory that i have constructed by digging deep into the lore of Runetera. Weather or not this event happens is up to Riot and their Lore team.** 

Lets start with Targon. Its peak is where, so far, all the Aspects of Targon have appeared. These aspects are: Diana, Aspect of the Moon. Leona, Aspect of the Sun. Pantheon, Aspect of War. Taric, Aspect of the Protector. Zoe, Aspect of Twilight. 

Of what the Aspects know of the coming event. 

Diana, within the temple of Lunari, saw a battle painted on the walls, of gold and silver warriors fighting an unending horde of monsters while the sky rained comets. She also has fragment memories from previous hosts of the aspect, though incomplete. 

Leona has complete knowledge of what to come, as her Aspect memories are unbroken, though we don't know what she knows as it is not explained in the lore text, only that she wont speak about it, she will only speak of what she knows to Diana. 

Pantheon, fully controlled by the Aspect and not Atreus, hunted Darkin specifically. After the Aspect fell to Aatrox, Atreus mortal will kept him alive. He may have knowledge of what the true enemy is, his mind having been in contact with the mind of the Aspect. but with the Aspect itself and a conscious being, dead, Atreus wont have direct access to those memories like Leona or Diana, nor does he appear to be seeking them out, aside from hunting them as beings of great power. 

Taric, appears to know the full purpose of the aspects. it is directly stated in his lore that he stands as the protector of Valoran against the void. 

Zoe as the current oldest host appears to know the most, and appears to have a close relationship with Aurelion Sol. 

As the current situation, all Aspects aside from Diana with her broken memories appear to be keenly aware that the Void is the enemy. 

Now we look at Aurelion Sol. While under Targons control, he was forced to fight the creatures of the Void and seal the Void Rifts they came through. Currently Targon can barely control him. If he breaks free of them it is uncertain weather or not he will partake in repelling the void from Runeterra, as he both despises Targon, though that may simply be Targon Prime and not the residents of Mount Targon, and his arrogance may keep him from caring about protecting the world he considers insignificant. However, he does have a quote ""Darkness is my only true enemy."" Which could simply refer to a lack of stars in the sky, but also could be a nod the the Void, as in the short story 'Twin Dawns' he does note that only something highly intelligent could have made the rift in which the Voidborn come through. Suggesting a much vaster power than that we have seen exists within the Void. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now lets look at the void itself, as we have mentioned it enough. 

Starting with the Watchers. The Watchers are from the Void. They appear to be the only intelligent entities to come from the Void. They created the Voidborn in order gather information on the material world. Their world destroying intent is stated in the Void lore page. Their original attempt was in the Freljord where they turned humans into immortal Iceborn servants. Avarosa led the rebellion against the Watchers which led to their being sealed in True Ice below the Howling Abyss. This seal is slowly fading over time however. In the meantime the Voidborn are their eyes, ears, and hands. 

The Void currently breaks through mostly in Shurima, which had large rifts open up during the rebellion of Icathia. Shurima spent many years fighting to seal these rifts. Many ascended (artificial aspects) died doing this, those that survived where permanently scared, physically and mentally. 

&amp;#x200B;

Looking briefly into Shurima.

With the deaths of many Ascended during the Void war and even more during the Darkin war that followed the death of Azir, only Nasus and Renekton appear to remain of the god like warriors capable of fighting the Voidborn, and even then, Renekton has gone insane and will not be of any help. Nasus who remained largely out of the Darkin war remains probably the only Ascended warrior that can be relied upon to aid Targon, who gave Shurima the technology for ascension in the first place. Yes Azir has returned but will probably only ever take to the battlefield if his people are directly under threat. However, new ascended may come to being as the Sun Disk is now functioning again. 

The Darkin, while once servants of Shurima will probably be absent from the battle as they no longer have the same goal. In fact the Darkin are more likely to side with the Watchers, as at least Aatrox desires world destruction. 

&amp;#x200B;

Who else might be at the battle. 

As it is noted in this [Swains Prophecies post](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/eho2i1/swains_prophecies_taking_a_look_again_at_swains/), Swain knows that the Void has ""learned to be alive."" Noxus also borders Shurima, a hot spot for Void Rift activity, as well as the location where Rek'Sai is building a Void Rift. It is possible that Swain may have Noxus partake in the battle. 

Freljord is the location where the Watchers are sealed. Lissandra knows that there is a clock on how long she can keep them sealed. It is entirely possible that of the 3 factions, she will preempt the event of a large scale Void attack and send military units to the battle. Accounting for travel time and being late to the battle wont be an issue as she will know before everyone else. Weather the other 2 factions in Freljord will also send troops to the battle is unknown. If the battle is in Shurima none of the 3 may even partake in the battle for fear of having to deal with the Watchers directly at the Howling Abyss. 

Kassadin and Malzahar are both guaranteed to be at the battle, as Kassadin hunts Malzahar, and Malzahar is aiding the Watchers by opening Rifts. Kai'Sa will likely be there as she currently roams Shurima hunting Voidborn. 

&amp;#x200B;

I could probably go on but i have already spent a large amount of time writing this block of text. I would like to see some discussion in the comments as i am always interested in what other people think the direction the Lore is going. Of course i havent mentioned Ionia, the Shadow Isles, Piltover or Zaun in this because they don't currently appear to be connected to this event. 

Thank you for reading. I am looking forward to reading any comments.",1577856568

leagueoflegends,2020,1,"""It is time to make the final match, which was imagined daily, a reality.""

Original Article Author: Yoon Min-sup, a reporter for the Kookmin Ilbo

Translation: Raptor (DRX_Raptor)

Editor: Julia

The copyright holders of this article are the Kookmin Ilbo (Naver), and it is not written by me, but by the Kookmin Ilbo. I translated this with their permission and I am thankful to them.


Kim Hyuk-kyu, DragonX’s (DRX) adc - ""Deft"", has set his sights on the League of Legends World Championship. Kim Hyuk-kyu, who is preparing for the 2020 season with Yeong-gun (very young players), shook his head, saying, ""it feels like I am in high school again"". He expressed his expectations for the next season, saying that ""the growth of the newcomers is scary. (Pyosik and Keria)""

DRX beat Spear Gaming 2-0 in the first round of the quarterfinals in the ""2019 LoL KeSPA Cup ULSAN"" at Nexon Arena in Seocho-dong, Southern Seoul on Monday. DRX, which advanced to the second round of the quarterfinals, will face DAMWON Gaming on the 31st of December.

Deft, who met with the Kookmin Ilbo after the match, did not hide his expectations for new players, saying he still has a lot to improve. He praised ‘Pyosik’ Hong Chang-hyon and ‘Keria’ Ryu Min-Seok, saying, ""These young, hardworking players can do anything.""

Q. You ended up winning the first round of the quarterfinals, the SPG match.

Deft: The first game revealed all our shortcomings parts in lanning and team fighting. There is a lot to be improved. We were behind in kills, but the main objective for us was to have a good game. The main objective was not obtained, because we messed up lane assignments. Even in the dragon fight, we often lost because we did not hold the correct formation nor angle of approach for the team fights. In the second game, the choice to summon Rift Herald botlane was our biggest mistake. Other than that, I think I’ll know when I watch the games again.

Q. The KeSPA Cup is also a competition to boost teamwork.

Deft: Our team has nothing that could be called teamwork yet. The jungler and support of our team are complete rookies. Teaching the basics of team fights to the new players should be prioritised. I think it was a team effort that they've mastered the basics. These players learn fast. I think young, hardworking players like them can do anything.

Q. Is there anything else you want to get from the KeSPA Cup besides your score?

Deft: I've won KeSPA Cup once, and I've also been eliminated right away before. Each experience had its merits. When I won, I took confidence and momentum. When I was eliminated, I could realize the seriousness of the situation. Personally, I think it helped me learn when I was eliminated.

Q. Unlike last year, you are the only veteran player on the team. Do you feel the difference in roles?

Deft: Last year, our team members had a lot of experience overall. They were about my age. So, each of us played a role. However, the players are all young this year. It's been a long time since I was in high school, and I think I'd feel like that if I went to school. It’s very fun to watch team members play well among themselves.

Q. What is your goal for the 2020 season?

Deft: Personally, I want to find the right style for the team and perform that style. This year, I had many happy memories, but I missed opportunities to win. This year's team members are very likely to grow. I want to do my best and go to the final round of the League of Legends World Championships. I've only imagined myself on the stage of finals every day. I think it's time to make it a reality.

Q. HLE mainly used non-AD carry strategy, and they utilized botlane Irelia in today's game.

Deft: I don't think any of the current AD Carry champions will have much impact on the game except for Miss Fortune subsequently non-AD carry is a trend that appears a lot. I am also playing this and that in scrims and SoloQ games. I can play them if the opportunity presents itself.

Q. The next opponent in the match is DWG. The team has something to pay back when it comes to the World Championships selection.

Deft: Actually, today’s game wasn’t easy. That's why the match against DWG will be a good gauge of our current performance. I'll do my best to prepare. I hope it will be a game that has a lot to teach us.",1577864737

leagueoflegends,2020,1,"When they're just wrong, or not as good as their opponent. 

This topic has been brewing in the back of my head for a while now, as the term has become a bit of a hot button for the community. 

According to the ""Summoner's Code"" Intentional Feeding, or Inting, is dying to the enemy team on purpose to grief your teammates. This is reportable, and if someone is doing it you should definitely take the time to do so after the game. 

The problem is the community has started to use the term for anyone who is taking a fight that they know that person will lose. You see the enemy champion with multiple kills, your teammate walks up and get slapped down, again. You accuse them of inting. They vote no at 15. They vote no at 20. Your lead goes out the window in the face of a super fed enemy carry and the game turns into a 30 minute slog that ends with you all screaming at each other in post lobby. You report your teammate for inting, but nothing ever comes of it but bad feelings all around. 

Sound familiar?

Consider this instead. 

Your teammate does not know the matchup very well. This is the first game or the day, or their 15th game of the day. Maybe they've been awake for 5 minutes or more than 24 hours. Maybe their main was banned, or they're trying out a new champion. Maybe the cat won't stop jumping on the keyboard, or their roommates are screaming at each other.

Maybe they just hit a power spike, or finished an item. Maybe the first few kills were because of jungle interference, lag, or misplay. Maybe they saw a misplay, maybe they thought the enemy was alone and they had man advantage. 

Maybe that teammate was just wrong about the situation and didn't know better. Maybe they didn't know an alternative way to solve the problem but keep fighting and try to win the next fight, and the one after that, and the one after that. 

Maybe they keep trying to dig themselves, and the team, out of a hole of their own creation. Maybe they realize some or all of this, and they're not saying anything for a reason. Maybe they're trying really, *really* fucking hard to win but the enemy champion is just better than them at every turn. Maybe they misplayed once or twice and if the game goes to 35 minutes instead of 30 they'll come back...

... but they're so damn demoralized by their teammates accusing them of ***purposefully killing themselves*** to give the enemy team the win and trying to /ff at every turn that they're not going to see a late game team fight. Even if they did, one or more of their teammates is so tilted at them that they straight up don't want to play the game any more. 

Maybe that person is depressed, and you don't realize it but you're accusing them of committing suicide by proxy. 

\------

Got a little heavy there at the end, but I think I've made my point yeah? Call it feeding, call it dying too much, maybe take the time to provide some advice or go group with them to prevent further deaths.

But don't call it Inting. That's against the Summoner's Code for a reason.",1577866620

\- If I let her engage, she would again stun me unitl her combo was finished and she could dash away

He's considered borderline troll pick and people flame you for picking him. Yet he has continually received multiple nerfs over the years, to the point where his shrooms do 0 damage unless you have at least 2 completed items.

You really want to tell me that Teemo is more annoying and anti-fun than something like Kennen or Quinn top? I call bullshit. The Teemo hate has become a meme at this point, there are way more annoying champs.

leagueoflegends,2020,1,"Let's discuss what makes a kit OVERLOADED. It's a term people like to throw around, but it's generally just used to mean that a champion has more than one strength. While there is some merit to the accusations for many champions, there are also many others for whom the idea is just ridiculous. This post is intended to clear up the confusion between ""overloaded"" and ""overpowered.""

Let's start by talking about what it means for a champ to be ""overloaded."" The existence of champion overload implies two concepts: a.) That champions have some sort of ""load"" that is borne by their kit, and b.) that a champion who bears more than their share negatively impacts balance. Perhaps the best example of an overloaded kit is release Azir. While he was not exactly *overpowered,* his kit carried significantly more weight than the kits of other champions. His laning was dominant and high-pressure, with superior range and inescapable harass shutting all melee mids out of the meta, and his mobility keeping him safe from incoming ganks while threatening a dive if the opponent got too low contesting farm. On top of that, he was a hard-scaling hyper carry with insane damage potential, and he hit that spike with just two items thanks to his CDR passive. And then on top of *that,* he was a playmaker who could demolish an entire enemy team with the Shurima Shuffle. And then, on top of *that*, he had the ability to shove towers down if left alone. 

What this effectively meant was that not only did Azir fill the role of his toplaner and support as splitpusher and initiator, he could do both within the same game while also filling the role of his ad carry as a hyper scaling win condition and tower pusher.

Now let's take a look at Pyke. He's lane dominant, with good sustain and slipperiness combined with cc. In teamfights, he can make important picks and chain-kill enemies with his ultimate. However, the hats he wears end there. He has no wave clear, no damage threat onto tanks, and is highly threatened by enemy CC due to his nature as a melee assassin. While he may FEEL overloaded due to being unpokeable in lane while scaling hard, he only carries so much of the game's load. 

Similarly, while Akali has a ton of mobility and seemingly tacked-on stealth mechanics, she has low playmaking ability in teamfights beyond diving for the ADC, and does not threaten towers in a splitpush. Zed is very similar in this way. Both champions may be a little overtuned in terms of damage numbers, but they certainly do not wear nearly as many hats as Azir did. 

In a lot of ways, ""overloaded"" has come to mean ""I died to this and it felt unfair."" And to be clear, there is a lot of merit to that. But let's be clear: Akali shitting out lethal damage from stealth over the course of 5-6 seconds is unfair, not overloaded. Pyke yanking you out of lane to get demolished is annoying, not overloaded. Overloaded means a champion wears a lot of hats - playmaker, guardian, hyper carry, midgame carry, lane bully, tank, assassin, hook, splitpusher - NOT that a champion has a lot of mechanics. Jhin has a lot of different interlocking pieces to his kit, but his hats are well-defined and there are too many things he simply cannot do. As opposed to champs like Azir or Lee Sin with fewer mechanics but who checked most if not all of the boxes on that list in their respective primes. 

Let's not forget it was Riot themselves who introduced the term ""overloaded."" It's ridiculous to assume that they are blithely introducing more and more overloaded champions in defiance of their own language for talking about them. Let's put the blame where it really lies: overpowered interactions and overtuned numbers that make newer champions incredibly frustrating to have to play against.",1577874369

League really feels like a massive step up community wise even if some things feel lackluster caugh caugh *THE CLIENT*. 


I don't want this to be another ad for what I'm trying to do but I really wanted to say something about this because I don't think Riot or the League community gets enough credit especially from other MOBA community's.

leagueoflegends,2020,1,"Starting this off by saying I realize most players probably aren't like me. 

I am the type of player who likes to main one champ/role for a few months at a time before hopping onto something else. A short-term one trick. I started with Irelia (the patch she was released), then Poppy, Sona, Janna, Maokai, Brand, Lux, Soraka, etc. Whenever I hopped to a new champion, I would typically buy all the skins available for that champion at the time. Actually, a new skin release plus being bored with current champ was often the reason I hopped every few months. 

However, with this new skin system, my collector's OCD can not be satisfied. Almost every new skin comes with limited availability chromas, boarders, and icons. For whatever reason (again, prob OCD) I don't like picking up a new champion with skins I can not obtain. This used to only be a few champions out of the 140+, but now it's becoming almost every champion who gets a new skin, especially skins released during events with passes. 

I originally though that although this was annoying, I would, at most, need to wait one year before getting any chromas/boarders I missed in the past. However now with the winter skin chromas not returning this year, it seems like some champions will require 2+ years of waiting if I want to gather all of there skins/chromas. :/

The current system makes me not want to buy RP at all, because I'd rather not buy anything than only be able to buy a piece of something. 

TLDR: I wish we could get some normal skins without weird limited time shit tied to them like we used to. It feels impossible to complete a ""collection"" for any one champion unless said champ is a new release. The boarders, limited chromas, locking icons behind bundles, etc is making it harder and harder to swipe my card to support this game.

It's not rare to find myself in a game with 2-3 people who aren't even level 30 yet, and I understand if there's a higher level premade, but that's not always the case.

I just played a game where my team was me level 240, 2 level 100-something, 1 level 50 and one 24 against a team of 3 lvl 200+, 1 100+ and a lvl 40. 

How is that fair? None in my team were premade while the three higher leveled in the other one were.

I've been finding games very difficult to enjoy because there's such discrepancy out of nowhere. I thought normal games had some kind of hidden mmr to keep the levels balanced, but this is ridiculous.

leagueoflegends,2020,1,"I'm a gold 4 support main, I used to be a jungle main but with the new changes jungle just feels shitty to play now so i only play it as an offrole now. Now recently I've been losing a huge amount of ranked games - some were just unlucky, some I made big mistakes, but as a support it's difficult to do much when your team is falling apart from the inside. For instance my last game evelynn and yasuo were just perma flaming each other and nothing would get done.

In the preseason I decided to learn how to play thresh and add him to my champion pool since i honestly believe he is a staple to a support champ pool thanks to utility and versatility, I know a lot of people say that in lower elo you shouldn't play mechanically challenging champions and focusing on learning the game but I honestly think my game knowledge is pretty decent, now I just wanna get super good at one champion and that'll let me climb easier, and I guess thresh will be that champion. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now I notice that my winrates are very low, I have a 39% and 37% winrate respectively on 2 of my most played champions - Thresh and Neeko. (yes I play neeko supp) Those winrates are over 20 ish games

Does that mean I'm just bad? I recently got a yellow demotion shield on my profile and though I blame it on my friend sneaking into my account at 3 am and losing me 8 rankeds in a row (I changed my password now) I think the problem is me. I'm not one of those ""my teams all suck and thats why I dont climb"" guys, I'm a firm believer that there are 2 things that win games more than anything else; vision control and a good, tilt-proof mentality.

This is because of what thy title mentions. Only ever reason that you may have not noticed this before is because Akali's you matched agaisnt didnt abuse it.

I take issue with the fact that if these players are behind it impacts the game so heavily that the remaining 3 players often have a near impossible job to win the game (f.e. perma roaming support that deals a lot of dmg, with jungle that can just do every drake and granting humongus leads).

A lot of people these days use the coach as the scapegoat whenever a popular or good team loses (see: SKT, TSM).

The ONLY good MR items in the game are spirit visage and merc treads.

D) all of the above

I have 2 suggestions:

1) Bring back FON, Force of Nature.

2) Create a new MR item, like sunfire cape (moonfire cape?), with the same unique passive, just granting MR instead of armour.

Right now if the enemy picks 4AD you can stack armour very efficiently. 

If they pick 4AP you can't do the same. It's actually not possible to itemise against mages, especially due to the fact that magic pen items are incredibly cheap and powerful. Along with most other AP items being too cheap for how strong they are - giving too much stats.",1577890116

leagueoflegends,2020,1,"Johnsun is currently **Rank 2** on the NA Challenger Leaderboard sitting at **1407LP**. He mostly plays the meta ADC champions such as Xayah, Kaisa, Tristana and Caitlyn to climb.

His accounts are:
      [|John5un - Rank 2|](https://na.op.gg/summoner/userName=John5un)
      [Johnsun1 - Rank 9|](https://na.op.gg/summoner/userName=Johnsun1)

      [Johnsun 2021 - Rank 17|](https://na.op.gg/summoner/userName=Johnsun+2021)

As an ADC player myself, it's difficult to have control over the early game. With him winning so much and climbing, it must mean there is a certain playstyle to achieve this.
Any thoughts on how he plays and how he will perform in the upcoming LCS season?

leagueoflegends,2020,1,"Correct me if I'm wrong, but, it seems moderately difficult for DH to out-scale Electrocute when only building AD. At nearly every stage of the game, you need quite a few stacks to outpace the raw damage from electrocute. Given the fact that league games seem to end a lot quicker now, and that DH needs 45 seconds without a takedown to grant another stack, is going DH even that viable? To those who have used both runes on AD champions, is Dark Harvest actually good, or is it worse compared to Electrocute?

Here's a couple scenarios to consider, you need:

* 14 stacks at Lvl 9 (with 50 bonus AD) to outpace Electrocute by 2 damage

* 16 stacks at Lvl 9 (100 bonus AD) to outpace Electrocute by 1 damage

* 27 stacks at Lvl 18 (100 bonus AD) to match Electrocute

* 30 stacks at Lvl 18 (200 bonus AD) to match Electrocute

- Crescendum is an AA mechanic that truly deserves its own champion, one with multiple distance-modulating abilities (possibly the old Quinn and Valor kit?) There should be constant decision-making between safety/distance and DPS, but because of his lack of mobility and overtuned damage, the whole mechanic seems wasted on Aphelios.

- Infernum does not feel like a flamethrower. I was very curious to see how a Rumble-style flamethrower would work on an AA champion, but the current set up would feel better if he was lobbing grenades. Besides, this gun is a balance nightmare.

I wish they stuck to 3 guns but with far more pronounced strengths and weaknesses, such that not having one available could be a real hindrance in a situation. For example:

Calibrum: 650 range

Gravitum: 550 range, AS does not scale. Instead, slow strength scales with bonus AS

Severum: 450 range, increased lifesteal to compensate

I feel this would’ve forced each gun into a niche and been more fun to play as and against. Thoughts or other suggestions?",1577908931

The items are a lot more niche than Quicksilver Sash or any Grievous Wounds inflicting item, as Stealth is not as prevalent in the game as Crowd Control and Healing, hence why I think we could increase its stats a bit to compensate.

It would also finally give counterplay to stealth as a mechanic. Oracle Lens is cute and works to a certain extent, and ""countering a champions entire existance with 75 gold"" argument always pops up in discussions about having Pink Wards reveal stealth again, so I think there could be a middle ground where you instead counter it with a 1300 gold investment rather than multiple 75 gold ones, similar to how a Quicksilver Sash is bought to counter Skarners Impale or Malzahars Nethergrasp.

Think of it as a QSS tax, but with a new item that offers better stats to compensate for its niche usage.

leagueoflegends,2020,1,"Conqueror has always been a problematic rune but the latest changes mean it's being abused too hard by too many champions. With the season starting sometime in January we need to get some changes on the PBE soon for testing.

The rune is clearly broken and being abused by too many champions that weren't really a problem before the rework to the rune. My suggestion is to remove the adaptive force and have the healing start from the 1st stack 20% max for melee 10% for ranged. Starting at 1,2,4,6,8,9,11,15,18,20 Melee would still get 2 stacks per auto with ranged getting 1. The higher healing is to address some lost power from the removal of Adaptive force.

Removing the Adaptive force would mean only champions that value the healing such as Aatrox would still take the rune instead of mages like Cassio or Ryze or Assassins like Akali Junglers like Lee Sin Garen who can basically instastack it with his Spin.

Any thoughts on my idea and if you don't like my idea how would you try and fix this problematic rune?",1577912463

leagueoflegends,2020,1,"I have been playing this game since S1, always casually. I enjoy this game a lot but I'm not interested in ranked to put a lot of effort into it. Highest I've been is Gold 1 which isn't amazing.

I think I have over 4k normal games and apparently my normal game MMR is through the roof? Almost every game I play against someone who's at least plat or higher.

[Games like this just aren't fair even if they don't play their main role.](https://imgur.com/a/PeoEzvf)

[Most of these games have a major average team rank difference](https://imgur.com/zgSyAAu)

[I could make an entire album about games like this. It's not just a one time thing.](https://imgur.com/C8w5wYM)

I understand that high ranked players want to play normal games to practice new champions and such. But a master player will fundamentally be better than a silver/gold or even plat players. Which in turn ruins the gaming experience for casual players like me.

Feel free to prove me wrong but wouldn't it just make more sense? U need to be good at the game to get to diamond, so even if I may have more games played than someone who's diamond, that player will be better because he/she put a lot of hard work into getting better at the game.

Of course u could be Silver 4 with a diamond 1 friend u want to casually play normals with, that's totally understandable but there are definitely more than enough player playing this game for MM to at least make somewhat fair teams. (Something like smurfs and such I understand that riot games/MM can't do much about of course)

Why is he not locked out of games with people like me who have a ping under 20 all game, every game?

Now onto the second point of this post, the absolute disgusting-ness of this un-killable Chogath.

He healed for 16.5k damage over the course of a 35 minute game, along with dealing 56.3k damage!

In an interview with RNG's Beijing manager Bi Lianli, she said and I quote "" it wasn't unusual for some players to be paid six-figure sums of yuan annually, in addition to any winnings."" 

Note: Six-figure sums of yuan is about $150,000 USD.  

The way she puts it seems to imply that not all RNG members earn six-figure a year and that six-figure is the max a player could earn cause otherwise she would have said 7 figures or 8 figures instead.  This means UZI's salary is less than $150k!  

Upon learning this I became quite upset to be honest.  It is pretty clear now that NA teams have no idea what they are doing and are grossly overspending on domestic talent! Like instead of paying Wildturtle 700k a year Flyquest could just get the UZI/Ming duo for less than $300k.  And instead of paying Huni $1.15 mil why didn't DIG just get TheShy? I mean as popular and good as he is, he couldn't possibly earn much more than UZI.  So his salary is probably $200-250k USD max.

leagueoflegends,2020,1,"It seems like there was a lot of misunderstandings with my last post so let me clarify some things in this one.  


We all know that Yuumi stays on a champ for as long as she wants and its annoying. What if a knock up/displacement kicked Yuumi off a champ and put her W on a 3-5 second cool down. Now im not saying she is OP or anything like that but the fact that she can hop from one champ to the next with no counter play. Yes she has been nerfed pretty hard but what im suggesting is if this is implemented then obviously she would need some buffs so she is playable. This way there is some kind of form to make sure Yuumi isnt basically on a champion throughout the entire game. Also makes sure that Yuumi players cant just afk on a champion, they have to pay more attention and position properly to make more plays. There is only 54 (55 with Sett) champions with a knock up/displacement in the game, that is about 1/3 of all champs so there are about 2/3 of champions left without one. There can still be some games where Yuumi can be basically on a champ all game if your/enemy team doesnt counter pick her and she will still be strong. Just with any strong champ if you dont pick a counter to them they will thrive, like Master Yi who can just hard carry if your/enemy team doesnt have hard cc for him.

leagueoflegends,2020,1,"If you don't know what Arena is, it is a 5v5 deathmatch in a... Arena. The game has no towers, or inhibitors. Only minions that are designed to reach the enemy base.  Each team starts with 500 points, the goal is to make the other team reach 0 points.

&amp;#x200B;

How this is done, is killing an enemy player is -5, last hitting a minion is -1, if a minion reaches the base it is -1 for each minion, if a ""boss"" minion reaches the base it is -15.

So, I’m pretty new to the game, but when I get into a draft due to the free champions being enough to use, I usually ask others who to ban, and if no one takes a second ban for themselves, I am unsure what to pick.

So, especially considering this is low ELA (this isn’t even ranked, its draft), if I don’t get someone to ban, am I an A-hole for banning a beginner friendly champion like Ahri?  Since new players might gravitate towards that and the only reason I’m banning Ahri is because it’s easy to pick up and Newbies may be using it as a crutch, am I the A-hole?",1577923624

Explanation:  
Team Liquid - I don't actually see Broxah as a huge upgrade for the overall team of TL, but I don't think his impact will necessarily be negative either. The team dynamic might change up a little, and that might be the strongest point for the Broxah acquisition. Other than this, they still remain the team to beat with top players in each position. I think the only  bot lanes with the potential to challenge Doublelift and CoreJJ for the split will be 100T, TSM and DIG, each with their own caveats. Impact will likely remain a solid rock in the top lane unless Broxah's playstyle trends more towards the topside of the map, in which Impact will likely demolish his opponents, and if not Impact, Jensen might find some newfound synergy with his new jungler. This team is neither an upgrade or a downgrade from the previous year in terms of player strength, but the rest all depends on how Broxah affects the team dynamic.

&amp;#x200B;

TSM - Player strength wise, TSM is the only other team with the potential to topple TL at their best. Each of their players that they have acquired has the potential to topple their direct opponent. Dardoch's personality clashes seem to be a thing of the past, with successful stints on Optic and Echo Fox that lasted for each respective year. If Dardoch manages to take over the jungle this split like he did with Echo Fox, and manages to provide Brokenblade and Bjergsen with the firepower they need, this team would have the strongest top side of any team in the region, and from what I can understand about Kobbe and Biofrost, the bot lane will attempt to have a somewhat even lane and be a stable source of lategame proactivity. Dardoch and Biofrost are apparently rather vocal members for shot calling, so I could see this working out rather well. The biggest caveat to this team is that the team dynamics might not work out to be as strong. Despite this, I think at worst, this team achieves a 3-4th place finish due to their pure strengths demonstrated over the consistent high performances of Dardoch's and Bjergsen's careers.

&amp;#x200B;

EG - This team definitely has all the right pieces to surge to the top of the LCS. However, it all relies on everything playing to an optimal level. Every player aside from Kumo, who is an effective rookie, has been tried and tested before, and has extremely high variance. Bang was a solid member for 100T, but rather forgetable. Svensekeren just got the MVP award, but prior to that has always been in and out of the upper echelon. Jiizuke just came away from EU having a rather poor split, but at the same time he was a core piece in the Vitality effect in 2018 worlds. Zeyzal has just come off a forgettable year as well, but that was after having a rather good year in 2018. Kumo is promising, but he also seems to require a fair amount of resources. This teams high variance has me reluctant to put them in the top 2, but at worst thy barely miss playoffs. 

&amp;#x200B;

CLG - In short, this team has upgraded in the mid lane, and downgraded their support role. Smoothie's time on TSM wasn't the best, but he was still a solid support for the most part. Crown looked exceptional on Optic however. This is yet another team with potential. However, what makes me reluctant to place them higher than other teams listed above, is the fact that most of their pieces have been tried and tested. They are consistent with the exception of Wiggily, who seems to be aging quite nicely as a more than capable jungler. Sure, you have Ruin making inconsistent plays all game, randomly dying whilst also sometimes pulling off a clutch play, but in the grand scheme of things, you expect Ruin to play like this. With Stixxay and Smoothie, we know that we can expect them to consistently perform to levels anywhere from 5th to 3rd in the LCS. And that happens to be where I think the team will place when the split comes to an end.

&amp;#x200B;

100T - This team has a little more variance than CLG. Ssumday and Meteos have remained consistent figurepieces of the LCS since they've joined, consistently enjoying the successes of each roster they have participated in. Ssumday has been an MVP calibre top laner through most of his time in the LCS, with last year being a smudge in his otherwise sparkly career. Meteos was just a core piece of the Optic duo that carried them through to playoffs in spite of their lackluster top and bottom lanes. This is the entirety of their team's consistency however. Whilst many people tend to give Cody Sun a lot of credit for the resurgence of Clutch last year, I tend to credit the management of Dignitas with their success a lot more. I don't think Cody Sun will often be the reason this team loses, but he will barely ever win through lane. He plays much more like a Zven or Bang than a Piglet, Doublelift or Stixxay, with the latter three having moments of brilliance in their LCS careers as the pinnacle of lane dominance. I think if Stunt can bandaid this laning deficiency with some intelligent roaming like Olleh in Immortals, this team could be quite the spectacle. However, that leaves one more piece of the puzzle. Ry0ma. This is the most important piece for this team's success quite frankly, and their success is left on the line of how good Ry0ma actually is. If he performs to a top tier calibre, this team could easily compete for first, but likewise, he could be the only mid laner worse than Goldenglue. My suspicion is that he will perform fine, and play a rather stable lane, but I don't think he will reach the levels of some of the top talents. I personally think that this team had no reason to choose Ry0ma over Pobelter, as Pobelter could have been a nice fit on this roster. I don't think this team would ever achieve a last place finish in the LCS, but I don't think Ry0ma will be strong enough to get this team into semis. At worst, I think this team is 8th, at their very best, 3rd.  


Dignitas - To me, this org proved it's worth last split in the revitalization of Clutch Gaming. This gives me faith that this team will overperform my power ranking of them, much like C9 which I will talk about next. The core of Huni, Froggen and Aphromoo have all had their share of triumphs and failures, and whilst lately, Aphromoo and Froggen have seen more failures, I suspect they will be perfectly  fine with Dignitas. Aphromoo's shotcalling and experience for example will be crucial for guiding the mechanically gifted rookie adc, Johnsun. His plays last year on 100T were less than desirable, and he often cam out looking like the bad end of the joke, however, his consistent high level prior to this allows me to forgive one bad year on a roster that never had a decent mid laner. Enter Froggen, a mid laner that seemed to never be able to find a good team. Froggen seems to get a lot of community backlash as being washed up or a poor performing player, and I think that this comes entirely from results driven analysis rather than actually watching him play. As someone who is a fan of Piglet, I entirely feel sympathy for Froggen's plight in recent years as the narrative grows stronger. Nothing is worse than having your reputation buried by bad rosters and bad orgs, and fans who look entirely at team placement instead of including a performance based analysis. Much like how Piglet was the biggest reason Clutch won games during Spring Split 2019, Froggen was the main reason with Hauntzer that GG could make playoffs, and it was their performances alone that allowed this team to have any threat whatsoever. Furthermore, this team has secured Huni, a staple top laner who really improved over the course of Summer last year to outright carry Clutch to worlds. The main caveat in my view is Grig, who has never been a remarkable jungler. Johnsun is a rookie, so I don't rate him particularly highly, however, all he needs to be is serviceable in order to provide value to his team. As long as he can compete with LCS talent and go somewhat even with his counterparts, he will be fine. Grig on the other hand has a harder task where he must be more proactive in trying to get the most out of both Huni and Froggen. I think Grig is more important to this lineup than any other player on any other org. He is not known to be very proactive, which is really what this team needs in their jungle position, and that holds me back from placing them any higher. If he manages to be a strong proactive jungler, this team could threaten for first place, and will make playoffs even if Aphromoo remains a bottom 2 support player. If he plays like prior splits, this team will rely yet again on Froggen as their core, and I don't know that it will be enough. At their worst, this team gets 9th.

&amp;#x200B;

C9 - As I mentioned with Dignitas, the C9 org has proven that they tend to outperform the raw power of their players. However, with the roster posted from dotesports, this team fails to have a strong win condition. Fudge is an entirely unproven talent, and if he is the starting player over Licorice, I don't know where this team will seek to find success outside of one of their miracles. Maybe Zven becomes a lane dominant player and crushes bot lane. Maybe Blaber is the new prodigy and MVP. Maybe Fudge will put a pounding on every other top laner. Either way, these are nothing short of the miracles this team needs to succeed. I think that whilst Nisqy is a great player, he had demonstrated to us in Summer that his performances came from his synergy with Svenskeren and his ability to spread his presence across the map. If it turns out that Fudge is not actually the starting top laner, and Licorice is, then I suspect that this team will be much better, but until then or a weird miracle, I think that 7th is a fair ranking.  


Immortals - This is a team that I see as holding wasted talent. Xsmithie and Hakuho are exceptionally good players that simply deserve to be on better rosters, and whilst SoaZ comes off a bad run with Misfits, he has otherwise had a solid career. Their other two pieces however, they leave me screaming in a weird mixture of frustration and confusion. Eika and Altec? Really? Whilst Ry0ma leaves me wondering about his performances, I have heard a lot of positive things about his OCE performances. Eika doesn't have the same reputation however. It would be far easier, and make so much more sense to take Pobelter, who has worked with Xsmithie in multiple years and found success with Xsmithie in those years. Likewise, the synergy of Apollo and Hakuho has been replaced by Hakuho and Altec? Apollo to me has been the pinnacle of LCS consistency for the adc position. Never bad, never good. And he has played with Hakuho for years, and now they split them up so that they can have an adc that has consistently been the worst player on some otherwise good teams. The last time we saw Altec was with Echo Fox, and whilst Echo Fox performed fine with him, it came from almost completely ignoring that their bot lane existed. With Apollo and Pobelter this team would be a likely playoff contender, but as is, even though I rate the core of Xsmithie, SoaZ and Hakuho quite highly, Immortals has annoyed me with the rest of their roster.

Flyquest - have they made any meaningful upgrades? No, not really. Wadid was not a great acquisition last year, but nothing leads me to believe IgNar will be any better. Wildturtle still isn't a top 5 adc and V1per is a good role player, but not a top tier top laner. PoE is hardly what I'd call an upgrade over Pobelter either. This team will struggle to make playoffs without Santorin dragging them there like he did in Spring last year.But more than likely, Santorin will remain a mediocre jungler, despite his solo queue performances showing a lot of promise. 

Golden Guardians - This team is dragging Hauntzer's name through the mud with this roster. Whilst I like the idea of bringing in OCE talent, the idea of NA mid laners, the idea of role swapping an adc to support, I don't think it works at all with Golden Guardians. First of all, Keith's career has never shown promise outside of his stint on TL. Aside from that one split, he has consistently proven to be a bottom tier adc. He is role swapping to support, but I don't see how that will make him any better. FBI, whilst he showed some promise in some games last split, is not at a level where he can carry games yet. He is far from consistent, and needs some veteran talent to guide him to his potential. He might benefit greatly from having Aphromoo or Biofrost as his support, but with Keith, I don't know how he's supposed to develop from an adc that is strictly worse than him. Goldenglue prior to his time on C9 has been one of the worst mid laners the LCS has seen. TL put a whole year into this guy, yet both times they needed to replace him just to avoid being relegated. He was so far from being an LCS level talent, and this was despite the amount of resources and time put into developing his skill and talent. Their jungler in my opinion is a big question mark. Whilst he was a strong performer in a minor region, at best it suggests his talent levels might equal someone like Brokenblade or Ruin. That isn't bad by any means, but more than likely, he will be about as good as his adc counterpart, if not slightly better. Through all of these players, you have a Hauntzer at the end, that I suspect will be the sole reason this team is capable of winning any games. Outside of a severe misjudgement of this organization's decisions, this team has no chance of making it to playoffs, let alone making it further. I don't know why this team exists or what their purpose is.",1577924860

Here are the standard rules for 1v1 that i know :
- on howling abyss
- however gets the first blood wins
- however gets the first tower wins
- however gets 100 cs wins

To counterbalance the fact that some game will be 1min long I think it should be a BO3 or maybe BO5.
We could chose between a random 1v1 or a draft 1v1 with one ban for each.

# Quick recap on what we know:

Valeeva was one of the Darkin/Sunborn/Ascended of ancient Shurima, and she had a brother:

From *Twilight of the Gods*: 

&gt;""Valeeva, you and your brother saw spite in every eye, and sought vengeance for slights real and imagined.”  
&gt;  
&gt;“Oh, they were real,” she hissed, her alabaster skin threaded with violet veins and her venomous spines standing erect at her shoulders.

Note that this states that she was pale (alabaster skin). Now yes, this is her appearance as a darkin, which I don't believe she is anymore (but we'll come back to that in a moment) and could be very different from her appearance as a human, but I think it's still important. ""Le blanc"" is literally french for ""the white"" and LeBlanc is also known as ""the Pale Woman"" or ""the Pale Sorceress.""

Now this quote is also used to support the idea that Valeeva is Varus' sister because of the reference to vengeance, and the fact that Varus is looking for his sister in the story *Dark Kin*. I'm not sure if Valeeva being Varus' sister has been explicitly confirmed by Riot but we're going to just roll with this.

At the end of *Twilight of the Gods*, we have:

&gt; Ta’anari lifted a hand, seeking the touch of another living being, but no one took it.  
&gt;  
&gt;“Sulpae?” he croaked. “Is that you? Teushpa? Idri-Mi? Please, help me. I think... I think I am mortal once more, I... I think I am human again...”  
&gt;  
&gt;“You are,” said a voice that seemed on the verge of laughter.  
&gt;  
&gt;“Myisha,” whispered Ta’anari. “Are they all dead?”  
&gt;  
&gt;“No. Naganeka, Valeeva and Cebotaru escaped before the fire could take them. But they’re pretty weak, so I don’t think they’ll be a problem for long. It’s the others, all those who didn’t show up, who’ll be harder to trap.”  
&gt;  
&gt;“No! You must finish them,” wheezed Ta’anari. “Even a wounded god-warrior could conquer this world.”

So Valeeva escaped, and Myisha (Aspect of Twilight before Zoe) says she's pretty weak. And since Myisha also confirms that Ta'anari has become human again after the moonblast that reversed the Ascension, I'm going to take this to mean that Naganeka,  Valeeva, and Cebotaru are also human now. This is why Valeeva probably wouldn't have her violet veins and venomous spines anymore, but could still have her pale skin. Ta'anari also warns Myisha that ""even a wounded god-warrior could conquer this world."" And we know how ambitious LeBlanc is in that regard, forming the Black Rose with Vladimir and orchestrating all kinds of plots and schemes from the shadows with her magic. She is also possibly the ""Faceless One"" of the Noxian Trifarix, a powerful position indeed, and Noxus itself is seeking to conquer the known world.

# Extra info and speculation (skip unless interested):

It's also worth noting the first person she goes to is Vladimir, a human who uses forbidden blood magic taught to him by his former darkin master to fuel his immortality. If LeBlanc is Valeeva, it's perfectly plausible that she already knew his darkin master and possibly Vladimir himself from when she too was a darkin, and she could have retained similar darkin knowledge of magic to extend her life after she became human again. If I have my timeline right, she also doesn't go to Vladimir until the time of Mordekaiser's reign about 150-450 years after the Great Darkin War finally ends with the sealing of Varus in Ionia by the ""flaming-haired golden warrior queen"" (likely a past Aspect of the Sun) who ordered her mages to bury her alive with the darkin bow. Zoe is born within a 75 year window after LeBlanc takes down Mordekaiser, so Myisha, and probably the one of the previous Aspects of War too, probably died some time before that, possibly as the Great Darkin War was still raging. With the Aspects gone, there is no one left to hunt her or who could recognize who she once was, so she's free to come out of hiding.

Varus might not know that Valeeva is human now, especially if both of them were more concerned with fighting/hiding from the Aspects at the time, so it still makes sense for him to be looking for his sister in Shurima, in tombs and ruins that might be good places to hide a darkin weapon that he probably thinks she was sealed in. LeBlanc probably knows that Varus is looking for Valeeva but may be keeping her distance if she's unsure how he would react to the fact that she's human, especially since he seems to like killing humans.

# Moving on to visual clues:

Let's look at LeBlanc's classic splash art:

https://preview.redd.it/ik74850nv9841.jpg?width=1215&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4fb3927bf042e8f48b6188440600d7412d054d85

and Varus' classic splash art:

https://preview.redd.it/ax7pkutov9841.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=01b6cce95aaa4ea152f75795d43d4692a15f34ad

Notice anything? Besides the fact that all the gold stuff LeBlanc has (headpiece, bracers, and staff) gives off way more of a Shuriman vibe than a Noxian one, I mean. That's right, they both have a red diamond shaped gem on their forehead. Varus has another one around his neck too, but I don't have a reason for this. Then again so does Anivia, so maybe it's nothing. The pink/purple colour on Varus' heart... thing, and LeBlanc's staff might be sort of related to each other too. Similar darkin magic, perhaps? ~~Maybe LeBlanc still has those ""venemous spines"" on her shoulders, or scars from where they were - we can't really see them. And her uh... outfit is slightly reminiscent of ""violet veins""~~ but I'm definitely reaching here.

But seriously, compare LeBlanc's accessories to Azir's, Sivir's Nasus', and any of the Guardian of the Sands skins. They have a similar style complete with gems too, but those gems are all **blue** and LeBlanc's and Varus' are both **red**. Know what else is red? **DARKIN.** Big coincidence? I don't think so! ^(Just ignore Anivia please.)

# TL;DR:

Lore-wise, there are a number of reasons why it's at least plausible that LeBlanc could be Valeeva, Varus' sister, and there is an interesting similarity in their splash art, along with the fact that LeBlanc seems visually more Shuriman than Noxian, imo.

 Not everyone can get along, and obviously we cant kill all of the community's anger. But if you can keep another player sane for at least one more match, it's one more shot at an enjoyable one after, and I think it's totally worth it to try.

leagueoflegends,2020,1,"The other day I played a whole lot of league and when I went to sleep I dreamed about me playing league. You see in this dream things were not exactly as they truly are.

And there was one massive change. I was playing Darius, not sure how or what was going on but the thing is, that I bought an item that seemed to be a Trinity force, but in reality it was different, it had the hexdrinker on it, instead of the Stinger and added 10% spell vamp. Also then I popped off or something cool happened, but that's not the case.

This was just a weird concept, the thing, is it that bad of an idea to make another Triforce or a brand new item with hexdrinker on it? Because hexdrinker feels like a really powerful item in the early game, but then it just becomes so worthless that I can't even express it. In fact Maw is an item that I would never build over steraks on most champions, or if you are playing a ranged champion you would prefer Mercurial scimitar. Or maybe some adjustment to the item? I'm starting to thinkg that due to this underperformance is why these champions like Akali, Elise or Syndra seem to be more powerful and opressive than they actually are. Since games usually end at 2-3 items it's not affordable to spend 1.3K gold on an item that's not worth upgrading.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not a fan of making the same item path twice for 2 different items but I feel like it could be cool idea, maybe bring it up on some other item or a redesign. It doesn't have to be trifoce. And Hexndrinker had always been one of those items that only builds into one item just like seeker's armguard or Haunting guise (the Liandry's one), but things can always change, just like with Stinger!",1577938460

leagueoflegends,2020,1,"I am a depressed and anxious young man. I have panic attacks in which I feel I am dying; have constant paranoid thoughts that various body functions will stop working at any moment, specially at brain and heart; and have physiological effects from stress, ranging from shaking, to headaches, to being short on breath and so on. League of Legends is being an important part of my treatment, along with physical activies, healthy food habits, meds and therapy. :)

Whenever I feel like I'm in the verge of having a stroke, I start playing League as adc and tryhard as much as I can. It makes me feel safe, in the sense that if I'm able to read chat, ping my team mates, farm, position well in team fights and whatever, then I'm certainly not facing cardiovascular problems. If I'm shaking too much due anxiety, I queue as support, so I can focus on something without having to click too much. It helps A TON during the stressfull minutes that I have to wait until the medications start making effect on my body.

Playing League of Legends is also working as a great barometer for my stress-related issues. Playing normal games or aram aid me in relaxing and slowing down my tempo (on top of my ilnesses, I'm a workaholic). And playing ranked games help me check how my stress level really is: if I can in general enjoy the game, then I know I am handling my stress level well. If my eye start twitching or I feel not so well in any manner, I know I have to take some time to rest.

Watching e-sports, specially Brazilian championship, became a greatly needed hobby - as I said, it's hard to me to stop and feel chill and ease. CBLOL has been a thing on what I can ""lose"" 8 hours on the weekend just doing nothing but existing and watching the games. That helps me resetting my mindset, and gives my brain some needed rest as well.

So, yeah, I started playing long after what some people consider League's prime, but my experiences with the game so far are being great so I felt like sharing it. :) Other games probably could have the same impact, but for me League have a set of characteristics very specific for what I need and enjoy in this moment of my life, and I am very excited to see what it have to offer in 2020. Sorry about any minor grammar errors, as my english is just meh, and have a good day. ♥

Like what is the weakness? How has this allowed to be so overpowered for so long? If you compare this to hexdrinker (ad equivalent vs ap champs) is just a bad joke (more expensive, not even 100% gold efficient, cooldown on part of its stats).

They reduce Vinelashers slow from 30% to 25% and make it stackable up to 50% when 2 Vinelashers are attacking the same target.

But, when you hit the snare your enemy cant move for 1 - 2 seconds based on skillpoints on E. 
A plant attacks every 1.25 seconds and applies a 2sec slow. The value a good Zyra gets from this is minor, because by the time the plant gets a 2nd rotation one plant is already killed.
If you did not lock autotargetting, you automatically attack the nearest enemy upon being snared, in this case the plant. Melee champs onehit them with one auto without playercommand. Having attackspeedboots and few level denies a 2nd 50% slowrotation as well. So what you end up getting is 5% less slow than on live as result.
Later both plants just die in snare leaving you without bonusdamage and without a slow.
Tiamat removes both plants instantly attacking one and using its active. In a simple EWWR combo both plants already die before they get empowered by ult.
Even if both plants make it to the empowered state, attacking one plant and using the tiamat kills one plant and leaves the other one at 1/3 HP in an eyeblink.

Most of the time you will just get a 25% slow and overall less damage because you arent placing a thornspitter with higher range.

I dont get what the point of the buff is anyway. There are alot of other interactions that make plants just suck as well like:
Bramblevest/Thornmail oneshots plants.
A melee autoattack.
Irelia Q/Yasuo E give them free dashes/resets, while oneshotting the plants the same time.
Ryze E, Cass E with refunds for example.
Or a single GP ultwave instantly kills an ulted plant.
Cinderhulk. Singed Q damagerefreshrate everything is so annoying.
Alot of abilities just deal way more damage than they should just because they are coded to deal AoE damage, while being multihit, dealing 4x the damage they should. Every ability at least halflifes a plant. Most mages buy ludens as well so even the dot abilities oneshot plants.

All this just for the sake that she has a ton of plants. In my opinion having less plants and giving her plants with more quality would just improve the champ overall. And the change they are doing now would make sense if needed. The plant HP just doesnt make sense since more than 2 years now.",1577942319

At your friends tab create a friends folder (you just have to do this once and don't delete it).
Now you just simply drag and drop one of your friends into it. Now it should be updated.

Every time you want to refresh just drag someone into an other folder than they're currently in.",1577950350

leagueoflegends,2020,1,"Hey, folks. I play support, and recently I've been putting a lot of emphasis on dragons in S10. I set up vision for it, contest scuttle crabs, and if possible keep lane priority. I ping the dragon timer, usually at 90 seconds, 60 seconds, and 30 seconds. If I see the enemy jungler moving for it I let the team know.

But recently junglers have just been avoiding drakes like the plague! Like while the enemy jungler is solo'ing it, they're off farming some nothing camp. Even two or three drakes in they just don't seem to think they have any importance to the game at all. But apparently me asking to play around drakes makes me a toxic whiner.

So from a jungler's perspective, is there a good reason for junglers to be actively avoiding drake fights, all other things being equal?",1577950723

His whole shtick is to be a lane bully and try to snowball the mid game before settling into a front liner that can potentially kill the adcs.  But every time i take him top lane I just find that he is not able of generating that lead. Riven can flat out burst him down and dodge all of his Q's which take a while to hit, Garen out sustains him considering you have a heal that comes up once in a while and will heal you for at max 40 in laning phase, Fiora is fiora, Darius can easily 1 v 1 him, Nassus will just build armor and farm like its nobodies business, poppy can negate his escapes and stop herself from getting hit by his Q, Mord will also just straight up out fight him to since he can proc conqueror so much faster.

leagueoflegends,2020,1,"I‘ve played the game since preseason 8 now and I own close to 100 skins.
These skins probably divide in 30% Skins i wanted because I play the champ a lot (Star Guardian Syndra, Both ASol Skins), 30% Skins i got from chests / rerolls 10% skins I got simply because I think they are awesome (ig Kai‘sa) and then 30% I got simply because I play the champ and they were cheap when I had some RP left (some TF skins). 

What I noticed is, since i play... I never witnessed riot releasing skins cheaper than 1350 RP. 
While Skins get better and better and quality has it’s price. Why don‘t they at least release some 750RP or so skins again.

I get that they straight up get more money out of them and that new skins are usually very high quality. 

But what has changed. 

There are so many (old) but good skins that are 750 or so and in my opinion riot even wastes a chance of getting money through spontaneous skin purchases. What am I supposed to do when I only have 1000 RP. I don‘t want to buy chests. Why don‘t we just get some cheaper skins again. 
I can deal with my skin not having a new recall as long as there’s a new model.

How about ultimate hunter paired with cloud drakes and/or cdr. If I have 4 cloud drakes paired with a fully stacked cloud drake give 65% ult cdr. How about if you have 40cdr.

leagueoflegends,2020,1,"I'm not sure if it is very prevalent in higher ELOs, but in low bronze - mid silver I've noticed nearly every other game has at-least one person who feeds heavily. I don't always think it's due to trolling or ""inting"", in fact, usually it's not. I think the problem is that most people go into ranked matches before they're ready. This could stem from overconfidence or just underestimating the difficulty of the players they will face in ranked. This dilemma can cause one to be conflicted in the post-match lobby over whether you should report someone for inting or not. I think a good solution to this would be to offer an ""Extremely Poor Play"" report option. Given enough reports the player would be banned from ranked matches for a certain amount of time. I also want to note that this option would only be available in ranked matches as a method of ""forcing"" someone to practice more in normals (If they want to play during their ban period). I also want to note that this type of report couldn't get someone's entire account banned no matter how many they received (the ranked ban period would just get progressively longer). This would help clean up the quality of ranked matches while forcing low-skill players to improve in normals. I consider it a win-win.",1577959281

The reason is that these champions generally sacrifice something lategame for their early game opressiveness. They dont scale all that well unless they get fed. The problem is the likes of cassiopia, ryze and vayne going top, getting a free early game, abusing you off farm AND outscaling you. 

Im not the one to say i have the solution. its a complex issue caused by range being such an innate advantage but it realy screws with the intended power curves of these champions when they get a free early game by going top so they can scale into a hypercarry with the toplaner having no interaction to do anything about this.

If your not going to let me have fun early game, and i play well enough to survive and farm up, i should have the oppertunity to stop you having fun late game.",1577970404

I bought the event pass one day after release, knowing I would be playing a lot over the holidays and new year. I completed the last milestone before christmas and ever since... well.. nothing.

I am hoping that you guys will come watch me make the transition, help in the learning process and support my move. Links to VODs worth watching, streamers, guides, tuturials, tips or newbie content would be greatly appreciated.

There is no item in the game that counters any of those, along with her taking conqueror and getting the free tenacity in the tree, she gets a total of 51% tenacity, so even the CC does not counter the champion.  


Master yi with duskblade ruins the very notion that you can CC master yi when he isn't in his Q and blow him up, with duskblade there are no downframe to cc him so there is no possibility to play against the champion.  


Imperial mandate Ashe with manamune makes a 3 seconds CD spell that is utterly unavoidable by movement or dashing dealing 400 total damage because the item is meant for supports, and one lone ADC can abuse it.

Won't the shield/bubble (in theory) collide with the enemy champion that she is dashing to? What or how it would feel like being hit by the shield from the perspective of the champion that is fighting Quinn in this scenario?

leagueoflegends,2021,1,"# TL;DR

TL;DR, Lets give the highest burst role in the game more percentage armor pen, sustain and a shield while being almost statistically better than assassin items from before the rework. This also includes all items in the game being generally stronger in some way compared to previous items without changing a large portion of the champions balance in order to keep it fun and interesting.

# The Role of an Assassin

It is no secret that assassins are early game power houses by default. It is often hard to keep up with a mid lane assassins damage as any other role in the game, simply because they are designed to be strong early, and fall off later into the game. This was consistent throughout the previous seasons of league and was the status quo of assassins in season 10, so that will be the reference point. Thus, the role of an assassin is usually to get an early lead, and then snowball the game for themselves or their other laners in order to make the game very difficult to come back from. This is the basic idea of an assassin and their role on the rift.

By nature, Assassins are feast or famine. They either succeed in their ability to out skill the opponent, or fail and are little use to their team. With all of this in mind, here is why Eclipse is one of if not the worst designed items in league of legends history.

# The Problems with Eclipse

There are a lot of tools that Eclipse gives an assassin. There is a passive damage boost which always gets activated during a burst combo, dealing effectively 60-200 damage to squishy targets depending on HP and grants a small shield to the assassin. This item also gives Percent Armor Penetration (up to 20%) on its Mythic passive, as well as flat lethality. Continually, there is 10% omnivamp on the item for sustain, with 55 Attack damage. For reference, the lethality and attack damage values are identical to pre-rework Youmuu's Ghostblade, which was a common first item for assassins at a comparable cost. As well as the item passive damage being similar to that of pre-rework Duskblade, another commonly built starting item for assassins pre-rework.

There are 3 problems with this item. The first one is the 10% omnivamp. Assassins are designed to kill, how ever melee assassins often lose trades to ranged matchups and are required to all in. With 10% omnivamp along side Ravenous Hunter, healing is almost never an issue. Because Vamp Scepter builds into Eclipse, getting early lifesteal is really easy, and provides more value than even pre-lethality Blade of the Ruined King did for Zed back in Season 3-6. This allows assassins to keep up in losing lanes, and after picking up eclipse, essentially always go into a fight at full HP, and never requiring to play passive if they take a bad trade. This now removes some of the high skill cap that is required to play assassins, because messing up has less penalty than before.

The second problem with Eclipse is the Percent armor penetration on the mythic passive. Percent armor penetration is often times the best stat against any character that builds armor items. Why this stat becomes an issue on an assassin item is because that then gives 2 different stats to deal with armor. Flat armor negation with lethality, and then percent armor negation. Because of this, building armor items is almost worthless, because stacked with full lethality items plus selling boots, assassins and anyone who builds Eclipse plus Serylda's Grudge will have a cap of 50% armor penetration PLUS lethality. What is armor anyways right? For reference, I have seen a Zed 1 shot a full tank J4 through Gargoyles and 300 armor. This isn't to say that this did not exist in season 10. Lethality items plus a flat penetration item were often built on assassins in season 10 with Duskblade, Youmuu's, Edge of night and then Lord Dominik's Regards being the most common. How ever, Lord Dominiks only gave 35% where Serylda's and Eclipse can give upwards of 50%. This makes a big deal later on in the game as more armor gets shredded.

The last problem I have with the item is the idea behind the item. Assassins are meant to be countered by tanks. Tanks are designed to be unburst-able to some extent, why are we suddenly seeing AD assassins killing tanks? Because Eclipse enables this to happen. The item provides too much value at all stages of the game which allows assassins to never fall off and dominate the game even until 50+ minutes. The item was so broken that in high elo solo queue, Shen was building this item to synergize with his Q passive.

# A Broader look

So what would I do in order to nerf the item? Because the item itself is flawed, I actually don't think the item should exist at all with the current stat line of the item. It covers too many roles, does too many jobs, and ultimately should be reworked into something that is less powerful.

By extension, All items in the game somehow became stronger, or perceptibly stronger, with little to no changes to champions besides the biggest problem champions in the game. The idea of an item swap-up is not a bad one inherently, the problem comes when there was not enough changing or testing during the pre-season to bring champions back in line with the new items. If items as a whole are strong, then items need to be nerfed, or the entire cast of champions who use the items need to be nerfed. If we are to assume the game before pre-season was in a mostly balanced state, which is debatable but will be used as a baseline, then almost all roles got a general increase in power, without much tuning to the roles themselves. In turn the game may still be balanced by numbers, but by player feel, the game is off by a large margin and needs significant balancing time in order to get the game back in line.

The holiday season is almost over, the season is just over a week out. Riot just threw out 10 years of item balance. The ball is in your court Riot, lets see how quickly you can get the game back in line.",1609467141

leagueoflegends,2021,1,"The speed boost areas of the cloud drake level give 35% speed multiplier.  So a faster champion will out run a slower champion in this area.  I don't even buy boots anymore because boots don't give mythic bonuses that a proper t3 item gets so I'm often slower than other opponents.  I think twice before going into cloud speed zone areas if someone is chasing me with a good speed, because their advantage gets amplified.

All that is fun and good, but here is where the math gets wonky: There are various times where a lower speed individual doesn't get run down as fast as pure 35% would suggest.  An example would be if the faster guy is entering a diminishing return step of the speed number(Go too fast and each point makes you go faster only a little more).   So that is the major factor. Another factor is, ""How much difference is there between you and your opponent's speed.  Greater amounts cannot be mitigated easily.""  I don't actually want to do the math, but I can see some really interesting functions are there.  Feel free to crack the code yourself and do the math.",1609467883

With all the new champions added to the game, league was slowly introducing more and more power creep to this game. The new power levels become the standard after their release and something more op has to be released in the next update. Pokemon is an extreme example of power creep, where whenever newer Pokemons were released most of the old pokemons became weaker.

At first, when Riot decided to introduce item changes, I thought it would another big power creep introduced to the game. After reading all the items and theorycrafting different builds, I think these items are way more healthier and will improve LOL's meta. Here are few points for my reasoning.

1. With the introduction to more grievous wound and less overall sustain items, those sustain builds are removed. At the same time, newer bruiser items feel way better and modern to use compared to just having death's dance healing for every single bruiser build.
2. Jungle enchantment removal gives jungler access to their core items sooner making jungle itemization more diverse and healthy.
3. The mythic items with strong effects like invisibility and dashes are balanced by having premium pricing. This means none of them should overtake meta like deaths dance.

Lastly, many players are always building mythic items first. Because of mythic passive, making them as 2nd, 3rd or even 4th item can be better. You never build rabadon or infinity edge first item, since you do not get its full value immediately. There are lot of good legendary items for every stage of the game and players should not ignore them over mythic items.

Here is 1 legendary item combo. On bruiser, going steraks + gargoyle + titanic, then you could go stridebreaker so that you can sell boots late game and free up an item slot. Mindlessly rushing Mythic items are not good, unless it is moonstone on supports.

I think in the future, lot more interesting build will pop up. This item set looks promising.",1609470766

leagueoflegends,2021,1,"Before anyone makes a comment like ""rose-tinted glasses!"" or the like, I played around 200ish games of TT before it was shut down, with some of those games happening around a month before it was closed. 
I'm very aware of the problems that map had; the objectives were strange, the jungle was... a thing that existed, and Vilemaw was a laughably OP buff. Yet I loved a lot of the other things that the map had - Shadow Isles theming, a more fast-paced game with only two lanes, and the unique items, to name a few. It was a fun gamemode that was basically abandoned by Riot, and while I don't expect it to ever come back, it doesn't meant I can't sit back and enjoy the absolutely stupid fun I had on that map.

leagueoflegends,2021,1,"Seraphine: Supportive/Offensive artillery mage champion that scales into late game, but doesn't need gold to be good in the late game. She can flex support, has clear counter-play with her floaty abilities, and has clearly visible team contributions. She has obvious skill expression and variability in her skill shots and she can cc people pre-6 so she can properly peel others. The mythic that she builds, from Moonstone to Liandry's to Luden's to Mandate, as well as the legendaries that support that choice, are based on what her aims are in each game.

Sona: Supportive/Offensive enchanter champion that scales into late game by consuming exorbitant amounts of gold. She once flexed solo lanes, but that got her and Spellthief's Edge nerfed, so now she doesn't. No cc pre-6, so if someone hard engages you, you die or burn sums with almost 0 say on the matter. Her entire kit is automatically aimed, so the counter-play to her is ""kill her"", akin to most hyper carries like Kayle, Trist, Kai'Sa, and so on...but you're the support. Team contributions are hard to notice and skill expression is shallow, so appreciation for her is low. Since she has no skill shots, she's literally forced to face check to ward. Optimal build for her is extremely static.

Riot said they're making another VGU poll in 2021. I'm seriously hoping that Sona's at least a candidate for it. I personally love playing Seraphine, but I also love Sona...but she's pretty fucking crap, I gotta keep it a buck and some change. Sona's kit *literally makes no sense for the role she plays on the team. Her peel sucks, she's high economy, and she's heavily exploitable when she's supposed to either prevent early game exploitation like Janna and Lulu or indulge in exploiting others like Leona or Nautilus.*",1609473252

leagueoflegends,2021,1,"I took what i see aatrox players normally build around lvl 11 and 18 for the test to see how much they get from goredrinker healing 

===================================================================================

At lvl 11(has 1850hp): all conq stacks, having goredrinker,ravenous hydra and a pickaxe while using ult he had 370 ad and lets say for safety aatrox hits hydra at 30% or 555hp so he gets bonus 14% ad so now he has 421 ad and activates goredrinker so if he hits 5 targets he deals 110% ad so that will deal 463 attack  damage and lets say the enemy team block % is (30%, 30%, 50%,50%,40%) so all in all aatrox will deal(324,324,231,231,255) and his e would heal 25% of this damage and 18% omnivamp from ravenous and hunter would also heal for this damage.Healing from e (81hp,81hp,57hp,57hp,63hp).Healing from ravenous (58hp,58hp,41hp,41hp,45hp). In case I miss understood healing i am going to combine these numbers so it will be (139hp,139hp,98hp,98hp,108hp). now if we increase by aatrox ult this healing will be increased by 75% so it's(243hp,243hp,171hp,171hp,189hp) (you could also see the amount of healing from conq but to lazy for that).

&amp;#x200B;

now for the goredrinker part of goredrinker so at 555hp he is missing 1255hp and 12% of that is 150hp and 20% of ad is 92 so that together is 242hp healed per champion hit but this is also increased 75% by the ult so it will be 423hp .so 423\*5 is 2117hp

But let's say by any chance that the most likely happened and the enemy has ignite that will reduce healing by 60 so now healing is. 2117 is 846 and (243,243,171,171,189) is (97,97,68,68,75) and this amount of hp is you know when you are surrounded by 5 people not really op considering i went really into Aatrox's favor except the grevious wounds part  all this every 15 seconds but unlike gargoyle stoneplate it cannot be activated while stunned and is not reduced by an summoner or 800g item.

(40% grevious)(2117 is 1270 and (243,243,171,171,189) is (145,145,102,102,113) again really not that great)

==============================================================================

I will add a !!! when i add the % from spirit visage

At lvl 18(has 3260hp):all conq,goredrinker,ravenous,deaths dance,black cleaver,spirit visage,ninja tabi while using ult he had 549 ad and lets say for safety aatrox hits hydra at 20% or 652hp so he gets bonus 15% ad so now he has 631 ad and activates goredrinker so if he hits 5 targets he deals 110% ad so that will deal 694 attack damage and lets say the enemy team block % is (40%, 50%, 50%,50%,60%) so all in all aatrox will deal(416,347,347,347,277)and his e would heal 30% of this damage and 18% omnivamp from ravenous and hunter would also heal for this damage.Healing from e (124hp,104hp,104hp,104hp,83hp).Healing from ravenous (74hp,62hp,62hp,62hp,49hp). Again in case I miss understood healing i am going to combine these numbers so it will be (198hp,164hp,164hp,164hp,132hp). now if we increase by aatrox ult this healing will be increased by 100% so it's !!!(495hp,410hp,410hp,410hp,330hp) {Now conq also heals for 9% of dealt dmg so it would be for Aatrox with this build(dmg\*(9/100)\*2\*(25/100)) }.

&amp;#x200B;

now for the goredrinker active so at 652hp he is missing 2608hp and 12% of that is 312hp and 20%(631ad)  is 126ad so that together is 478hp healed per champion hit but this is also increased 100% by R and 25% spirit visage so it will  !!! 1195\*5 which comes around to 5975hp healed and now the finale where we amplify 60% grevious wounds so 5975hp comes around to 2390hp and (495hp,410hp,410hp,410hp,330hp) is (198,164,164,164,99)hp every 7 seconds 

&amp;#x200B;

(Sidenote went into practice tool to damage test if it's possible really to kill something like 110armor 110mr 3,6hp monster more defensive stats than this aatrox has) in 5seconds  did it wit Lux as the standard mage and so did Sivir as the the most basic marksmen(no slow, no cc,)

&amp;#x200B;

(BUT here's another little side note. Aatrox is the champion who can double his healing on any other champion with these numbers it would be healing just 2985 and this is best case scenario of hitting 5 people if it hit 3 it would be 1791(just 716 late game with 60%grevious) every 7 seconds but let's say now you do have 2500 hp that can still be taken down in 2-5 seconds that's why on warwick for example gargoyle would be so much better for enabling his drain tank)

&amp;#x200B;

This is just to show how strong goredrinker really is and on Aatrox who just may get the most healing out of this item. it's just mediocre in every stage where there are cons and pros never really being weak or overpowered maybe early lvl 6-8 mythic it is op because the heal is enough to full hp while the enemy laner may not have 40% grevious wounds(even though there's ignite that you get a lot of value against champs that go goredrinker) and the 15 second cdr doesn't really matter because you will need it only once during the towerdive",1609483076

I mean, It's just that his skins are mostly around nature and not much else to it with the exception of Mewokai, Worldbreaker and kind of Victorious.

Sure I guess you can keep the nature theme, but I kind of want a skin for Maokai that turns it into something OTHER than nature to spice things a bit up (Or at least have the Nature theme not be it's main theme, despite still being there in the skin in terms of their visual design) which is what the choices of the skinlines are gonna be based on.

leagueoflegends,2021,1,Champions In the Real World (Garen) #Shorts,1609489015
leagueoflegends,2021,1,"I would like to note that this list isn't some sorta RITO PLS GIVE MOAR SKINS post, but I do think it gives some insight as to how well some of the oldest champions in the game have been given attention to by riot, specifically in the cosmetics department. A champ not necessarily having a legendary skin doesn't mean the champ is neglected or unpopular, but I've always seen the idea of a champ having one is ""I'm established within the League Community enough that Riot has decided to give me something truly special and super high-quality"". I've always entertained the thought that Riot would eventually want to be able to give each of the original 40 a legendary skin, I can't exactly explain why I think this, but I do. 
 
Of the original 40 champions of league, 18 of them do NOT have any skins officially labelled as ""Legendary"" tier according to the wiki, and they are:
 
- Gangplank
- Malphite
- Singed
- Amumu
- Evelynn 
- Fiddlesticks
- Rammus
- Shaco
- Warwick
- Karthus
- Kassadin
- Ryze
- Sivir
- Twitch
- Alistar
- Blitzcrank
- Taric
- Zilean
 
Now I was originally really surprised to see this many champs with no legendary skins but then I realized it's sorta misleading, especially with things like promotional skins that you can't get anymore (Grey Warwick, Medieval Twitch, UFO Corki, etc), skins that are exclusive to Hextech Crafting, and Prestige skins, so I decided to go through the list again and this time remove any champion from the list who falls under those categories. Note: any super rare skin that still has an RP price doesn't count for the purposes of this post

The list of champions without a legendary skin, promotional skin, hextech skin, or prestige skin are:

- Gangplank
- Fiddlesticks
- Shaco
- Karthus
- Blitzcrank
- Taric
- Zilean

One thing I've noticed is that the champions on this list either happen to have multiple skins at 1350 (which could offset the lack of an 1820) or they have almost none at all. Here's a few personal notes I have on each of the champions listed:

- Gangplank has a total of 10 skins, 3 at 1350. He's definitely not lacking in skins, I'm just surprised he hasn't had a legendary yet though. Though, tbh what WOULD a legendary GP skin be? Someone go get Tobias Fate lmao
 
- Fiddle has a total of 9 skins, 2 are 1350, and I'm not actually too surprised he doesn't have a legendary yet as he DID get reworked this year so all his skins at least feel new despite most of them being before 2012 with the exceptions being Risen (2015) and Praetorian (2018)
 
- Shaco also has 9 skins, with 2 being 1350. I honestly don't know much about Shaco to form an opinion on him, but one thing I noticed is that Riot does still know he exists; his skin releases are *sorta* consistent, there is a gap between Wild Card (2015) and Dark Star (2019)
 
- Karthus has 7 skins, 1 is 1350. Ok, here's my deal with Karthus in particular as he's my OTP main and has been since Season 3 almost; My issue is that despite being reworked in 2014, he's had a grand total of 3 skins released afterward, 1 of them being an E-sports skin, the other being released 4 years after his rework (Lightsbane), and his latest one being 4 years after THAT (Infernal). On top of that, not only is Infernal the only skin that's 1350, but the fact that it took 11 or so YEARS before Karthus got his FIRST 1350 skin is just really frustrating. I'm not bashing the skin btw, it looks fantastic and I LOVE the impact sound on his ult with it, but I'm just frustrated it took THIS LONG for some really good Karthus stuff is all. I feel like if anyone on this particular list deserves a legendary skin, it's gotta be Karthus. 
 
- Blitzcrank has 11 skins, 6 are 1350. Blitz happens to have the MOST 1350-tier skins, and yes I'm counting both Lancer variants as separate skins. He's almost the same as GP in that he does have a lot of skins and he DEFINITELY has enough 1350-tier skins to maybe justify not giving him a legendary. That being said, what would a legendary Blitz skin be like? 
 
- Taric has 5 skins, 2 are 1350. I don't think Taric was popular at all outside of his memes, would probably explain why he only had 3 skins before his rework. Taric was reworked in 2016, and then given his first 1350 skin a couple months afterward, which I think is great for a champion to get shortly after getting reworked. Perhaps what isn't quite so great is that he had to wait 4 years before Luminshield got released. I think he could probably use a legendary skin soon, to not get one would be... *Truly Outrageous.*

- Zilean has 6 skins, 1 is 1350. Zilean is just about in the same boat as Karthus here, he's got one less skin, and it took 10 years since his release before he got his first 1350. Why did it take so long for these champs to get a 1350-tier skin? 

idk, this is all just something I felt like putting together, partially as something to think about regarding the first 40 champions of League of Legends, Mostly because I wanted to rant about Karthus and how I feel like sometimes he was just sorta neglected prior to his Infernal skin and I just want a legendary for him already XD",1609489246

leagueoflegends,2021,1,"Hey, I returned to League after a year of absence and immediately had to run into the abomination that is the item shop. I'm not sure how ""new"" it actually is and how much time people had to get used to it, discuss it and Riot to maybe react to feedbacks.

I'm just wondering what's the general opinion on the item shop, is there anything about it that people are widespread against and whether Riot has addressed anything about those things, if such things exist.

Personally I can't fathom how terrible it is to navigate. I'm not saying it after the first time, I've actually been back for about 2 weeks now, played a good couple of games, I learned to use it, but it's still bad. I gave it time, but turns out it's not about being new and unfamiliar, but it's actually trash.

1. No matter what you do, the dumbass ""suggested"" page opens up by default and you can't change this. Not even dedicated item sets will change this.

2. The ""all items"" is not actually all items, because it automatically selects a group of items that it thinks you might want to buy. Of course this also can't be changed.

3. How innovative that instead of a simple drag-and-drop format to resize the shop window, you now have to go to the menu, change the value, exit the menu, open the shop, realize that it's not right and the cycle repeats. Sure you only need to set it once, but still...

4. Talking about sizing, it was truly a wonderful idea to make the proportions of the different segments of the shop completely ridiculous and nonsense, while at the same time removing the feature of customizing the proportions. Why wouldn't you want 75% of the screen to be occupied by like 2 or 3 suggested items, while item descriptions are crammed into a tiny space, which on top of everything is a narrow vertical rectangle shape, so even a short, 1-2 sentence description takes like 10 rows of text, which of course doesn't fit, so you have to scroll. Fascinating stuff.

5. And just to insult you even more, they added the super helpful side-panels for basic items which opens when you hover over, but fear not, because there's a glimpse of hope for customization: you can pin the panels to stay open - until the next game of course when it forgets your preference and removes the pin.

What the fuck is going on? Who approved this? Or is it just me not seeing the brilliance of it?",1609491042

leagueoflegends,2021,1,"Let's say, for the sake of argument, that my bot laner sees Jhin/Xerath bot-lane in Smurf-Queue, and in response picks Illaoi ADC, dies a bunch of times and then runs around the map randomly, seemingly just trying to screw up mid and top lane, and admits, repeatedly, that he doesn't care about winning the game, why is that not punishable? Why does he get to vote no on surrenders and hold games hostage when he's the reason we lost the game in champion select? I don't understand why that's okay, just because on Illaoi he can smash his face on his keyboard and go 6/7/2 (a net even score) while he's trolling in a game he doesn't care about winning? What was the point of Riot going out of their way to make us sign a waiver, as a condition of playing their game, to actually try to win games that we play if there's seemingly no system in place to enforce that rule? Or to punish other forms of blatant trolling?

And on that note, would a little bit more transparency with how your reports are handled kill the folks at Riot? Why is the system set up such that they only give you vague feedback when a troll in your games is punished for something that you maybe reported him for, or maybe not you don't know, if the game where you reported them is only a part of your last three games? I don't understand that. Personally, I'd like to know who it was, what champ they were on, and what their punishment was, and a rundown of the steps taken to arrive at that punishment (Automated review, manual review, community review, manual review, player review, manual review, punishment, or some such) at LEAST, so that I actually feel like my complaints are being heard by a company with more than enough resources to hear them. And fuck me, I could create a system which a company like this could use to just check a box and send it to the next step in the process, and I've only got MAYBE year and a half of software design experience. Fuck me, I could build it as a webapp and GIVE the bitch to Riot if they'd actually use it! Free of charge!

And why would it be so impossible to consider the context in which things are said when they dish out punishment for chat, if they're going to give even self-admitted trolls every possible chance at reforming themselves, even seemingly going so far as to read ""yeah idc about winning the game"" as an isolated sentence with no context, that's just banter between teams, not deserving of punishment for the rather obvious violation of the rules that they agreed to follow?

This isn't a rant post, per se, and if the mods wanna ask me to re-write this with less of a call-out tone, I will, I genuinely want to understand why troll picks aren't punishable, and have a discourse with the community about how Riot could make a system that actually punishes players for trolling, and that better rewards players for reporting players who deliberately ruin games, in a way that helps players to learn and identify reportable behaviors. I'd even go so far as to wager that if Riot listened to the genuine, good faith feedback from the community on this one, it could lead to a system which removes much of the overt toxicity from the game, and lowers the sheer number of reports. Idk. Anyway, Reddit, do your thing and rip me a new one for no reason LMAO.

Okay, challenge accepted.

Top- FREJLORIDIAN BARD WITH THE SPIRIT OF AN OPERA SINGER WARRIOR

This unassuming Frejlordian bard is haunted by a mighty warrior in his horn, whose memory only survives through the songs of an opera. He's like Gnar but both forms are melee, and his ult is to blow his horn to activate his bigger opera warrior form immediately. When his passive bar (which rises through farming or hitting abilities on champions) fills up, you hear a haunting tune in the BGM which becomes steadily louder and then explodes to the forefront after his form change. The benefit of ulting early is that it doesn't fill his passive bar, so you could potentially double the duration of your larger form. If you fill it up while your form is large, the music becomes EVEN MORE DRAMATIC.

&amp;#x200B;

Jungle - SINISTER WANDERING FLUTIST ASSASSIN

Another form-change champ, only this one is like Elise or Nidalee, where she can change whenever. Normally, he just plays his flute to the creatures of the Jungle to soothe them, before revealing his ALTER EGO FORM CHANGE where he slaughters them because actually the flute is a knife! Nothing personal, kid. The ult is a charm, sort of a Pied Piper of Hamelin deal. You know how Evelynn's W has the charm activate after the mark fills up? The has you charm the person until the mark fills up, and you only deal damage if you reactivate it at that specific point in time, where you do a dramatic slash.

&amp;#x200B;

Mid - MASTER THIEF PUNK STAR ZAUNITE

This girl is not having the best time. She's poor, she's dirty, her street performances -as awesome as they are - get overlooked every day, and she hears voices in her head. One day, they lead her to a treasure trove of machinery - with the promise of leading her to more. The voice's only condition is that she must extract the crystals and hoarde them. No questions asked. She's an auto-reliant Mage whose abilities revolve around kiting her opponents with illusions. Kind of like attack speed Neeko only, you know, NOT an accident. Her auto attacks become stronger the more she autos (straight up has Orianna's passive), she has an auto reset, she has a backslide that moves her backwards while leaving a trail of damage, she leaves controllable clones that deal more damage to opponent the more 'convincing' her performances with them are, and her ult uses hextech crystals to knock her opponents away with a loud noise from her speakers.

&amp;#x200B;

ADC - It's just Jhin. Come on. Like. Come on. He's even obsessed with the most basic time signature. His autos are stuck on a specific rhythm. Do I really need to convince you. Just dress him up as a Maestro. Or like. The Phantom of the Opera. He already has the mask.

Support - BIG NOXIAN DRUMMER BOI

A THICC Alistar-esque Support Tank with a massive drum. The E builds up stacks similar to Alistar's, and at full stacks, it empowers one of his other abilities Applies a brief knock-up to surrounding enemies with a big BANG of his drum on W; an empowered W does bigger damage and CC. Q rolls him forward in a straight line - empowered Q STARTS the root with a root around BIG DRUMMER BOI. His ult has him perform a crazy drum solo which empowers allies around him, increasing their movespeed and giving them all a fat shield (LET'S DROP THE BEAT).",1609497779

I just wanted to know peoples thoughts and peoples opinions about this topic as I really want them to come back due to my main/s having prestige skins but I wasn’t playing league when they came out so I think it’s unfair how I never got the chance to be able to obtain them any other way but from gambling and yet I’ve tried and never gotten any success, as of yet. 

Speaking of that though, since I don’t own prestige skins for any of my mains I can’t say the ones I do have hold much value to me as I don’t play them but bought it for more of an exclusive skin. Speaking of such I was wondering if they did bring them back would this upset those who may have worked hard by grinding out points to get them? Although a counter argument could be what if the older ones cost more? 150-200 prestige points so then it still is more exclusive and you can’t buy as many? 

I just wanted to address the rumours and ask if anyone has any information and can link sources to it that would be very helpful ^^ and please do have discussions below as I’m always grateful to hear other peoples prospectives and opinions. 

I don’t think they will bring them back as much as I do want them too as I do think it’s unfair to the people who did get the skins the fair way. But also owning some prestige skins I wouldn’t mind letting others be able to purchase them if it was available to do so.",1609498301

leagueoflegends,2021,1,This is crazy. I got 100 subs just editing some pyke plays. Thank you so much ❤️,1609500276
leagueoflegends,2021,1,"For some background I'm mostly a support main, used to play Ahri with Twin Shadows and Hextech Gunblade. I love the idea of supporting my teammates since I do not have high reflex and I find champions with high skill ceiling like Zed or Irelia a little bit confusing.  Used to play Lissandra and Quinn (both top/mid) since they could roam around the map and help with map control. But now I find them to be kinda sluggish and Lissandra's movement speed is kinda slow so roaming isn't possible.

 Do you have other champs for my playstyle? Simple enough but can still support team in case I'm behind.",1609500826

leagueoflegends,2021,1,"I really shouldn't have to explain, but I'll give a brief explanation that's straight to the point anyway. 

Blitzcrank's Q is already one of the most powerful CC's in the game, only it's 5x stronger in ARAM. The victim is almost always going to die from it because Blitzcrank's entire team is always near him to follow-up on the grab + E knock-up.

It's the most frustrating thing to play against.",1609501491

leagueoflegends,2021,1,"Now it's harder than usual because they just go afk for anything. I ping my toplane that tanks 2 waves and the enemy Nasus  to go back, dies and is 0-2 now ""I afk because u ping me"" and then shouting all chat "" Twitch put me behind"" , i was never in his lane but enemy says they will report me.

Gank midlane  who is 1-3 and hold onto my E until enemy is out of my midlaner spells  and get the kill ,"" WHY U KS ME"" and then they go afk.  
Ganked my midlane who was not losing (6-1) and he went directly afk because i walked into his lane.

Another game my jungler went afk because i was not supposed to gank lanes and the only things he can do is farm and get drakes and there are no kills left for him.

My random adc i get rarely complain about my pick because i always keep them really fed but every other lane is a fiesta of mental trainwrecks.

And there is nothing i can do about that and the fact that people agrees with them and i get reported every bad match they have, just getting stuff of my chest at this point because nothing will be done.

I just want them to stop doing  that and play.",1609502278

leagueoflegends,2021,1,[removed],1609503047
leagueoflegends,2021,1,"So I have some thoughts. Let's say Thresh and Quinn were on the same team on Summoner's Rift and Thresh threw his lantern to Quinn to shield/bubble her during a heated fight with an enemy champion. Now let's say Quinn dashed towards the enemy champion using E while still being in the protective bubble/shield, by dashing to the enemy champion, she is literally in the enemy's face, so my question is this, since the souls are actively shielding her in a bubble during this time, what impact would it have on the enemy champion, when she is dashing right into them with E? Won't the shield/bubble (in theory) collide with the enemy champion that she is dashing to? What or how it would feel like being hit by the shield from the perspective of the champion that is fighting Quinn in this scenario? Would the shield/bubble make any sort of collision and/or impact with the enemy champion upon her dashing to said enemy? Of course I am not asking from a gameplay perspective, but rather trying to make sense of it from a lore perspective.",1609503337

leagueoflegends,2021,1,"I play League for a while now, I remember my first skin being Chosen Master Yi, I love star Wars and this was a obvious inspiration on Star Wars skin. But I always wonder why LOL does not make collabs, for example in Japan i think it would be successful a collab with the Fate series since the premise of summoner and legends working together are similar. 

Why Fortnite can make skins of the Mandalorian and other media like Borderlands and Walking Dead but lol never collabs, they sure make inspiration skins for example Spirit Blossom Riven is a nod to Susano Sasuke of Naruto. Does it disturb the game ambient? We have pop star and K pop skins does it really matter? 

Some champions would make great star Wars skins especially now with the Star Wars fever of the Mandalorian. Is it hard to mix the champion kit with the lore of the franchise? 

Smite did this with Avatar the Last Airbender and I think it worked fine.

leagueoflegends,2021,1,"So far, it seems that with some more adjustments the goal of giving every class different mythic options game to game can be met. But it's come at the cost of alienating champions whose builds fall in between or outside of classes, more than they'd already been. 

Namely: Gangplank, Gnar, Yasuo, Yone, and Tryndamere. 

We'll set aside Tryndamere, since his passive and ultimate make him the least vulnerable to item changes. Unlike Yasuo or Yone, he doesn't have to buy crit to have it and as such doesn't have to build it at all if fighter items become better.

And Yasuo and Yone have already received buffs, but more importantly the Mythic passives of the marksmen items they have to buy suit them. Shieldbow essentially replaced the old Phantom Dancer and provides defense on top of that, or Kraken Slayer provides more AS and can be stacked by their Q's. Even with those aside, it'd be a simple matter of readjusting their crit bonus to account for the per-item reduction.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, for the two it hurt more.

Gnar's in the same boat he's always been in, being a marksman most of the time who turns into a tank instead of a damage dealer like other transforming champs. Which I think should be adjusted somehow but has been exacerbated by these changes. Marksman items still won't work because he still needs to be able to survive in Mega, but now his core item-- Frozen Mallet-- has been removed completely. Sunderer, though it does have health, doesn't suit him well since he only has two long-cooldown abilities to proc it in mini *and* its damage is penalized for being ranged. 

Gangplank's main issues stem from sheen and being melee. He lost a ton of mana with the recipe change, and none of the sheen options suit him. Sunderer doesn't apply its %HP damage or heal if you use it on barrels, and the Mythic passive is heavily reduced when combined with his barrels because of how %armor pen stacks. He has no synergy with AS and difficulty continuously attacking, so both Trinity's new passive and mythic passive work poorly on him. For the same reason, he can't build Essence Reaver even though it's now a sheen item, and no longer suits most of the crit items because he can't afford to sink 3 items worth of gold into it now that the stat itself relies more on attack speed. 

&amp;#x200B;

The solution is probably going to have to be mini-reworks to the two of them, since they don't have the mechanics to just do stat changes like the other three. But regardless of what Riot decides to do, they do need to do something.",1609506779

leagueoflegends,2021,1,"Basically, any champion that relies on healing in their kit is now useless, while champion that build multiple vamp items (omnivamp and lifesteal) and use all the vamp runes heal usually so much that sometimes it's really better to invest into ways to oneshot them instead of gw that feels useless against them anyway. So we need grevious wounds to be more punishing for vamp effects, while not throwing healing champions even more into the gutter. 

This would have to be precisely balanced by the numbers, but to illustrate, I was thinking something along the lines of 30/30 for the basic items (resulting in total 51% reduction for champions getting their heal from vamp) and 50/50 for full effects (resulting in total 75% healing reduction for champions getting their heal from vamp)

This would help a bit currently struggling healing champions, while further affecting things that get ridiculous healing just from runes and items. Goredrinker would be buffed by these changes, but if goredrinker alone is the problem, there's nothing easier than nerfing the active. Also the changes coming in next patch look promising already.

I don't know if this is the best way, but I'm certainly getting sick of the way thing currently are, and I'm not alone.",1609508492

leagueoflegends,2021,1,"Hey everyone! I’m really interested in making the switch to LoL. I’m a long time MOBA player, specifically Smite. I’ve been playing since the game was released and I’ve generally been a diamond player so I’m quite comfortable within these genre of games.

However, I know nothing about LoL. Never played it or watched any videos on it whatsoever but I really want to get into it. Any tips on where to start?

I’m a hardcore competitive gamer that’s played on teams and in leagues for Smite so I’m more than willing to put the time and effort in to learn the various champions and items in this game but I recently read that there’s like 140 different champions. Who do I start playing first? (Smite ADC Main) What game modes are best to play for someone with MOBA experience but still needs to figure out the game? Any good suggestions for websites with builds on them or specific content creators to watch? Also, will any of my Smite knowledge transfer over to LoL and give me an edge on other new players or are they so different that it doesn’t matter?

I haven’t even loaded up the game for the first time and I already feel very overwhelmed by the whole thing, yet at the same time I’m so excited to learn everything. Any help would be appreciated! Thank you to anyone and everyone that takes the time to read this post. I appreciate all of you.

Edit; Wow, thank you to everyone who responded! I got a lot of great suggestions and I’m looking forward to putting them to good use. Hopefully I’ll see you all in game soon!",1609509764

leagueoflegends,2021,1,"It has been 5 years since I played for the first time and my journey ended in plat4 78 lp, it was enough.

So why did I quit?

1. terrible matchmaking experience, unbalace. There wasn't single game where at least 1 person wasn't toxic. I won't talk about OTP Irelia and autofilled top. The game is basically telling you to play as team, but how can you cooperate with someone that basically wants to just destroy your day. feeders, toxic players, egoistic players, every single game.
2. Champion balance. We all know that being  metaslave is the only way to enjoy League. For me, playing champions that I like and I'm good at, playing against 70% winrate champ is straight unfun.
3. Champion/skin releases. Last season or so, it seems like Riot got bought by Disney. 2nd KD/A, just why.

Last words are, that League when you try to be better is just unfun, especially this preseason. I've spent 2.5k hours on this game, so I know what I'm saying. I like to watch League, but hate to play it. But good things it thought me are : patience, you have to wait for something in order to achieve it. Vision of me getting better at something, that I can be better in that game. Strong mental, knowing that getting mad won't solve anything and keeping focused is the only way to win games/solve problems. Ability to talk, negotiate and interact with imbeciles, egoists, ignorants, angry people, shittalkers, toxic people, bad players and straight assholes, is the best thing I learned. Few ways to talk to these kinds of people, getting them to cooperate or just to listen. Most of the time I had to show them their place, tell them to not behave like kids on playground and telling them to man up and focus to win the game and adding it's their mmr, lp and time too. Most of the time it worked and they actually were good players. It was just enough to spill my cup of patience. Peace out.",1609514486

leagueoflegends,2021,1,"**Funfire Wincape is still picked most of the time despite the nerfs.** Meanwhile, Frostfire Gauntlet and Turbo Chemtank remain severely underplayed. And no sheer number nerfs are going to change why it happened. Because **Frostfire Gauntlet and Turbo Chemtank effects are just meh.** That's it. They're useless for the class that they're supposedly destined for. Redundant with what tank kits already have.

First, let's list all the champions who are supposed to build Bami's Cinder and its upgrades:

* Tanks - Top: Malphite, Maokai, Ornn, Sion, Shen, Poppy
* Tanks - Jungle: Amumu, Sejuani, Nunu, Zac, Rammus, Gragas
* Fighters (mostly Juggernauts and junglers): Volibear, Dr. Mundo, Shyvana, Sett, Jarvan IV, Warwick, Skarner
* Cho'Gath (he's a Specialist, so not really bound to any class)
 
And here's an observation: Tanks almost never build anything else than Sunfire, the only ones who go Frostfire Gauntlet are Volibear and Cho'Gath, likewise for Turbo Chemtank which is Skarner's pick of choice. This proves the point that these items, while situationally viable, are not for Tanks, but other classes. Even the dedicated armor stackers Malphite and Rammus never really choose FG.

Frostfire Gauntlet is a great item for Cho'Gath, and Juggernauts like Shyvana or Volibear - champions who otherwise lack reliable CC in their kit.

Turbo Chemtank is a great item for Skarner, and some supports due to Shurelya being garbage.

**Both Gauntlet and Chemtank are just not made for tanks.** Tanks already have slows and engage in their kits, these effects are redundant with their spell patterns. FG and BC are neat for some offtanks, but mostly useless for true tanks.

#Why nerfing Sunfire wasn't enough

The problem with Sunfire isn't even that it's a specialized DPS item in a class that isn't supposed to be a main DPS dealer. The problem with Sunfire is that it's actually **too good of a generalist item**. It's equally good against all kinds of damage. Even if you need to specialize into a specific resist, **Sunfire+boots is a better choice than the resist-specific Mythic**. This is the other fundamental flaw of Gauntlet and Chemtank - they're awkwardly balanced between statline and effects, rarely ever optimal for the situation. Skarner purchases Chemtank despite the awful statline only because he wants the active all that much.

Think about it: **Even after the nerf** of Sunfire to 350 health, it's still a better item against magic damage than Frostfire Gauntlet (by 5 MR) and a better item against physical damage than Turbo Chemtank (by 5 armor). Sunfire will always remain the numbingly default option if this isn't addressed.

#Consider unifying defensive stats of all tank Mythics

This works in Mage Mythics. This works in AD Mythics. This works in Enchanter Mythics. The only outliers are sustain-providing ones (Riftmaker, Eclipse, Shieldbow). Establish a successful statline for the items, then make the players truly choose the unique effect of a specific Mythic.

For Tanks, this should be 400 Health, 30 Armor, 30 Magic Resist, 20 Ability Haste. Of course Gauntlet and Chemtank would need more powerful effects, then - but that's exactly the point. Effects that play into the tank fantasy of enduring damage, disabling opponents and protecting allies, not this ""mage bruiser"" DPS bullshit.

#Make Gauntlet and Chemtank unique effects more unique and impactful

Every Mythic item should change how you play the game, either adding something essential to your combo (Rocketbelt, Goredrinker, Duskblade, Harvester, Galeforce, Locket) or permanently enhancing your existing patterns (Mandate, Liandry's, Riftmaker, Krakenslayer, Triforce/Sunderer). Currently, tank Mythics don't really do that, mostly because they're doing a shit job at being Mythics for tanks. Gauntlet is a Juggernaut item and Chemtank is a bastard child of Shurelya's and old Randuin's.

Tank Mythics should assume that their user can already engage into the enemy (Vanguards) or is around the allies they want to protect (Wardens) and enhance the qualities they truly care about. Assume they have CC already and don't need the slows. Assume they want to get hit.

In comparison, other class Mythics make the user choose between the mobility&amp;burst, (anti-tank) DPS, or survivability. Let's try to follow that pattern here as well, but from the other side - tanks aren't supposed to be the ones dealing DPS or burst damage, but dealing WITH that damage. Consider the following:

* Frostfire Gauntlet becomes the anti-burst option. Think Malphite/Galio passive shield that serves as a soft taunt: while the shield holds, your basic attacks deal bonus on-hit damage. In tune with the item's name and theme, you choose between Physical or Magical shield by item toggle, which also switches between armor-scaling physical damage and MR-scaling magical damage, you get the point. It also plays into one of tank strengths: punishing enemies for stacking one type of damage.
* Sunfire due to its name and theme should remain the DPS option... but **stacking with enemy DPS instead**. Enemy team bought Liandry's? Perfect, you'll stack Sunfire in no time. You burn, they burn, it all burns. The Shurima Ascended theme makes it also a much better fit for %size passive.
* Turbo Chemtank can remain tied to mobility, but as we've discussed, only the likes of Skarner will utilize it as a main engage tool. It needs a secondary purpose as well in order to become a true tank item. Again, soft taunt - enemy team should feel encouraged to stop you and force you to finish your engage early.

#The Support Clause

The itemization landscape isn't complete without considering the tank Supports. At the moment some of them can opt for Chemtank as a possible purchase for the engage potential given the low appeal of Shurelya's. Long story short, Shurelya's needs a buff for low-income Supports to have a choice between more than one item; another concern is low power of post-nerf Knight's Vow and poor choice of 2300g support defensive items overall, but let's not jump ahead too far.

The weakness of Shurelya's, however, is part of the Chemtank problem - some supports like Blitzcrank or Tahm Kench can consider Chemtank for the engage potential, it's just so damn expensive. They would be pretty happy with Shurelya's if only it wasn't so horribly inefficient.

leagueoflegends,2021,1,"I was in a flex queue with some friends, and my PC crashed. It took from minute 14:30 to minute 22:00 for me to load it back up, start league again and load into the game (I checked on the replay). I rushed to restart it and log back into the game, and we managed to win that game pretty easy, but I was marked as an AFK so I got -8LP (for a game that we WON, that I was there for the majority of it, the afk time was exactly what it took me to boot it back up). I was in shock because I didn't even know you could lose LP for winning if you got a PC crash, so I'm genuenly asking:

Is there a point in logging back into a game if your PC crashes? Doesn't this feed negativity into the player base if your PC crashes?? ""Why would I bother logging back in if I'm going to get punished no matter what?"" is what I thought. Why bother rushing back if my team can win but it will still count as a defeat for me? The penalty for AFK is too much:

1. Probably getting reported/yelled at, if those things affect you.
2. LP loss no matter if you win or not.
3. No progress for your quests, basically that game didn't exist for my race to Prestige Diana when it should have given me 10 tokens.
4. No honor after the game even if you did amazing.

leagueoflegends,2021,1,"Hey guys I'm Minishcap1, I've been maining Singed since Season 3 and have [peaked/maintained challenger in multiple seasons, including Season 10.](https://na.op.gg/summoner/userName=minishcap1) 

Now Singed has always been countered hard by lifesteal/sustain mechanics. Now this is generally fine because heals are meant to counter DoT damage, but this preseason healing has been so present in every game, and so overturned that poison trail, his main damage dealing tool feels like it's just never going to do enough damage. 

[Take this clip for example](https://streamable.com/id047c). The enemy champions tanked almost my **entire** 25 second ultimate duration, strolling through poison trail, while healing hundreds of hp every few seconds. Sylas didn't even itemize for healing at all, building armor, and Wukong lost his lane heavily, while also having 0 magic resistance. I even had a demonic embrace. The crazy part was that I was pretty fed for a Singed at this stage in the game. Healing is just so strong that Signed and champs similar to him, like Morde, get gimped out of so many kills even when piloting their champs very well. 

I can back this up with stats:

[From Lolalytics: Singed's stats from patch 10.22 (final Season 10 patch)](https://i.imgur.com/tSKEb2h.png)

As we can see, at the end of Season 10, Singed's average kills per game was 4.35, and his max kill spree was 2.12. In addition, his average total damage was 18,108 damage per game.

[Also from Lolalytics: Singed's stats for the current patch 10.25 (Preseason 11)](https://i.imgur.com/Gtnn0NZ.png)

We can see here that Singed's average kills dropped to 3.92, max kill spree dropped to 1.82, and his average total damage dropped to 16.991. His winrate also dropped from 51.5% to 49%.

So not only did Singed lose a ton of damage per game, he also is getting less kills and is popping off in less games due to a lower killing spree. This is party due to DoT items being much weaker this season compared to old Rylais/Liandry combo, but also due to the huge amount of healing the game.

Singed and Morde are currently suffering hard from a lack of good itemization getting slapped by healing. This is not even a question of grievous wounds either. Singed is among the best applicators of grievous wounds in the game. Poison trail debuff lasts for 2 seconds, extending the duration of grievous wounds from 2 to 4, and Demonic ticks for 4 seconds extending the duration to 8 seconds. 

It's not really an issue with his kit either. I can still get into a teamfight just fine. I can still fling the right target and ground the right targest and still run around and spread my poison perfectly, but because of the healing enemy champions just don't die. It really sucks to pop ult ghost and Predator to run at the enemy carry, sidestep all of the enemy CCs, and get the perfect W + Fling combo only to see them get a massive shield from Shieldbow and start healing to full health in a few autos.

Items are also an issue because we were led to believe that there would be plenty of AP bruiser items but in reality there are only 3, rift demonic and rylais. Out of those 3, Riftmaker has been gutted for AP bruisers and Demonic doesn't apply enough damage. Rylais is very reliable but is not a damage dealing item as much as it is a utility item.

I'm trying to bring attention to this because the AP bruiser class is suffering hard right now. If you go on /r/singedmains the entire subreddit reads like a depression therapy session, and rightfully so. It sucks to main DoT champs right now.",1609520127

leagueoflegends,2021,1,"So I was playing Darius (Goredrinker, DD, Steraks) in an Aram with 4 adcs in my team (Graves, Ashe, Jhin &amp; Twitch) against Velkoz, Poke Varus and Jax (dont remember the other two). Because of their range I felt quite useless if I didnt have snowball up or they dodged it or i missed it. Other than Ashe R my Snowball into e was the only engage we had I felt. Early game I wasnt tanky enough to be focused  by all 5 enemies and im not good on Bruisers anyway (On SR I´m supp main and mostly play tanky engage Champs like Naut/leona and Amumu in jgl if I get filled). My 4 adcs managed to trade my death for 2 to 3 kills. So for our team these engages were fine but I wasnt doing particulary well gold wise. 

Some time later Jax came online (Triforce, BotrK and Steraks). He and Varus had the most kills and were the most threatening. One time when Jax was about the jump into the 4 adcs I had the option to snowball onto the Jax or onto the Varus. I chose the first to pull him away from the squishies. But after that a teammate why I´m focusing on the ""tank"" because ""it takes you forever to kill him"". He was ofc right - I couldnt kill him 1v1, but i thought maybe he can kill them 1v4 if they all get stunned by him. And I couldnt oneshot the Varus I felt. 

So - am I missing something or was he wrong there?

And: How does that translate to a teamfight in SR where there are 4 squishies and something like a Darius in a team and a diver in the enemy team? Ofc Darius (especially with Goredrinker) thrives when fighting in the midst of a lot of enemies because of q but unless he can 1v4/1v5 if the whole backline dies to the enemy diver it doesnt matter in the end. Just curious about your thoughts. 

&amp;#x200B;

Ofc I could have gone Aftershock and do the snowball into e play but I didnt want to play full tank (its aram...). We won the game in the end anyway so no hard feelings against my teammate.

it always makes me think every year if i shuld come back 'cos i didn't find a competitive game which was as good as S3 LoL; i find the more balanced games boring or team reliant and the only reason to play them is the fun of winning; it's like i didn't find a replacement yet so i am still looking

what's reason LoL is still popular? not mentiong addiction; 2-3 million players every day

it's casual friendly but there are other casual games too and only minecraft and fortnite beats the numbers of LoL

so what's the secret of LoL? shuld i come back? i heard the game will be more broken than ever in s11 and it will be the worst season ever but even if the game gets worse every season it still stays popular; the reason cannot be just addiction",1609524712

So, I've been playing lol for quite some time now and although I love the game I just feel so frustrated knowing my experience would be so much better if they just implemented this little change. The thing is, as the game is right now I play it with quick cast and overall it is quite good, but I really wanted to be able to see the range of my skills, and be clicking around whenever I want without it to be canceled.  I hate the way cast with indicators is right now.

leagueoflegends,2021,1,"So I have some thoughts. Let's say Thresh and Quinn were on the same team on Summoner's Rift and Thresh threw his lantern to Quinn to shield/bubble her during a heated fight with an enemy champion. Now let's say Quinn dashed towards the enemy champion using E while still being in the protective bubble/shield, by dashing to the enemy champion, she is literally in the enemy's face, so my question is this, since the souls are actively shielding her in a bubble during this time, what impact would it have on the enemy champion, when she is dashing right into them with E? Won't the shield/bubble (in theory) collide with the enemy champion that she is dashing to? What or how it would feel like being hit by the shield from the perspective of the champion that is fighting Quinn in this scenario? Would the shield/bubble make any sort of collision and/or impact with the enemy champion upon her dashing to said enemy? Of course I am not asking from a gameplay perspective, but rather trying to make sense of it from a lore perspective.",1609529477

leagueoflegends,2021,1,"Grievous Wounds items do their intended purpose of reducing sustain; the problem is, they are otherwise weak and completely inferior to other items. They are cost inneficient and provide less stats than other similar items.

Also, with the exception of Thornmail, none of the Grievous Wounds items have any passives other than inflicting Grievous Wounds on enemies. Even Thornmail's passive is really weak; it is a shadow of what it used to be (it used to deal a lot more damage back to an enemy).

Why this is a problem? Because healing/vamp/lifesteal items are good. They have things other than sustain on them, and are efficient items. Ravenous Hydra, for example, is 106% gold efficient. In addition to giving omnivamp to the user, it also provides waveclear. Blade of the Ruined King is almost always cost efficient, as the target needs to have 300 current health (for melees) or 400 (for rangeds) for it to become efficient; in addition to giving lifesteal, it also provides two powerful passives. It is a fantastic item for dueling.

Sustain items are probably items you would want to get even if they had no sustain at all. I am pretty sure a lot of champions would like to have waveclear or on-hit % current health damage. Not to mention, sustain is present in runes too.

Compare that to the Grievous Wounds items. For example... Morellonomicon allows you to inflict Grievous Wounds to enemies and... nothing else. It is a very cost inneficient item (you pay more for this item than what its stats are worth in gold). Chempunk Putrifier also only gives Grievous Wounds and nothing else, it is also a gold inneficient item; other than Grievous Wounds, it is just an inferior Black Cleaver.

If weren't for the excessive sustain, no one would even bother with those items.

Before the pre season, those items used to have good things for them other than Grievous Wounds. For example, Mortal Reminder had a lot of armor penetration (helping you combat tanks), Morellonomicon had flat magic penetration to help you with bursting enemies, and Thornmail had a higher amount of reflected damage.

Those issues are made even worse by the fact that, thanks to healing being omnipresent, you still have to purchase those items every game. Imagine if, for example, every game had a champ with suppression. It would be shitty because QSS and its upgrades are actually mediocre items and they are only purchased to counter suppression. The difference is, because suppression is not omnipresent, it is not that much a problem if once every 10 games, you have to purchase it. Now imagine if every game you had to purchase an extremely inneficient item to counter something that is supposed to not be in every battle. That is what Grievous Wounds items feel like.

To solve this problem, Riot has three options:

* Reduce the healing on items and runes, so that Grievous Wounds become situtional purchases (as they should be).
* Remove Grievous Wounds, remove all current Grievous Wounds items except Thornmail (which should then be reverted to its 5.16 version), and balance all existing sustain around it not existing.
* Buff Grievous Wounds items, either by giving them better stats, or by making them have other good passives, so that they aren't terrible purchases on their own.",1609534161

leagueoflegends,2021,1,"league is too big to die on its own , but when it finally does , it will be due to devs constantly trying to one up each other . honestly at times it feels like there is an internal competition at riot to see who can fuck up the game the hardest and get away with it . its always the excuse of "" we are just a small slice of the player base"" , which is true  , but you telling me everyone in KR and China enjoy this excessive healing and one shotting ? the answer is no . one quick look at their posts and you will realize that this kind of league of legends (everything turned up to 11) is disliked by almost everyone . the correct step from here is actually acknowledge this is an issue , rather than doubling down on a mistake and force everyone to embrace this state of game . league loses a huge chunk of its complexity and gameplay when everything one shots everything ... if only more devs were like riot gortok. when him and his team realized the new ranked system they worked on for 2 years wasnt working well with the player base , he didnt say we worked 2 years on it so shove it down their throat and let them cope with it . instead , gortok and his team reverted everything back ... those are the true devs at riot that keep this ship afloat , and i hope these younger devs who constantly battle on reddit posts learn a thing or two from them .  


anyway , sorry about the rant , happy new year !",1609535026

leagueoflegends,2021,1,"So, we have all complained about master yi in the past at least once. Whether it's funnel or just yi dealing 70% true damage to a tank, we all have been there. But during those times, he was punishable by good dps comps that just kill him, point and click cc you can use after he gets out of q or even a skillshot cc that you land. Like he always was a scary force but at least he ran at you q'd your spell and then aa you to death.

Lehality duskblade/collector/navori yi is something else though. I can't say that he is like grossly overpowered or smth like that. He has his weakness which is earlygame but if he somehow gets out of it ahead (for example getting a single kill out of a lost dragon fight) he just starts doing disgusting shit. First: duskblade. Due to this item he has the ability to go invisible after killing your adc. Like i get it the item is not grossly op but combined with his q its just aids. He spends way too much time untargetable. I know that you can hit him while he's invisible but he can run away from where the target died and also some of his skins have really bad visual clarity of where he exactly ends up after his q. Also some abilities are targeted and you can't gold card a yi or liss ult him while he is invis.

Duskblade wouldn't be such a problen if it weren't for navori and collector though. Collector just gives him the stats needed to oneshot people but navori is a whole different level of broken on him. When he hits this item, he starts spending half of the fights in his q. It's frustrating and really hard to play against and I really hope something is done about lethality yi.

To be honest, my best bet would be just gutting his ad and crit scaling and maybe reverting some of his older nerfs to his onhit build which is not as strong anymore.",1609538209

leagueoflegends,2021,1,"Both Hecarim and Ekko's E spells interact very weirdly with the snowball summoner(mark/dash) in aram. If you cast your e before dashing you will automatically waste your spell by autoing the target you dash to immediately. I tested this with aa's on and off and every time the spell is wasted. What is even more annoying is sometimes even if you cast the skill after dashing with the snowball you will still use your aa on the target you dashed to without giving a command for it. 

What I noticed is your character always tries to aa the target you dashed to even if aa is off but you can cancel it with movement commands if the aa isn't instant like hecarim or Ekko's case.

leagueoflegends,2021,1,"Yes, damage is crazy high, and healing is in an arms race against it. But I don’t know why Riot is so hesitant to give shields the same treatment that healing is getting. For example, there isn’t a single shield item that scales with AP, and Seraph’s shield was removed and even that scaled with mana (RIP my sweet prince).

I feel like maybe shields can bring a dynamic that’s more interactive and fun to play with/against in light of the current complaints against all the sources of healing in the game, as shields can be an item active, meaning it takes some decision making rather than functioning passively like many sources of healing in the game, as well as offering a solution to the burst-heal dichotomy since shields can go beyond max hp.

Shields also decay, so there’s some potential interactions with CC. I think the current issue with shields in the game so far is that the lack of scaling makes it so carries can’t rely on shielding to stay alive. I can see potential counterarguments being Ardent Censer meta (although that’s different, since the item doesn’t provide a shield itself) and that scaling shields make a snowballing carry too hard to shut down, although healing kind of has the same problem and shields need to actually be consciously used (snowballing carries can just stat check with all the healing).

leagueoflegends,2021,1,"No matter how many MVPs you get on [op.gg](https://op.gg) you will never ever be capable of making people understand that low-elo is actually a problem at the moment. I have currently been duo que playing in silver as a plat 1 probably diamond level player. It is nearly impossible despite the amount of carries and MVPs as well as just over all great plays to carry the people who are stuck in the elo that they are in thus dragging down experienced players  and causing many players to give up on their attempts at climbing to a serious level due to the players around them. If you are to look at my account there are a few winstreaks where I either had carried or had normal players and they allowed me to play normally which is great in low-elo, however after a while it gets nearly impossible when you get matched with people who have no experience in jungle with an autofill. Honestly if you are auto-filling people in low-elo there is nearly no chance for any player to get better. The concept of putting people into situations that they are incapable of understanding blows my mind and it is an awful idea.  


This is why I am proposing that in low-elo there are higher que timers to put people in the roles that they are actually playing as their dominant role. If a person is willingly putting themselves in the jungle they most likely have a concept of how it works to make it atleast somewhat fair; however, putting low-elo players in an autofilled role of jungle is just unfair to them and the people that are trying to climb. There is no full way to notice that a player is autofilled unless you look them up and with an older generation computer this is nearly impossible due to my computer just not being fast enough nor good enough to handle that many apps open at once due to advertisements. This is my personal change that I would make to solo-que because being in a lane practice makes perfect and the same thing goes for being a jungler.  


This is one of my experiences of a player who was bronze I and had a record of 4-17 and then got autofilled jungle for his FIRST time might I add. No experience playing jungle ever and clearly a new player. The game was over as soon as it started with AMUMU BTW being down 3 levels and 40 cs with 0 ganks completed. Who in their mind is going to not abuse the amumu being awful? It's causing solo-que to be completely based off of everyone's solo experience rather than being the ""team game"" that everyone tries to cover the problem with. There are real problems besides this game being a team game as well as some problems with the client that can be fixed with minor fixes. I feel as though my computer science major speaks for itself when I say I can see the problems in the client as well as the games development due to being a gamer for nearly 10 years strong.   


To continue with the problem at hand there are many different kinds of ways to be toxic and there is not enough management on the end of fixing the banning problem that soft inters and snowflakes can easily dodge with being a quiet nuisance to the game and or ruining everyone else experience over their own mentality. I feel as though games with KDA's lower than .5 should be looked at in everyone instance comparatively to their other games. In most instances where games end early there  are multiple people with bad KDR's and that is a simple solution to getting rid of the players who do not ""try to win"" in ranked games. The concept of intentionally feeding has been thrown around with a grain of salt with many different variations of intensity and this has caused the lower intensities to undergo no punishment. Even if  people do not agree there should be the same punishment there should be some punishment to prevent people from repeat offending.  


To conclude this is my ranked account and my previous account before this that can prove that I was at a Platinum I level

leagueoflegends,2021,1,"Rocketbelt isn't Harvester, Prowler's isn't duskblade, stridebreaker isn't goredrinker, yet riot is balancing their damage together. 

To me, the most ridiculous is prowler's vs duskblade. One is on short cooldown, provides a bit of utility and offers resets with much bigger utility, the other has long ass cooldown, on paper great but in reality very clunky dash, and a damage amp. When those two effects have same damage, duskblade will always be much better. Prowler's, as the premiere single target assassin item, should have much bigger upfront damage than the utility oriented duskblade, that has resets and much shorter cd.

Harvester and rocketbelt are a lot closer, most champs that use one can relatively well use the other, on some it's even just a preference. Still, as rocketbelt is much more utility oriented than harvester, that is just ""more damage"", I think harvester should have slightly bigger damage, or at least the scaling.

Between gore and stride, I think stridebreaker should have bigger damage scaling, or scale some other part of the active off ad. Currently both share the same damage and damage scaling, but goredrinker gets heal scaling with missing health and ad, which is incredibly strong compared to stridebreaker with fixed dash and slow.

I can perhaps understand the two ap items, as a lot of champions can use both, so riot has good data on their performance. However, otherwise, it's puzzling to me why would riot want to keep the relative items in their classes with the same damage, when they have vastly different purposes within the class.",1609546453

Like obviously getting starved out is bad and you always melt if you're behind but I don't really feel like I'm any more or less tanky in games past a certain point in the midgame even when I'm a full item ahead of carries. 

Which isn't to say that things are unbalanced and there are champs like Cho or Sion who can still become crazy tanky because of their kit. But I find that past two items, it doesn't really matter what I build because the health/resistances feel pretty much irrelevant and it's more the passives/kit that matters. I guess cause so much is %hp true damage now that you die in the same amount of time now regardless of whether you have 100 armour / 2,000hp or 150 armour / 3,000hp

Anyone else finding this? The changes to the items on many of the classes feel really impactful but tanks right now feel like you don't really have meaningful defensive choices.",1609546896

leagueoflegends,2021,1,"Like, I don't understand how they are allowed to exist in the game in the state that they are. There's just no counterplay at all to their overloaded kits and every game ends up feeling like you're getting punished just for existing.

It's honestly baffling to me how Riot hasn't addressed this yet. There game simply becomes unfun whenever a champion like that gets picked as it forces the entire match to revolve around their pick.

This ends up creating a pretty toxic experience for the 9 other players, players who often just want to play a game and have fun with their silly, yet balanced picks, because some random tryhard just wants to pick the bullshit champ and run over everyone with their over-the-top and uninteractive play pattern.

It's honestly kind of disgusting that these abominations are allowed to remain the way that they are for some many years just because they sell a shitton of skins while all sucking all the fun out of the game.

And as if that wasn't enough, then we get a whole bunch of new and old overpowered items that are simply broken by design and creates a pretty untolerable experience for most people.

But still, the one thing I just can't stand is when some random ass redditors come into these threads and start throwing out buzzwords like ""splitpusher"" or ""counter-matchup"" that don't mean anything but makes them sound smart to the average reader.",1609547650

I feel that an infernal style skin would, in a way fill that niche. It could be one of those skins that inverts the champions established personality. Instead of skipping through the woods he's there to burn them down.

Abilities:
Iverns passive green circle that appears on jungle camps would be instead a ring of fire.
Q: a fireball 
W: the normal grass with a slightly red tinge and a flickering orange glow.
E: not too much I could think of here so skipping for R: daisy would appear as a burning version of herself with patches of molten rock.

leagueoflegends,2021,1,Hey reddit. I've noticed that there has been a lot of negativity in this subreddit but honestly I've found this years changes more on the positive side for me. I'm an ADC main and for the past 2 years I haven't had as good of an experience with ADC as I have now. This new item Galeforce lets me play ADC much better than I used to. I don't know if its because my positioning is bad or something else but that extra flash and the movement speed you get from the mythic passive is helping me a lot. I don't know how to explain it but it just feels like I'm actually playing a role where I impact the game more. I feel like a very squishy yet slippery and fast moving champion that does damage. I feel like ADC should've always been like this. Characters that get killed easily but are very quick and deal damage. I'm loving this change so much that I haven't really taken a break from league yet. I know many people probably don't agree with me and think the item is useless but I'm honestly loving it and I'm glad riot is giving us ADC's more options for our build path.,1609551718

Anyway off topic I was worried about sucking so much it would turn me away from the game but I feel like I'm currently doing alright, I've had games where I've carried, where I've comeback from behind to carry and gotten destroyed. I've been watching videos on marco on when the best time is to recall and the macro stuff in mid game when everyone is normally roaming as that's where I seem to fall off. I said in the other post I feel bad about not hitting 10cs per min but got told it's unlikely anyone will hit it normally (other than pros of course).

leagueoflegends,2021,1,"You know, meaning his gameplay would either revolve around basic attack or be in-between that and ability usage.

For example:

Yi focuses around autos, since two of his abilities make his auto job better with a gap closer, and a true damage buff.

While Wukong is a bit in between, needing to use abilities as part of his damage output with his autos being the 2nd half of his damage, stuff like that (I think, not sure if that’s true in the case of Wukong).

Or maybe needing abilities to do most of the job despite autos being the main damage dealer of the kit.

In the case of Udyr, if there is one thing besides his animal stances that people would like to have in a rework, it’ll be his auto attacking focused style.

But what kind though?

leagueoflegends,2021,1,"I have been playing a lot of Nexus Blitz lately to grind out the event pass and overall I'd say I really enjoy it as a more casual game mode where I can actually play the champs I want. However, even in its latest iteration it still has huge problems that Riot for some reason has done nothing about since the last time it's been around.

&amp;#x200B;

* The system that is supposed to balance where events happen still doesn't work. Sometimes a team is barely behind and the event starts in their jungle, sometimes a team is even ahead and the battle royale ends in front of their guardian, etc. Honestly  they could just make the events always happen in the middle of the map, cause I don't think it's possible to balance gold lead vs event location properly.
* The Yordle events are bullshit and need to go. They always wander off into one or the other team's jungle or under their tower and 90% of the time that just means that team wins that event. Getting gold for hitting is also really stupid when teams have high DPS champs that can quickly (solo) kill the Yordle and get 5k gold for it.
* The event buffs are very unbalanced between each other.  Some, like the Blitzcrank hooks, are borderline useless, while Elder and Ocean Soul provide a huge advantage and are also extremely unfun to play against. This is especially frustrating in combination with unfair event spawns.
* This is somewhat subjective but to me lane feels way stronger than jungle. In lane you actually get to fight your opponent and try to get a lead, while in jungle you're stuck clearing camps for 2 minutes until you maybe contest red or scuttle (though I have never had a fun fight over red buff when I played jungle and scuttle is really about whose lanes are winning). Ganking also doesn't feel very good, as a laner you ward one bush and because lanes are so short you're basically ungankable unless you're getting tower-dived. There are also no significant objectives to contest as jungler except herald which usually doesn't spawn until one team has basically won.

leagueoflegends,2021,1,"am not going to lie I was one of the people that said he was bad when he first came out

now? my goodness lmfao. time your knock up with your R. literally perma CC death, its like two yasuo ults where he gets to land autos while your also cced. twice except he does a lot more damage. hes absolutely too strong at the moment lol. you can't even itemize against him because of Kraken slayer if your a squishy. and he does a decent chunk of magic damage

its quite incredible how oppressive his E is and how good in all situation it is. I remember when they were in the champion spotlight saying you shouldn't use it if your gonna get a bad trade, but hell nah, if hes gonna lose a trade, he will just use his E to get away and wait for his cooldowns to come back up 

the move speed on his E insane, and the amount of damage this champion does from basically everything is insane, get perma cc aoe killed by a hyper carry. literal aids atm thats am gonna start to perma ban

people have figured out how to play him and layer his CC. I don't think a hypr carry should be as strong as he is, his attack speed is bonkers he literally kills people by using R to get near them and just destroys them before his E even procs.

literally getting one comboed by a 1 item yone early game is silly. his damage is too high",1609565571

leagueoflegends,2021,1,"Hey Guys,

Personally, I don't really like Kog'Maw's passive. Here's a replacement I thought of (his old passive would be removed).

**Passive:**

1. Each of Kog'Maw's AOE abilities and auto attacks applies a stack to all champions hit. Each of Kog'Maw's single-target abilities applies two stacks to all champions hit. Each target can have up to 4 stacks.
2. *(Hidden)* Continuing to auto attack or use abilities on the target will prolong the duration of the 4 stack by 1 second.
3. Kog'maw takes 4-8% (scaling on level) reduced damage from the bearer of each stack, up to a maximum of 16-32%. The stacks will last for 3 seconds. 
4. Once a target reaches 4 stacks for the first time in (10-5 seconds, scaling based on level, affected by CD reduction), the target takes a moderate amount of true damage over 5 seconds.

I'm just trying to make him do a tiny bit more damage while being slightly more tanky, but I don't know how good this would be.

Besides his play rate at pro play is still very high as the only tank in the top lane being picked, that alone says enough. He just deals way too much dmg for a tank.

His Q has an AD ratio of 110% (TAD) +120 base dmg.

And his W deals 16% of a target's max HP on a 10 second cooldown at max rank. Add Ability Haste to that which is in his core build, and it's on roughly a 6 second cooldown. 16% a target's max HP on a 6 second cooldown while building FULL TANK, and this isn't taking into consideration his other abilities that also deal tons of dmg.

Well it never really mattered to me since no matter what do I do I'm still bronze and therefore suck at the game. Like I actually can't comprehend being in the bottom 20 percent, not even average?

Others say its because  u play with friends

Most of the times I play with my other friend but together we have literally like a 20 percent win rate, losing the majority of the time, most of the times being our own fault, the game is sometimes actually damaging out friendship.

Sometimes it feels like the game is a burden, I'm a high school student with tons of schoolwork and activities to complete. Yet every time I have free time league is always on the top of my list.

leagueoflegends,2021,1,"Ok, so I'm fairly certain, like at least to me its been almost confirmed, that the next champion released to League is gonna be the Ruined King. At the very least, the only champion so far who's been teased and not released. The jungling skirmisher. I'd go into why but I wrote this idea before and its a lot of writing and I don't wanna add even more.

Anyway, I decided to write down an idea I had for his kit, based on him being a jungler, a skirmisher and some of the stuff surrounding him (BorK, the Shadow Isles, the Ruination, stuff like that). Note that I'm not experienced in coming up with these sorts of things so yeah

\-

Passive: Despair of the Ruined King

Cooldown: 30 seconds

Periodically, TRK’s third consecutive basic attack deals (+40% AP) **bonus** magic damage. If *Despair of the Ruined King* targets a champion or monster, it will also slow the target by 10% (+3% per 100 AP), and reduce their resistances by 10% for 3 seconds, healing by the amount of resistances reduced.

Note: If the third attack triggers Blade of the Ruined King’s Siphon, then the slows will stack and the movement speed will be increased. This won’t work on any other item though.

Q Ability: Cursed Decree

Cast Time: 0.5 seconds, Cost: 50/55/60/65/70 Mana, Cooldown: 12/11/10/9/8 seconds

TRK thrusts his sword forward, dealing (100% **total** AD) physical damage to all enemies hit. The sword will also deal (40% AP) **bonus** damage, apply on-hit effects to and stun for 0.5 seconds the first enemy hit. 

W Ability: Mist-Veiled Swipe

Cost: 40 mana, Cooldown: 8/7/6/5/4 seconds

TRK’s next basic attack cleaves an area in front of him, dealing 20/30/40/50/60 (+40% AP) **bonus** magic damage to the target and 40/50/60/70/80 (+60% AP) magic damage to any other enemy in range. If *Mist-Veiled Swipe* targets a monster, its cool down is reduced to 2 seconds. *Mist-Veiled Swipe* resets TRK’s basic attack timer and applies on-hit effects.

E Ability: Royal Shroud

Cast Time: 1 second, Cost: 75/80/85/90/95 mana, Cooldown: 20/18/16/14/12 seconds

TRK envelops himself in mist, reducing the damage he takes by (10%/15%/20%/25%/30%) and increasing his movement speed by (11%/16%/21%/26%/31%) for 6 seconds. TRK’s next ability or basic attack during *Royal Shroud* will deal (30% AP) **bonus** magic damage but end the effect early.

*Royal Shroud* can be recast during its effect.

**Recast:** RTK will dash to the target location, becoming temporarily unstoppable until the dash has finished.

Ultimate: Ruination

Cast Time: 1 second, Cost: 100 mana, Cooldown: 160/140/120 seconds

TRK smashes his sword into the ground, dealing 100/200/300 (+80% AP) magic damage to all enemies around him and 50/100/150 (+50% **bonus** AD) **bonus** physical damage at the epicentre.

For the next 10 seconds, the mist will form in the damaging area, dealing 20/35/40 (+15% AP) magic damage per second to all enemies hit and healing him for the same amount, reduced by 90% against minions and monsters. If TRK scores a takedown during *Ruination*, he will gain 10% bonus damage to his basic attacks and abilities, increasing with each take down for up to 50% for 5 takedowns.",1609590178

leagueoflegends,2021,1,"Quick intro: I would like to thank everybody who has taken the time to give feedback on my rework posts (and those who will in the future). Somehow, I've managed to reach my ^(thirtieth)  kit iteration, and the thoughtful responses I've received helped me hit that milestone. 

I have made a [very detailed FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/user/HardstuckPlasticV/comments/j9wrhu/ryze_rework_faqs/). It's got a lot of important context that I've cut out so that this post is digestible. Take a look if you have any questions, there's a decent chance it's already addressed there. Now, onto the kit: 

&amp;#x200B;

\---------------------------

**TLDR:** Basic ability mana scalings are removed and replaced with non-damage scalings. Ryze has a new passive, The Scroll, which stores damage to be converted into shields. The rune charge system is removed, but Q resets remain. EW now slows, and EWQ roots. Autospread is removed and WE spreads flux. W can refund mana when it kills a minion. Realm Warp is removed and replaced with a new Desperate Power ultimate.

&amp;#x200B;

\----------------------------------

# Mana Scalings Changes

&amp;#x200B;

\- RUNIC RESHUFFLING: Existing basic ability mana scalings and Arcane Mastery are removed.

&amp;#x200B;

\-------------------

# Passive: The Scroll

&amp;#x200B;

\- MAGIC BATTERY: Ryze stores 30% of pre-mitigation damage from enemy Champions in The Scroll, up to \[200-700 + 20% bonus mana\]. Only damage to Ryze's health counts, not shields.

&amp;#x200B;

Overload casts drain \[40-140 + 4% bonus mana\] if available to give a 2-second decaying shield for the same amount.

&amp;#x200B;

Consecutive Overloads (less than 2 seconds apart) remove &amp; refresh this shield, but only for half value (the drain is not halved).

&amp;#x200B;

Stored damage decays while out of combat with champions (full -&gt; zero in 30 seconds).

&amp;#x200B;

[5 bars \(5 shields\) is the maximum that can be stored. My FAQ \(linked at the bottom\) has a more in-depth explanation of my reasoning behind this mechanic. I think it's better structured to create openings for opponents \(especially in lane trading\) and work more intuitively.](https://preview.redd.it/n0rj6uk9xw861.png?width=1199&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=421c0744dbad9fe2d31288ad238f43ab99a5cab5)

&amp;#x200B;

\------------------

# Q: Overload

&amp;#x200B;

\- RUNIC DISCHARGE: Rune charge system is removed. Cooldown resets remain.

&amp;#x200B;

\- OVERLOADED: Damage increased to \[80/110/140/170/200 + 55% AP\]. Ult-scaling bonuses are removed.

&amp;#x200B;

\------------------

# W: Unstable Flux / Prison Flux

&amp;#x200B;

\- Renamed to ""Unstable Flux"". It still slows by 35%, and the damage is dealt as a DoT.

&amp;#x200B;

\- MACHINE GUN: Cooldown reduced by 2 (11/10/9/8/7).

&amp;#x200B;

\- MINION SLAYER: If Unstable Flux kills a minion, \[mana cost + 60-160 mana\] is restored. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

[Skilled players should be able to punish this more effectively by abusing the trade-offs from a \\""W investment\\"". At the same time, the skill gap from proper mana management should decrease, helping to make Ryze more approachable \(a common rework goal\). The reduced mana reliance should help open up new build paths and laning strategies. The mana restoration is WIP, let me know what you think about that number \(I'm mostly worried about the early lane\). ](https://preview.redd.it/wh86wv0ezw861.png?width=572&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=08cdb6bb1c2e101f13371c7866ec4c7d7f6b42c7)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\- SPELL SPLIT: When Unstable Flux is cast on Spell Flux (EW), it splits to create ""Prison Flux"" and slows by 35%. Overload hitting Prison Flux (EWQ) roots the target for 1.5 seconds.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

[My FAQ has some context, as well as responses for multiple common arguments. Overall, the intent is to reduce reliability. This adds vulnerabilities and limits CC setups that are disproportionately valuable for coordinated teams. I think there are also clarity improvements; the tradeoffs provide obvious weaknesses to play around, and the design standardizes \\""enemy-facing\\"" combos loading their effects onto Q hits \(IMO this is also a more satisfying root structure\).](https://preview.redd.it/1josdjoqxw861.png?width=1140&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=aa677dfe849516f473ca2fa2c175a77443bdb6d6)

&amp;#x200B;

\----------------------

# E: Spell Flux

&amp;#x200B;

\- LIKE BUTTER: Spell Flux spreads when cast on Unstable Flux (WE). This consumes W, removing the slow.

&amp;#x200B;

\- MACHINE-GUN: Cooldown reduced by 0.25 (3/2.75/2.5/2.25/2).

&amp;#x200B;

\- FLUX THEM UP: Spell Flux deals \[35/45/55/65/75 + 20% AP\] damage (including spreads). This damage is dealt again when Overload consumes Spell Flux. The consumption ratio increases to 40% at 200 AP and 60% at 300 AP (see FAQ section 8). 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

[This changes the W combo trade-offs to include waveclear and teamfight AoE. Ryze can no longer waveclear while conserving his root; he must \\""expose\\"" himself to push quickly or maximize teamfight damage. This should help limit his push priority, especially when skilled opponents recognize and punish these windows. I tried to find a replacement combo for EEQ, but I felt like I was overcomplicating things for no benefit. This mechanic \(specifically, the flux consumption damage\) is a useful lever to help balance glass cannon builds separately.](https://preview.redd.it/7sea4b0vxw861.png?width=1208&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=050c998d0719581d084cd6119f369fb3c426aade)

&amp;#x200B;

\---------------------

# R: Desperate Power

&amp;#x200B;

\- LET'S (NOT) GO: Realm Warp removed.

&amp;#x200B;

\---

**PASSIVE**

&amp;#x200B;

\- GET OVER HERE: Ryze gains \[20% + 2% bonus mana, capped at 40%\] movespeed for 3 seconds towards visible enemy champions that damage him from outside Overload's range. This damage is stored in The Scroll with 100% efficiency.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

[I think that this Ryze \(in terms of his \\""threat profile\\""\) is like a juggernaut. He doesn't have good tools to take the initiative and engage fights, but he's extremely dangerous to face in the middle of combat with his high durability and consistent damage. This mechanic helps Ryze enter those fights once opponents initiate. I expect that this will be quite useful in lane against artillery mages, and it should also help vs. long-ranged backline threats in teamfights. Since I've added many weaknesses in the kit, I feel like there's enough room in the power budget to give Ryze this boost and help him function more effectively. In my FAQ, I explain why I think this is healthier than a \\""generic\\"" speed boost for the kit.](https://preview.redd.it/6jc553n4yw861.png?width=931&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2248491955ff5b71fda21c38138aeccd4cad3a76)

&amp;#x200B;

\---

**ACTIVE**

&amp;#x200B;

\- This has a (150/120/90) second cooldown and a (6/9/12) second duration.

&amp;#x200B;

\- KEEP YOUR DISTANCE: Enemies in melee range (&lt;250) lose up to 20/25/30% magic resistance over 2 seconds.

&amp;#x200B;

\- THIS ENDS BADLY: The ultimate passive speed boost is applied at half strength to attacks outside 250 range. Charge efficiency is not increased. 

&amp;#x200B;

[Enjoy my editing masterpiece. I've been struggling with this part of the kit. I want mechanics that \\""feel powerful\\"", but the base kit should have enough power \(especially with the shielding\) that I want to be very conservative with the ult. The MR reduction is VFX-dependent, but it shouldn't be too difficult to make it satisfying. Movement speed is also a very \\""strong-feeling\\"" buff. The two degrees of speed may seem a bit overcomplicated, but it really just boils down to Ryze running at people that attack him. If they're far away, he runs faster. If they're close, he runs slower. I've been experimenting with a lot of mechanics, so let me know if you think there's a better alternative to fit my goal. ](https://preview.redd.it/apkne14dyw861.png?width=1677&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=db179e03c91cfc12842427c1592c6dff2aef0207)

&amp;#x200B;

\- PROTECT THE SCROLL: If Ryze takes fatal damage, he spends half of his Scroll charge to regain 50% of his health and remain active. There is a 1.5-second post-death animation. Ryze dies if his HP hits zero or after (5/6/7) seconds.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

[I've put my explanation for this mechanic in the FAQ. You might find it strange and\/or \\""wrong\\"" at first, but I think that there is a good basis in Ryze's lore. Overall, I think this serves its purpose as a mechanic that feels impactful without affecting the power budget too much \(at least, not for players that respect it and properly shut Ryze down\). Ryze will keep his ultimate buffs during this time.](https://preview.redd.it/x5gigg753x861.png?width=1536&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=df051ca7634dbf25df80525d1ee4caa24deafeaf)

&amp;#x200B;

\- OUT OF JUICE: Ryze cannot use The Scroll for 6 seconds when the ult finishes. Any remaining charge dissipates.

leagueoflegends,2021,1,"So this is probably asked a billion times already but can't find it myself. I'm playing Wild Rift (have played League a few years ago but just got back into it).

Played Master Yi for the first time and my match stats were 12-1-2, 5-0-1, 17-4-4.

Started learning Akali after getting slammed in lane to better understand her and I got: 5-7-4, 4-5-2, 4-6-1.

Either I was playing in very amateur games or it seems Master Yi is the easiest champion in the world as it's essentially a Q teleport and you've got a kill if they're alone. 

With Akali it feels much more difficult and that it'll take me hundreds of games to get to similar stats as I've had for Yi in my very first games playing him.

I read that Akali has a large skill ceiling but are we really saying that Yi cannot be played to be as useful in high-end competitive play? 

Feeling like learning and losing with Akali for hundreds of games is a waste of time if I can just be effective from my first game with Yi and feeling like I wish they'd make Yi a little more difficult to play",1609597877

leagueoflegends,2021,1,"The idea is to increase the effective mmr of people who are in a premade to account for the fact that they will be coordinated and therefor getting more value from their abilities (which is effectively indistinguishable from having a higher mmr). This realization is what has driven the following adjustment.

Premade group member's mmr= solo queue mmr + ß\_N(group size dependant) + ß\_M(exists only if there are other premades in the group like 2+2+1 or 2+3)

where ß= C(N\^2)/5 +1 and N= the number of people in the premade and C is an arbitrary constant.

These are the values of ß for each premade size:

ß\_2 = C(1,8)

ß\_3 = C(2,8)

ß\_4 = C(4,2)

ß\_5 = C(6)

This means that ß grows quasi-lineally with premade size:

ß\_3/ß\_2 = 1,5555

ß\_4/ß\_3 = 1,5

ß\_5/ß\_4 = 1,42

These are the values of the 5 man premade compared to the others:

ß\_5/ß\_2 = 3,33333

ß\_5/ß\_3 = 2,14

ß\_5/ß\_4 = 1,42

In the case of mixed premades such as 2+2+1 and 3+2, where M= the size of the other premade in the group, the values for groups with more than one premade are like this:

2+2+1= ß\_2 + ß\_2 = C(3,6)

3+2= ß\_3 + ß\_2 = C(4,6)

The value of the 5man premade compared to the values of the combined premades:

ß\_5/(2+2+1) = 1,66666

ß\_5/(3+2) = 1,3

The value of a 4 man premade compared with combined premades:

ß\_4/(2+2+1) = 1,1666666

ß\_4/(3+2) = 0,913  =&gt; (3+2)/ß\_4 = 1,095

The value of a 3 man premade compared with combined premades:

ß\_3/(2+2+1) = 0,77777  =&gt; (2+2+1)/ß\_3 = 1,28

ß\_3/(3+2) = 0,6 =&gt; (3+2)/ß\_3 = 1,666666

The value of a 2 man premade compared with combined premades:

ß\_2/(2+2+1) = 0,5  =&gt; (2+2+1)/ß\_2 = 2

ß\_2/(3+2) = 0,39  =&gt; (3+2)/ß\_2 = 2,56

The comparison between the values of both combined premades:

(3+2)/(2+2+1) = 1,277777

Commentary:

This is just a first approximation to get the perfect equation. To advance this further i would need to get the winrates of all premade sizes vs all premade sizes and so i would adjust the ratios between the values--if needed--and i would be able to get the value of the constant C for the game of LOL. This is to say that this formula can be used to adjust the mmr inside of any 5v5 game and C is specific to each game and, probably, depends on time in some measure (under the assumption that the playerbase's average experience vs premades increases with time).

The constant C must be finely tuned with the help of said statistics so that the win rates for all matchups (i.e. 5man vs full solo queue or 3+2 vs duo queue or any other matchup) are as close to 50% as possible.

After adjusting the players' mmr using the here described method, one is to apply to it the common Glicko RD (rating deviation) treatment and you have then the tools to make balanced matches which result in less player frustration even with premades.

All the ratios between all values have been calculated based only on player perception of what is stronger than what and has no statistical foundation whatsoever. It would be fantastic to get the statistics to be able to make this equation exactly but, even with the inexactitude caused by the lack thereof, the incorporation of this adjustment to the current Glicko mmr system represents an upgrade in match making exactitude for any 5v5 game.",1609598689

Except Akshan. I couldn't find an art that would fit a card for him. My play group plays the commander format so I designed these cards with that in mind exclusively. Wanted to share since I'm pretty proud of my work so far! Let me know what you guys think :)

leagueoflegends,2022,1,"As the title suggests a fun little idea I had to make the rift a bit more interesting and impactful would be to deny vision on allies that enter a chem zone. So it'd be similar to how Morde or Nocturne currently work where hp and ult wouldn't update until AFTER they die, they leave the zone or you enter the same zone as them.  While tactically it wouldn't benefit you it would add an interesting dynamic to face checking the fog particularly for baron or Drake fights. Sending the tank ahead god knows if the enemy just 5 stacked him or if he's just caught a half hp kog maw out of position, or if your adc rotating mid stopped to do raptors or is kiting a sejuani or getting one shot by zed. It may be annoying but I think it'd be cooler than how it is now and make the map generally more interesting with more interactions. Granted certain strats or champs like fiddles or assassin's or 5 stacking gets more powerful but then again that might work inversely too.

Now, your gut reaction is probably like ""What the fuck are you talking about? BRAUM?""  


Yeah, Braum. The mustached shield man of no shirt. I am of the believe that no other melee champion can beat Braum 1 v 1 in top lane if he has Doran Blade + LT + Ignite  


His passive is a stun after 4 hits, which means not only do you get interrupted, but during that time you're stunned, his LT is getting stacked up. And then to further synergize with LT, all his autos after stunning you, do on hit magic damage for a short period of time.  


Basically, he's an absolute monster at level 1. The likes that I don't think even Darius can fight. What melee champion can beat Braum at level 1? Can Jax squeeze it out with an E start?",1641003396
leagueoflegends,2022,1,"I been having this extremely frustrating issue for about a week now. I would load into a match or start a game of Teamfight Tactics and every minute or so everything would freeze in place or become unresponsive. I would get the reconnecting message and about a second later I reconnect and I can play again. This happens every single minute.

I played other online games and my connection to them is just fine, it is only when I play League of Legends or Teamfight Tactics.
Best information I can give is that I go between a hotspot on my phone and using pdanet. Here is what I done to try and fix this.

-Turn my mobile data off and back on again -Restart my phone -Restart my computer -Turn on Airplane mode and back off again -Turn my hotspot off and on again

leagueoflegends,2022,1,"Let's just say the friends I play with are not very experienced in league. They probably have an MMR somewhere in bronze but improving rapidly. We typically only play ARAM or the rotational game modes if available. When I play solo, everything is fine. I typically get matched with people my skill level and maybe a single smurf on the other team which is not a big deal. The game goes well, and it's enjoyable for the most part. I've won 16/20 games when playing solo. 

But man, when I play with my friends, it's smurf city and I have no idea why every game is a premade of smurfs. Last 6 games we've played were so low quality. The other team are all playing on iron/bronze 4 accounts and guess what, my friends and filler teammates are all actually bronze and the games are so incredibly unfun. I understand smurfing is hard to tackle, but my friends don't want to play anymore and when you call out the smurfs, they don't give a damn that they're ruining new/casual players experiences. 

My friends and I just want to enjoy this gamemode, as they like it over ARAM, but we're just stuck playing aram forever at this point because we don't typically get smurfs. The reason I'm posting this is because we just played and incredibly frustrating game against smurf premades, and when confronted, they told us to ""play against bots"" while they're the ones indifferent about making this game toxic for us. I know this game mode isn't supposed to be serious, but it's also supposed to be FUN, and fun doesn't exist, just us realizing it's going to be another 15 minute game over and over again. I don't think riot cares too much about improving matchmaking for ultimate spellbook, but I can't imagine the experience for casual/row rank players this is ruining. 

Should Riot do anything about this? The game mode does attract casual players, but it very quickly deters them due to horrible matchmaking and low quality games.",1641003576

leagueoflegends,2022,1,"You've all seen plenty of games with bots, because Riot can't seem to figure out that registration is one of the best tools to combat botted accounts. But when those bots start ruining ranked games, we have no recourse. Sure, MAYBE the account will get banned because other players on your team will think you're just being toxic (even when the bot account has a history of 10-20 deaths in every game and is heavily negative on the losing side of games) and report you instead, but that doesn't solve the issue at hand: You just lost your LP. Maybe worse, you're on a slump because you get matched against some smurf or an Irelia main who stomps your game, or an invincible Tahm Kench, etc, and now you just got demoted because you had a bot on your team that just walked at the enemy team.  


Remake needs to be something that triggers FAR more often, and there needs to be a means to negate losses from these bot accounts. There needs to be bigger opportunities beyond just someone having connection issues. A remake should trigger if a player is severely negative to the point of unreasonable (like, for example, one death every minute) and something beyond ""having a bad game"" or ""skill gap"" judgment. You can easily tell when an AI can't make up a decision and it starts dancing back and forth unable to process. Likewise when someone does not respond to any prompting, pings, etc, it's very likely that they are an even lower tier of bot that doesn't have reactive scripts in it's subroutine.",1641004930

leagueoflegends,2022,1,"I've been a LoL player for 8 years now and never get bored playing a game with only 2 maps. But recently, exactly a few months back, I felt like I couldn't spend 30 minutes sitting at my computer and playing Summoner's Rift anymore, I don't know if it was because the youthful enthusiasm had faded after almost a decade or not. I still play LoL every day though, but play ARAM more than before and continuously. I like ARAM because of its constant teamfights, and the fast pace of the game without having to worry about a rift herald knocking out 2 turrets in side lane, or someone getting ganked too much to be left behind in the game.

&amp;#x200B;

I have played a number of other Esport Competitive titles, and CSGO is the game I use as an example. Previously, to win a CSGO match, you needed to reach the 16th victory, but if the opposing team plays on par with your team, the match will last up to nearly 1 hour. Valve could have realized this and launched a shorter game mode, which is the 8th win

&amp;#x200B;

There are actually some modes in League that help speed up the game, like URF or Ultimate Spell Book, but what I mean by this is I want a game mode like normal Summoner's Rift, but push pacing grow a bit faster, as the player will get experience over time like in ARAM, gold grows faster, campsites respawn faster,...",1641009156

leagueoflegends,2022,1,"Hello, I spent hours in testing and calculating in practice tool, and I can say for sure that Shadowflame is NOT giving the Magic pen it is supposed to give. 

The description in game says ""max benefit when the target has 1000 or less health""

The description from wiki says basically the same but more detailed :   
Formula: 10 + 1 for every -150 target's current health starting from 2500 target's current health and capped at 1000 target's current health.  
Source : [https://leagueoflegends.fandom.com/wiki/Shadowflame?so=search](https://leagueoflegends.fandom.com/wiki/Shadowflame?so=search) (hover the passive description on the right of the page to get the formula)

**Unless it is a bug specific to the practice tool, which I highly doubt, Shadowflame is granting 1.6 to 2.9 less magic pen than intended/stated in the tooltip**. It's not a gamebreaking bug, but nobody seem to be aware of that and this bug persists at least since Shadowflame went live (probably was already on PBE but I did not test there)

I tried on different champions and I never saw Shadowflame working as intended. The easiest way to test is to remove any damaging rune that could interfere, then start a practice tool.  
Buy only shadowflame, put a target dummy with minimum health (1000) and 20 MR.   
Attack the target dummy with a simple spell that does a single instance of damage like annie Q.  
Note the result, then sell Shadowflame, and buy instead sorcerer shoes + needlessly large wand + blasting wand to have the same AP than shadowflame.  
Attack again the target dummy with that new build using the same spell like above and note the result.  
In both situations you have 100 AP so your base damage in the same, only Mpen changes with the 2 builds. Since target has 1000 hp or less, shadowflame is supposed to grant 20 Mpen against that target, and pre mitigation damage should be equal to post mitigation damage (you have 20 mpen and target has 20MR, but the values are always lower than the predictions because in that case, for some reason in that situation Shadowflame gives 17.1 Mpen instead of 20.  
Additonally, the sorcerer shoes 100 ap build always do slightly more damage than Shadowflame only.  
But you are supposed to benefit from 2 additional magic pen against 1000 HP targets when you shadowflame instead of sorc shoes.  
After making the math, I could find out that Shadowflame grants 17.1 Magic Pen exactly on targets with 1000 current health or less. I tried to reduce target below 1000 current health to try but it always give the same results than 1000 hp target, so it does not scale below 1000 current health as stated in the tooltip. Also it grants 8.4 magic pen instead of the intended 10 on targets with 2500 current health or above, and it doesn't decrease further as the health of target increase.

The general formula to calculate post mitigation damage is :   
Post mitigation damage = base damage\*100/(100+armor)  
It is the same formula for magic resist and ability haste  
Source : [https://leagueoflegends.fandom.com/wiki/Armor?so=search](https://leagueoflegends.fandom.com/wiki/Armor?so=search)  
Graph for ability haste into cdr or armor/mr into damage reduction : [https://www.desmos.com/calculator/atkt8mr6qf?lang=fr](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/atkt8mr6qf?lang=fr)

So what I did next is picking Annie because her Q is simple for tests, I removed any rune that give any offensive benefit to not interfere with the test, I went for Shadowflame/Rabaddon/Lost chapter/Spellthief edge, which granted me exactly 374 AP so my Q does exactly 500 base damage at rank 5.

Then I put a target dummy with 20 mr and I tested my Q damage on it for each HP value possible.  
I tested for 888, 1000, 1100, 1200, 1300, 1400, 1500, 1600, 1700, 1800, 1900, 2000, 2100, 2200, 2300, 2400, 2500, 2600 hp  
(For the 888, it's 2 auto before Qing at Annie level 9, was just to make sure the magic pen doesn't increase further if target goes below 1000 current health)

Here you can see all my data in a google sheet screenshot :  [https://ibb.co/8b22D3Q](https://ibb.co/8b22D3Q)  
You can easily reproduce my results step by step with all the infos I gave.  
For the **Expected Mpen** column, I am just following the wiki chart (but from my testing, the formula is linear and not working per 150 health threshold as stated in the wiki - but it's really a detail, whatever.  
For the **Calculated Mpen**, the formula is : MR-(-100\*Post mitigation damage+100\*500)/Post mitigation damage  
For the **Expected dom,** the formula is just 500\*100/(100+MR - Expected Mpen)  
The **Damage done** is just the post mitigation damage displayed on my screen at the moment my spell hit

The column about the damage done with sorcerer shoes instead of Shadowflame is meant to confirm there is no error in formula or math, in that column every observed result match with the expected result. (Specifically, 500 base damage on a 20 mr target when you have 18 magic pen turns into 490.2 post mitigation damage which is what the formula predicted. 500\*100/(100+2) = 490.19

This is by the way what should happen with Shadowflame on the 1300 and 1400 current health target but the damage done is 478 and 475 instead of 490.19 because the Mpen granted by Shadowflame is 15.4 and 14.7 instead of 18 and 18.

Additionally, I did not test against shield but I assume I would get the same values than I get while attacking a 1000 hp target or below.   
Also for those who wondered, it works as usual Magic pen for the void staff interaction (and similar effects like morde E passive), the % magic pen is applied BEFORE the flat magic pen, just like sorcerer shoes.

**TLDR** : **Unless it is a bug specific to the practice tool, which I highly doubt, Shadowflame is granting 1.6 to 2.9 less magic pen than intended/stated in the tooltip, depending on enemy current health**

It's obviously not intended. And it's lasting for very long already. Any thoughts? I'm going to contact support to ask and see what they answer. If you think I am missing something, feel free to correct, but I really triple checked all the informations I gave there!",1641014901

leagueoflegends,2022,1,"It's not about matchups, it's not about ""counterpicking"" or any of that shit... assuming there isn't a monumental difference in skill... the better champ always wins. 

Like, pick any AD assassin, and have someone else pick Zoe. It doesn't matter if that person has 5M mastery on Zoe and has been no lifing the champ since her release... there's just nothing that Zoe can do about some braindead one shot machine clicking on her with their entirely targeted kit -- even if she lands her abilities, there's 20 runes and items to save the assassin's ass... and all Zoe's got is Zhonya's, which really just delays her death for a second under normal circumstances.

Then look at top lane. Pick any tank, versus any bruiser. There is quite literally nothing the tank can do to that bruiser, to the extent they can't even win or even hold their lane without jungler intervention.

Look at support. Unless you have hard engage or you're a mage pretending to be a support... you have no agency at all. You just have to hope someone on your team is less than braindead, or you lose automatically.

I think it would be of benefit if under 20s are grouped together, above 30s grouped together etc...I see no actual downside to it except a smallish increase in queue times, which for me does not matter, would rather have like-minded teammates and wait for 5 mins, then have completely not like-minded teammates and wait for 2 mins...

Kids would play with kids, be super competitive, aim for win, be toxic if losing and so on

Meanwhile over 30s would focus mostly on troll champs or builds, drink beer, crack stupid jokes and sur at 15 while winning because why not, its fun and stupid

Not saying all would, and for sure it would be better to differentiate by for ex. a survey or game-mode, because currently the fun people are in ARAM and toxic in Rift, which is a shame since I prefer rift map, but would prefer being with fun people, but survey and stuff takes time, this can be turned on a jiffy...

leagueoflegends,2022,1,"When playing class based team games (league/overwatch) the most common recommendation is to find a main. With this including a main role-champ/pool, it’s sounds like a really good idea because you can become very knowledgeable in your champ’s matchups and quirks, however, I can’t bring myself to pick. 

It doesn’t feel like this problem comes up few to the lack of characters, but rather when playing a champ I find myself feeling torn when I loose a game. Every character has pros and cons to keep the game balanced, but either an enemy has a champ that looks better/cooler to play or I feel like my champ lacks something. I understand that the champ is like a tool that is wielded to the player and with enough time and practice, you can make even the bad champs work.

leagueoflegends,2022,1,"If the verbal toxicity bot is able to detect toxic behaviour and this behaviour is never allowed; why is this system not made to screen what people type and simply produce blank fields as output from offensive input. Some words like the N word are homophobic slurs are never allowed why can a person still produce them (there is even an offensive language filter so it's not like the technology of toxicity bot can't be matched with live chat).  


So if starting today Riot would decide that (the system also recognizes context to some degree; as we know by the automated feedback produced by the bot):  
Angry person: I hope you die dirty N word  
Output: I hope \*cuddles my friend\*

OR

Output: I hope (followed by nothing)

OR

Output: warning text: if you feel heated take a small break (or something similar: only visible to you and nothing being posted in chat; seems like the best solution to me)  


To me implementing this seems so logical (why is it even possible to say N word or homophobic slurs). The part that makes me wonder if I am paranoid is the answer I keep gravitating towards when asking myself this question:  
This is not being implemented because Riot knows toxicity in all it's forms is perceived as a major (probaby the biggest problem) in league. But unlike verbal toxicity the other forms of toxic behaviour are extremely difficult to punish with an automated system without a high risk of false positives (and would probably require trained personel actively monitoring/watching live games which would cost a ton of money and not be feasible).   


We all know that perception/media is everything and he whom loses control of the perception risks major damage to it's brand. If riot would have the option to overnight make verbal abuse a thing of the past would this be in their best interest (in my opinion they have this power); my answer is NO! They would be left with the problem the majority of people are actually discontent about (the griefing, the trolling/running it down etc.).   
But unlike verbal abuse it is very hard to produce feedback for consumers to see they are addressing something in regards to these problems; so less instant feedback reports, less impressive stats that problems are being adressed (we punished X people which is a higher percentage/number than last year guys so we are cleaning the streets! type of messages). Which would make them lose the grip on how they are perceived in regard to this subject; leading to possible extreme damage to their brand.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: Riot could very easily eradicate the vast majority of toxicity they are PUNISHING for. However, because they are unable to actually address the toxicity they are not able to punish, they need to keep the category that they are able to address ""alive"" to please the public eye.

leagueoflegends,2022,1,"The way this would work is that you need 3 players from 1 team and 4 from the other to vote someone and mark them as a ""troll player"". This will do absolutely nothing in-game, the game will keep playing as normal until a team wins and then the following will happen :

- In case the enemy team wins (we are gonna use this term to talk about the team without the troll player), the team that has the troll will lose no LP or get a loss mitigation like when someone goes afk. The enemy team gets normal LP gain.

- In case the team with the troll wins, the troll player will get no lps.

In both situations the player marked as troll will be queue locked from ranked for 1 day and the system will be able to analyze the game to better detect this sort of behaviour in a future. Consecutive queue lock outs will increase the lock out time and will result in an investigation to see if this player deserves to be banned.

With this system the enemy team gets no beneffit at all for voting the troll player, the only reason would be to punish someone that is indeed ruinning games, and since you need the majority of both teams to vote this won't be abusable by premades or by a a losing team to mitigate LP gains

Obviously this is only a prototype and will need adjustments but I think it will be a way to get rid of the most obvious soft inters.",1641045612

Is the AD from IE just THAT important/helpful for Lethality Xayah, even though she literally has no other crit item before it?

Help me lol, I'm really dumb. I was always told that you shouldn't get IE if you don't have 60% crit chance. Have I just been lied to all this time? Or am I just misunderstanding how this information is being displayed? Are those 'Fourth item options' being pulled from ALL Xayah games or specifically just games where she goes Eclipse + Manamune?

leagueoflegends,2022,1,"Let's discuss top lane and why the role is good and why it's bad and things that just feel plain terrible.

My favorite thing is that top lane is the ultimate 1v1 me bro type of lane where you interact with the rest of the map less than any other role.

Easily the number one hands down biggest issue of top lane this season is lethal tempo, you know the rune that let's Yone, Trundle, Irelia, Jax, Tryndamere and more run you down from level 1 unless you pick one of their hard counters, and even then some traditional hard counters no longer beat them.  Most of these champs were already considered toxic to play against.  The fact that a champ like Yone who's meant to be weak early can survive and even hard win in top lane vs most matchups is a joke in itself.  The fact you can get about 2000 gold worth of stats at level 1 without a CD to play around is just bonkers and I can't believe anyone thought this was a good idea.  Conqueror only gives about 500 gold worth of stats and the duration lasts less time and falls off instantly.

The other issue that's become more and more of a problem is the amount of times when the 1v1 skill of the top laners matters less because jungle is having too large of an impact.  Hard outplaying your opponent but the enemy jungler decides to camp your lane congrats unless your jungler does the same you don't get to play the game.

While the lane is meant to be a 1v1 type island, winning your island should bring benefits to your team, the TP change on the PBE feels terrible.  Hard winning your lane and want to sacrifice a wave to help your team win that important dragon fight, well now you can't.  TP allowed top lane to be the ultimate 1v1 island while still mattering.  Want to help your feeding bot lane TP, it feels bad to be winning your island but your bot lane is 0-10 and the enemy team got all the drakes because of it, at least with teleport you get some sort of say, after the TP change top feels like a worthless role.

Last the fact that a champ like Akshan or Vayne is playable as a top laner is just pure aids Vayne is broken thanks to lethal tempo and Akshan is just a terrible design that I really wish never made it into league.  Stealth reveive insane mobility it's like they took every mechanic people hate and put it all on one champ.",1641050484

leagueoflegends,2022,1,"So I play as an ADC at the moment, I always hated Yasuo since release (damn you CertainlyT).  
But nowadays we have lots of people who know how to play him well, it's not 2014 anymore, Shieldbow gave him lots of survivability, Lethal Tempo and Lifesteal give him lots of power and little ways to counterplay.  


Now the most obnoxious non-ultimate spell in the game, in my opinion, is Wind Wall. Countering almost every ranged champion with 0 interactions, it's cooldown may be long, but still, costs 0 mana and if used well enough is basically a 4 second immune against certain champions. If you can't dash out of it's way, or if there's minions nearby, you'll be juggled, there's also the hitbox, stronger Yasuo Players know how to use it, the wall is thick enough that Yasuo can be on its center and not be hit by anything.

So, my proposal is that Yasuo is really tanky enough right now due to itemization, we don't need the Wind Wall to be thick anymore, it should just be thin, if you don't know and wanna test out, the wall is really extremely thick, hitting from the side of the wall will result in your shots getting deflected, and this interaction is really bullshit, let us hit from the side of the wind wall, make him move more if we're needing to move as well.",1641052967

leagueoflegends,2022,1,"First Strike is obviously a controversial rune because it literally gives gold just for hitting people. Which I guess is fine, the rune is pretty balanced on most champions. But good lord, this rune is so infuriatingly strong.

I want to start with who I think is the primary abuser of this rune: Gangplank. Most of the games I see Gangplank in, he tops the gold charts. And it's not even close. Just build Prowler's claw/Triforce and do some absolutely obscene damage that, would you know it, increases your gold even more so you can buy more items after!

&amp;#x200B;

[This is my Irelia. I have 13 kills and 291 cs.](https://preview.redd.it/7f0d0dg1k3981.png?width=226&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e9c7fdb44e2246db68c80729d81c5f1ccd80177e)

&amp;#x200B;

[This is the enemy Gangplank. 9 kills, 238 cs. ](https://preview.redd.it/nslp3775k3981.png?width=217&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=85dd9952a1b62ff9c489887658c0a9aae84db307)

The game was pretty close throughout. No team was winning by more than 4k gold until the enemy pulled away at the very end. Gangplank started off lane like 1/4, so he got a couple shutdowns. That's fine, I got a couple shutdowns too off of fed enemies. Based off these stats, I should have more gold than Gangplank. Even if he gets turrets (I think we had even turrets) our gold should be even at worst. Right?

&amp;#x200B;

[This is the gold graph at the end of the game. Gangplank got 3.5k more than me. This is, of course, down 4 kills and 50 cs. ](https://preview.redd.it/i4cub9n0l3981.png?width=289&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6d3b77073b0316ca5b8dbe95c7153aea994dff2f)

Here's another example:

&amp;#x200B;

[This is my Jax. Kind of a poor game, but still respectable 11 kills and 324 cs.](https://preview.redd.it/26ftcjkpl3981.png?width=227&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=43e776e8b39f026fb79c9cb15664d29f26a0ae0f)

&amp;#x200B;

[This is the enemy Gangplank. 373 cs, 15 kills. ](https://preview.redd.it/ikxpp2iul3981.png?width=226&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bb65dc1e8c197c51d2af97f4275b78751d3c8208)

In this game, the enemy was leading the entire game. So there were no objective bounties, no shutdowns, etc.

Obviously, the Gangplank got the better of me. So a decent gold lead would be fair. A couple thousand maybe, considering I was getting some shutdowns?

&amp;#x200B;

[This is the gold graph at the end of the game. A 4 kill and 50 cs deficit warrants a 6.5k gold lead? Since when? Also notable: the Vi had 19 kills and the Aphelios had 17 kills \(albeit worse cs numbers. But that doesn't cover 6k gold!\)](https://preview.redd.it/o4k2q8uhm3981.png?width=296&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2ca876992529c9e5ddf0359f6fa701d48520ebfb)

Obviously, two game examples doesn't tell the full story. Well, here are some other interesting statistics! On Lolalytics, Gangplank ranks #1 in highest gold income. 

&amp;#x200B;

[These are his exact stats. Patch 11.24, Plat+.](https://preview.redd.it/virrzrs2n3981.png?width=308&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a1f4abc68a1c0680b9f2bb972db1439317c21335)

Stats without context are meaningless. 

&amp;#x200B;

[These are Gangplank's stats on Patch 11.22, one patch before preseason \(and before the introduction of First Strike\).](https://preview.redd.it/8tb5gkh7n3981.png?width=312&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=959b17e7e8059c3769450affced38155d90001d1)

So Gangplank's gold income has increased by around 800 since the start of preseason. That, in my opinion, is absolutely nuts.

Let me note that Gangplank is a skill-intensive champion. So these Plat+ stats based on the average playerbase don't really do him justice. I'll just take Solarbacca, one of the more known Challenger Gangplank players.

&amp;#x200B;

[These are his Season 11 stats on Gangplank. Mostly in line with the average.](https://preview.redd.it/3oiilznap3981.png?width=530&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c62774586f24a2a5ca2ea946dcf0c23c320c8d81)

&amp;#x200B;

[These are his stats for the past 30 days. Note that his gold\/min has gone up an astonishing \(!!!\) 55 gold per minute.](https://preview.redd.it/2b0e74sfp3981.png?width=490&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=386de7b7d2e186900a55ce66a671d8e09d607642)

Let's take another player. 

[This is the rank 1 Gangplank on leagueofgraphs. Obviously he's not the absolute best, this is probably just a smurf. But we'll stick with these stats, which are from season 11.](https://preview.redd.it/fuw0yrxvp3981.png?width=496&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1dfeb58c0ccd86cbf0b93df927cfe8adaa5e2d14)

&amp;#x200B;

[These are his stats for the past 30 days. Note the gold\/min increased by \(!!!\) 58 gold.](https://preview.redd.it/qwglm831q3981.png?width=493&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6c0cdfabbc22d605bb92fda190702fe8b82834d3)

So this gold-earned discrepancy is even more extreme among otps. 

Maybe Gangplank is an outlier. Well, let's see.

&amp;#x200B;

[These are Jayce's stats on Patch 11.19, the World's patch. Remember, Jayce had a 55.4&amp;#37; presence at World's on this patch. ](https://preview.redd.it/vkl0o631o3981.png?width=302&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e0fd2bc7460f989e49b622be694285bb83fd9aa0)

&amp;#x200B;

[These are Jayce's stats on Patch 11.24. He has an even more egregious 1k gold increase.](https://preview.redd.it/4j56stk9o3981.png?width=308&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d7414a0976b9548785a728bf6e1b99b7397d1d84)

Just one more. Bear with me here.

&amp;#x200B;

[Viktor's stats on Patch 11.22. Mid-tier pick, not that good.](https://preview.redd.it/pbuotzdio3981.png?width=302&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cf5354e48147f64a81d9624e095dbe7693bcd79b)

&amp;#x200B;

[This is Viktor on Patch 11.24. S-tier pick \(not necessarily because of First Strike, but it certainly contributes\). His gold generation has gone up 600g.](https://preview.redd.it/x2xga6jmo3981.png?width=308&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d39a9542e56a390cd8a0decdfddd069b17c5240d)

I don't know if it's just me, but this rune just seems completely out of line. It is polarizing champ select, because certain champions can earn gold much, much faster. I'm not sure how we can even balance this rune (maybe delete it? lol) but champions earning 500-1000 gold on average just from this rune seems insane to me. I think we need to ask ourselves if we want this kind of cheese in the game. It's simply earning gold through brainless fighting, and at no risk for champions like Jayce or Viktor. I think we're in for a very rude awakening if this rune stays unchanged through preseason and pro play comes around. We'll see Bin and The Shy abusing Gangplank and Jayce with quite little counterplay. 

These stats speak for themselves. The average player benefits largely from this rune. The OTPs benefit largely from this rune. First Strike gives way, way too many resources in the midgame for very little damage tradeoff. And let's not forget that taking this rune allows you to go biscuits, boots, and cpot for more added sustain!

Please, save just a bit of my mental. Let's change this rune. We can make it a New Year's Resolution or something!

tl;dr: First strike is giving way too many resources and is too strong.",1641054510

leagueoflegends,2022,1,"So I love playing the game solo (high gold ranked) but man sometimes it’s nice to duo queue ranked or norms and be on comms.  Back when I was 18-20 I would just add people I had good synergy with, but after taking a long break and coming back to game at thirty I don’t necessarily want to end up on comms with some crazy teenager lmao.

leagueoflegends,2022,1,"I’ve been trying to work on my mechanics and go out of my comfort zone to pick up a mechanically intensive champion. So, I’ve gone from jungler to midlane Yasuo main. I didn’t do as much as I could have in a game and got flamed by my jungler at the end telling me “41% WR in 41 games don’t play Yasuo”. Now that does seem bad and I don’t have a lot of games on him yet but when I first picked up Yasuo I remember losing my first 11 games. So by him telling me this stat I actually felt good because that means in my last 30 games my WR was quite high! Whether this is just me looking on the bright side or proof of some improvement I thought it was funny that his flame lead me to a wholesome feel good moment.

Akshan and even Vex the supposed anti mobility champ are further examples of riot refusing to bring mobility creep under control.  There was a time when I looked forward to new champ releases, a time when they had reasonable and not overloaded kits with less tilting mechanics.  The new champ team needs to start considering how new champs feel to play against, if they did I don't think Akshan would have perma stealth or a revive passive, I don't think Viego would be able to go untargetable or have a free targeted  free cast on his ult, Vex ult wouldn't be a long range dash or a reset (anti mobility champ my ass), Samira just wouldn't exist the champ designer even mentioned they wanted to make something tilting to play against like what the actual fk how is this OK for a champ designer to think this way.  Champs from seasons 10 and 11 for the most part just make the game worse not better.  There are exceptions like Lillia Gwen and Rell that show they do know how to make less frustrating to play against champs.

leagueoflegends,2022,1,"""6% more damage against enemies with more hp than you"" is ridiculously niche, and unfun.

Adc's mow down bruisers much faster with it giving them 6% more damage against them for the majority of the fight against them. Assassins as well. This buff is also ridiculously overpowered on Tryndamere. It's almost impossible to win against a Trynd who get's 4 chemtech dragons. (24% damage buff during ult). 

This buff also is completely useless on any champions that are actually building health or have health in their kits such as sion, chogath, nasus, darius, garen, morde, etc.

**The base buff should be changed so it's valuable and worth getting for every champion.** Atm the only reason to get this dragon as a bruiser is ""so the other team doesn't get it"" which is really not the way a game should be designed",1641070045

But so many people (and this isn't a champion specific thing either, this isn't like a ""all yone players are ego players"", every group does this) just run around, not listening to pings or calls, going in 1v5 or just not going in at all, not taking objectives, not ganking certain lanes, rage splitting after being called out, holding losing games hostage, etc. It gets really tilting when a perfectly winnable game is just completely ruined because someone's fragile ego gets hurt and then they essentially run it down and force the game into a loss because of it. The video linked below with Tyler1 basically shows this concept in a nutshell. 

To sum it up, he is in a perfectly winnable game and then his J4 jungle and Zed midlaner get heated over basically nothing and the J4 just completely throws the game into a loss because the zed ""didn't say sorry""

The worst is when people play like garbage, and then get called out for playing like garbage, and then start crying and running it because they're ego just can't handle it. Just brings this whole game down every single time it happens and absolutely nothing is being done about it on Riot's side.

leagueoflegends,2022,1,"I didn't do a whole lot math wise or consider how busted or not busted this would be. This is purely for fun, and something that I'd consider fun on a marksman. If there is a subreddit for this, please link it as I have a few fun ideas that I'd also like to share. This champion is my idea, dm me if you're considering using it in any shape, form, or fashion.

Passive: Crag has top of the line chem-tech built into the suit, as such, he has increased capabilities over his fellow Zaunites. Fire fight: The more champion abilities and autos that Crag takes during an engagement, the more aggressive he feels he needs to become. Converting percentages of his auto attacks to true damage as he becomes more accurate

Q: BeaconCrag chooses a target and marks them, gaining move speed towards them as well as bonus range. Ability resets on takedown

W: BeatdownCrag does a spin attack with his non-dominant hand, stunning all in the range for ‘x’ time. If the target is marked with ‘Beacon’, the move speed becomes a general buff instead of just towards them.

E: Zaunite ElevatorPassive: Crag ignores minion unit collision while ability is down

Active: Crag leaps, using the first thing he hits as a jump post. If it’s a wall, the jump is doubled. If it’s a champion, he still chooses a direction; displacing the target away from said direction he goes. (Not unlike quinn, but with lucian dash range and camille secondary)

R: Chem-tech authorityToggle, costing X mana per x seconds, ramping like Kog/Kass ult

Crag pulls out a Piltover crystal enhanced rifle, with all the fits and trims a Zaunite could want. The weapon has increased range with ramping range against the champion he designates with his Beacon. This rifle is also magically weightless thanks to the gem, removing the need to stop to auto attack.

The mana cost resets on takedown

Crag uses a pistol as his main form of weaponized combat, though he has plenty of experience in unarmed combat. Relying on his custom weapon, he could fight his way through the lanes if he had to. The rifle he carries, folded in half, would look almost out of place if it didn’t have a litany of chem-tech adorning it. The shine that once held over this beautiful weapon, long gone. With how much of his gear is nothing more than cobbled together chem-gear, it’s all surprisingly well put together. There’re scuffs and scorches all over his gear, though metal still shows through it all, the weight seems to not be a concern to him. Magic stones, stolen straight from the pilty penthouses seem to run his suit and rifle. This is what gives him the edge now. He fought his way up to the top on scraps, now he’ll never forget his roots, and stay on top with his advantages

He has 550 base range

Beacon has his auto range +50/125/150/175/200 as the cast range, and extends his attack range to this extent against the marked character

His ultimate, when toggled, will also increase his attack range by 75/150/200. Mana cost will lower slightly, extending the duration he can use this ability by a semi-consistently usable margin",1641070562

leagueoflegends,2022,1," No matter what class of champions you prefer, I believe that we can all agree on one thing ; the item overhaul has completely defeated the purpose of most classes.   

I mean, you can take a look at AD assassins, they have invis. Take a look at Marksmen, they have a shield. Take a look at mages, they have more anti-burst options other than Zhonya’s. If you told me all this a few years ago, I would have told you that you’re crazy.    

All classes have an item to solve their weaknesses, so in return everything is broken. That’s why we all hate the item overhaul so much, and we’re not wrong. Looking back at it now, what went wrong?

What was Riot’s intention with the item overhaul anyway?  Riot claims that the goal of the item rework was to “broaden players’ strategic choices”.  Seems like a good idea in theory right?  

1 whole season has passed and I believe we can all agree that this did not really happen..? Apart from SOME marksmen’ having 3 very unique options, I think most champions have a standard mythic item for every game.

leagueoflegends,2022,1,"I think it's about time to rework Jax, and I have some ideas.

First, design wise, we should just change it completely. He looks like a trash bag on 2 legs. I think turn him into a human. Everyone love humans! Then, I think that his purple color scheme is really ugly. Make it yellow! With the mix of silver here and there. I think we don't have a lot of yellow champion in game, right? Then, turn his mask into goggles, but make them BIG. I want to see his beautiful lips, but I still want him to have multiple eyes, because that's cool. Then, take away his lamp and turn it into a sword. I know, but let's be honest, lamp is pretty stupid. A blade is much more fitting for the grandmaster that he is. Also, to emphasise the fantasy of being the grandmaster, add several blades on his legs too. He might not use them, but at least he looks threatening, right?

Now, for his passive, I think instead of gaining attack speed, he should just attack twice. Kind of like old ult passive, but without the bonus damage. However, I think that would make on-hit and crit builds even stronger on him!

For his Q, he should teleport and kinda do several slashes. His leap was always boring. But with this ability, he looks cool AND enemies can't do anything to him while he is slicing them up. Finally, make cooldown decrease on each crit hit and make the ability damage being able to crit too. Just to add more crit synergy, of course!

For his W, he should meditate and restore health, while gaining damage reduction and gaining passive stacks. His old W is super boring. And you can still reset auto attacks using this too! With this, he really feels like some kinda master of yi energy. We can call him Master Yi, or something like that haha!

For his E, he should enhance all his auto attacks to deal bonus damage. Yep, like old W, but multiple times! And to make him actually balanced, since he loses his stun, he should instead deal true damage over the duration. 

And for his ult, he should become more deadly instead of just being more tanky. Come on, Jax! You should be a threat, after all! Let him gain more movement speed, immunity to slows, and bonus attack speed to compensate for his old passive loss. Also, make his ult extend on takedowns, kinda like how he challenges enemies one by one and immediately rushes in another battle! 

Now, since his new kit and look are set, we should please all old Jax fans too. I know that many people dislike huge changes for their champs, like in case with Aatrox or even Volibear. So, to please everyone, we should just take an already existing champion named Master Yi and pretty much turn him into old Jax. But what if Master Yi mains complain about the loss of their champion, you say? Fear not! I can assure you that new Jax will play pretty similar to old Master Yi, so everyone can be pleased!",1641077149

Champion like Braum Taric and Rell are almost *perfect* against divers and ad threats yet are some of the least popular champs in the game.

Janna is the bane of every assassins existence, but is practically an afterthought nowadays despite high stats.

Why is it, when an assassin is drafted on the enemy team with high skirmishing or roam potential, is your support content with locking in a brand or Xerath that will either leave their carries for dead or just be more food for that assassin.

This isn’t limited to support either, it’s not uncommon for entire teams to draft only carries with little to no cc or utility that actually keeps the enemy snowball in check.",1641079345

Although I don't play this game anymore, I figured I share the design I created for him while I was at work. Yes, I also heard the news that Silco be in TFT and not league of legends. Anyways, enjoy!

&amp;#x200B;

**Silco - The Heart of Zaun**

Silco is a thoughtful slippery AD melee scaling support who specializes in singling out targets and empowering his most loyal of ally. Silco has a weak early game, but if he's allowed to stay even he can easily take over the entire game.

HP - 2/5 base | 3/5 scaling \]\[ Regen -4/5 | 3/5 scaling

Armor - 3/5 base | 3/5 scaling

MR  - 4/5 base | 3/5 scaling

Mana 4/5 base | 2/5 scaling \]\[ regen - 2/5 | 4/5

AD 3/5 base | 4/5 scaling

AS 2/5 base | 5/5 scaling

MS - 340

&amp;#x200B;

**Passive - Shimmer**

Upon 3 basic attacks or abilities, Silco fills a syringe with shimmer empowering his basic attack. Using it on a target will have different effects depending on if they're allies or enemies. Allies will gain a stack of shimmer giving them additional attack speed and adaptive damage. Repeated applications will reset and extend the timer of shimmer. Enemies with shimmer will be slowed and lose armor. This bonus scales with Silcos bonus attack damage.

**Q - Desperate Swipe**

Silco attacks in a wide area in front of him dealing physical damage. If silco's passive is active, this move can apply his passive on the first champion hit. If Silco is CC'd this ability can be used or finish casting and will deal double damage and apply shimmer. Damage is reduced for targets hit beyond the first. Low cd (8-5 seconds). (this hits 600 range in front of him).

**W - Hexheart**

Silco activates his artificial heart emits a burst of energy giving silco a shield that scales with attack damage and a short burst of movement speed. After a 4-5 seconds, the shield will explode dealing magic damage and slowing enemies in range. While the shield is active, the first enemy champion that is hit by silco is marked. If this target is attacked by silco or his allies, the shield gains HP. If silco reactivates this ability, he can pass the shield. If the shield is full, that target gains a stack of shimmer. 12 CD -&gt; 9.5 CD.

**E - Backstab (yes I know shacos E is also called backstab.)**

Silco jumps behind the target, stabbing them and kicking them forward dealing physical damage and pushing himself back. That target gains a stack of shimmer. This move can be used on allied minions. (No it isn't a poor man's 1 button insec, okay maybe a little) 15 CD -&gt; 10 CD (400 range)

**R - This Ones For Me**

Silco sticks himself with a massive vial of shimmer growing in size and unleashing a devastating backhand dealing physical damage, knocking enemies back and stunning them. While in this state silco takes heavily reduced damage. After the ability is over, Silco loses all bonus armor and MR. This will hit targets who are kicked forward from backstab.

180 CD - 120 CD

&amp;#x200B;

# Gameplan

Silco wants to take it slow in the early game and pick his spots carefully. His W-E engage is strong, but very risky. When level 6 hits, silco starts to become a force to be reckon with, however with the long cooldown on his ult and the cost of using it, you still need to be careful. Silco specializes in buffing his most loyal ally to a monsterous degree and singling out his enemies. Play back to get stacks of shimmer on diving tanks and bruisers, while peeling with backstab and W. Or even, pick out a single target from a fight and knock their team away with your ult. Silco doesn't mind a 1v1 if he has enough gold, but he works best with a friend.

**Weaknesses / counterplay**

Catching silco alone can be a death sentence for him, so look for picks. But in a competitive environment, it's best to put big pressure on his lane early and use AOE cc to stop him from stacking his W to shields the burst. Catching him with cc when he dives in can get him killed. Be sure to harass him if he tries to stack shimmer in lane.

Solo lane? Not recommended, you can probably pull it off. But his wave clear and early game are too bad to take him anywhere like that.

Jungle? It might be good, but you lose out on his passive and his clear would be dogshit. He has good ganks but his damage would be too low and his clears too slow.

(forgive me for not knowing any champ after veigo)

Syngergies - I basically designed him around his syngery with jinx (not really) but yeah that's intentional. Also consider pairing him with kog'maw or kai'sa. He'll even side with a piltovian like caitlyn who can cover him with her range and capitalize off of his cc. Champions who aren't super mobile or quick and attack fast work well with him. Tanks that can enable his engage (maokai, malphite, ornn) are also quite strong with him as well. He'd also be great with a seraphine who can bounce her ult off of him and the target he uses E on as well as help him peel for the carry.

**Counters him**

Caitlyn's outranges even his Q and never has to engage with him, ezreal can poke him down with Q and doesn't have to worry about his waveclear.  Malzahar can pick him easily with his ult, silence to stop him from doing anything and shrug off his CC. Mordekaiser can take him to the death realm (which also fits in nicely as a metaphor for fucking killing him). Morgana can easily land q when he uses e and stop his cc with black shield. Assassins can keep up with him and burst him down before he can take advantage of his passive or w.

**He counters**

Low mobility mages champs and especially Anivia. While she has the cc to stop him she needs to be on her toes and he singles her out stopping any teammates from saving her. Bruisers like darius are easily peeled off and shredded by shimmer against most defensive silco players. Whereas tanks fare no better if the game gets late enough, engaging tanks can get more than what they bargained for when he uses E to push them in and ult to keep the enemy team out.

**Build (Uhh I don't know)**

leagueoflegends,2022,1,"Hello League Community!  


This is something I've been working on this for the last month and a half or so, and I'm super excited to announce it today on the first day of 2022!

# League of Charity

This is charity group with a simple premise. I have volunteer coaches who are willing to give their time to help with this project. Anyone can request coaching, and instead of paying the coach, you donate to our fund that will go to charity. We have both League of Legends and TFT coaching. Feel free to join the server here: https://discord.gg/yrVte25n

# What charities does the money go to?

Right now, I'm only affiliated with LiNK, but the plan is to branch out to other charity orgs as the server grows. I'm still waiting to see how big of a thing this can become so that I understand the scale of this before I get too many other organizations involved. LiNK is a human rights group based in California that helps North Korean refugees adjust to life in the developed world.

# Can I be a coach?

Sure! I only have 6 right now, and I desperately need more people especially for top and jungle if I want this project to grow. The qualifications are simple: 1. Be passionate and excited about the cause. 2. Hit diamond in the game (tft or league) that you'd like to coach (it's recommended that you maintain diamond actively, but not required)  


If you're a coach, you're welcome to stream the coaching sessions if you're looking for some content for your growing youtube/twitch channel as well ;) just make sure you get the student's permission first.  


If you'd like to be a coach, message me a couple of sentences on why you'd like to be a coach. My discord is wawi#2599.

# I like the idea but I don't really want to pay for coaching

On one hand, I get it, but on the other hand this is....sorta free for some people? I think most adults have a budget set aside for charity each year, so in a way, this is money that you'd be spending anyways, you can just get some coaching on this dumb game that you're addicted to and spend too much time on in the meantime. :P",1641081229

leagueoflegends,2022,1,"I see lots of complaints about how the game is unbalanced and that it needs to change, but I rarely see any real suggestions for balancing. People always say ""200 years"" but don't say anything about what needs to change. Personally I don't even know where to start with balancing. Probably with items, but riot seems to like where their items are at(?) Lethal tempo definitely needs toned down. At least in the early game. 

But when it comes to champions I feel like it's harder to change just numbers. If you take away base stats it makes the nerfed champion objectively worse than one with higher stats. It's a rocky road. In my opinion I think making a champ deal less damage or have less resistance isn't the way to do it, but at the same time it's hard to change anything else without changing a Champs identity.

While you can stop mid dash with abilities, there's still a considerable number of unstoppable dashes and blinks which make getting into the backline easy.

To date the only characters with actual hard anti-mobility are Poppy and Cass. When are we going to get another champion with the ability to actually stop something like blinks?

Maybe it's because champions like that don't allow for flashy plays, and Poppy, when played well, doesn't let Lee Sin have the opportunity to make those spicy dash flash kick combos. But hey why do malphite/yasuo get to just both press R and win? Those of us that play warden tanks are left just to watch helplessly as the backline is torn to shreds and there's no character we could even have possibly picked to prevent it.",1641089608

Today I returned to it and was thinking, why not create a Cardgame based on games i like to play that have a rivality ?

My main ideas for now:

* The cards will use MTG card model.
* The gameplay will be based on MTG, Gwent, Artifact (Dota2 TCG that Valve arruined because of the awful monetization model) and will try to use LoR (played it a little but didn't got used to).
* Decks will be or Dota 2 or LoL (this probably will change as mixing Heroes and Champions will be funny).
* Heroes/Champios card will have 2 abilities based on in game abilities (I maybe add the other abilities as ""Magic"" cards).
* Obviously Cards that are items that will be equiped on Heroes/Champions.
* The board will be based in Gwent (The Witcher card game)  and will have 2 lanes (based on Artifact that has 3 ""boards"" that represent the 3 lanes)

The study evaluates the relative difficulty and reward for mastery of all the champions in League, based on different winrate stats across ranks, and, more importantly, across number of games played. However, I can’t seem to find any site which hosts the necessary “winrate by games played” data anymore. Champion.gg (the site used in the original study) no longer has this information, and while leagueofgraphs.com does show winrate by games played, it only goes up to 80 games, which is nowhere near as high as I need it to be. The data itself also seems a little wonky, though that might be because it’s so “zoomed in” on the first few games, so to speak. It would also be great if I could have access to this data across different patches, but I believe only Riot and e-sports teams keep those kinds of records.

leagueoflegends,2022,1,"So, I was doing some damage testing for Vel'koz with the practice tool.

My target was a single `dummy` with `3000 Health` and `100 Magic Resist`, and I noticed that when using `Shadowflame`, the damage I dealt was not matching what I had calculated earlier (by hand) - for all other items the hand calculation matched the practice tool.

I was wondering if I'm doing something wrong, or if there is a bug or something...

Shadowflame's passive goes as: Damage to champions benefits from 10 to 20 additional Magic Penetration based on their current Health... The wiki clarifies that you get the minimum Magic Penetration (10) if the target has 2500 or more Health.

So for my dummy; the damage calculation for one Vel'koz Q at max rank, equipped just with a Shadowflame, and without AP bonuses...

&amp;#x200B;

First I calculate the MR of the dummy, `100 - 10 = 90 MR`

Then I calculate the damage multiplier:

Where:

`dm` \- Is the damage multiplier

`MR` \- Is the Magic Resistance of the dummy, `90`

Which yields a **damage multiplier of \~0.526**

&amp;#x200B;

Then I calculate the Q damage:

Where:

`q` \- Is the Q damage

`AP` \- Is Vel'koz Ability Power, `100` in this case

Resulting in a **raw Q damage of  320**

Then I just multiply the Q damage with the damage multiplier:

For a **total damage of 168**

The **damage for the same scenario in the practice tool is 164**

(I have tried with other champions with the same result)

Can someone explain why there is a difference? Am I doing something wrong?

Why are caster minions the most invaluble compared to melee/cannon minions? This is just plain unfair and straight up discriminatory. Like, a caster minion is only worth 14 gold, while a melee minion is worth a whopping 21 G??? That's a 50% difference of actual living value right there, how is this ok? That isn't even the worst part too, because while melee minions are out there with their 50% extra, cannon minions are chilling being worth 60 FUCKING Gs. WHAT? It is quite literally a fucking 328.571% gold difference that has never been seen before, and what's even worse is that the gold for cannon minions INCREASES OVERTIME, all the way to 90 motherfucking Gs.

How? How is this ok? I've been staring at photos of caster minions for the past hour, crying my ass off, because while they suffer from such shame and disappointment from the game, they can't express their frustration as they hope someone out there can speak for them, and that hero they've been waiting for is fucking me. I want justice NOW. I'm done with this stupid fucking game. 14. 14 FUCKING gold. There's no way. THEY WORK JUST AS HARD. THEY DESERVE TO BE WORTH MORE. What if you were a caster minion? What if you were out here, trying your hardest, and then being told that you're worth no more than a snickers bar while your comrades get put on a high pedestal for carrying a sword or riding a fucking cannon? You know how hard it is for them to learn magic?

this is a [follow up](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/rt4pql/which_role_do_you_enjoy_to_play_the_most/) post for more thorough data.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm interested in seeing what the answers here are. Does r/leagueoflegends have a lot of support and mid players? a lack of bot and jungle players? Are those roles just less popular or is there a reason that people don't play them as often?

&amp;#x200B;

Regardless, this will also likely be followed up with another post in 2 days, a google form to try and specific more data about the biggest outlier role (likely to be support).

&amp;#x200B;

I'm expecting to make a rather large form now that I'm seeing that data. It will likely contain a lot of specific questions about each role. I would like to ask things about why you prefer the role, if you think the role is strong, what you like dislike about the role, as well as questions about sheer demographics (likely asking age, gender, rank, ETC). Huge info posts like this are HUGELY helpful to me and other people who enjoy making ""mega posts"" such as my previous \~5k word essays that you can find if you look at my profile.

leagueoflegends,2022,1,"The preset runes are... well, I shouldn't say *useless*, just *""sub-optimal""* for almost all champions, who would rather pick runes with better configurations. It just works out as a ""Better than nothing"" sort of thing if you end up needing to choose a champion you don't have a rune prepared specifically for.

&amp;#x200B;

[Here are the options that is given to everyone... I think? At least for me, it's like this.](https://preview.redd.it/ry28apknaa981.png?width=1003&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1c9a6e5d8ecbd255128cd14ef5babaa17a0e6a12)

However, I was curious to know; who exactly would do very well with these default runes, exactly?I don't have a lot of knowledge when it comes to knowing what a champion does, and I tried looking up a question similar to what I'm asking, but I had no luck finding anything.

It doesn't feel right to almost always ignore the preset options, since I want to at least know which champions I know I can use alongside a preset rune. This is in case I can't pick a champion with a rune prepared due to not working well with the team comp or something.

So, in your opinion; which champions do you think would benefit at least 80% min/maxed efficiency with one of the preset runes compared to a specifically designed rune already prepared for them ?

This is a question, but also an incentive for discussion, which I whole-heartedly encourage to spread around.

However upon returning to my account I am now suddenly honour level 2? I received absolutely no message as to why. And I’m fairly positive it’s impossible for me to have been punished in some way as I permanently play with chat turned of for both teams.

I don't like this direction and think it would be much better for the game as a whole if new champs followed the KISS method.  This stands for Keep It Simple Stupid for those who haven't heard the saying.

Champs like Akshan Viego and Yone just shouldn't have been made you could remove half their kits and still have functioning champions. 

Toxicity in game isn't on the rise because the player base are animals, toxicity is going up because of stuff like Akshan revive, Yone E and Viego getting resets and being untargetable every time he gets one did they honestly not learn anything from how people feel about Yi getting resets.  These 3 champs make me dodge every time they're on the enemy team because no matter what their win rates are they're toxic and no fun to play against.

I hope that a key consideration when making all future champs is creating something that isn't so toxic and frustrating to play against.  And a hint here is massive stealth, mobility and untargetablity should be non starters and not included in new champ kits.",1641143917

However DOTA 2 seems to be the more latest release , so I am also drawn to that quite a bit since it would have better graphics and more improvements.

Overall I just want to try out a MOBA that won't take me weeks to learn , I am willing to put in some hours though.

Master Yi says “One strike”, implying he only  swings once. However in Alpha Strike we see him in many locations appearing to swing multiple times. Perhaps it is only one swing. 


Consider if Wuju Style allows him to bend space and time, causing him to appear in many places with many swings but ultimately he never has moved. This could be supported by the fact he always returns to his original location..

Wu Kong, another practitioner of Wuju. Has the ability to “Decoy” and dash to you with multiple images of himself. What if this is just our primate warrior appearing twice or more on the same timeline?

I'm considering having the secondary runes be Resolve - with Shield Bash &amp; Revitalize, making her very shield tanky with Shield Bash proccing every 3ish seconds helping to keep damage up. Especially since Shield Bash would help a bit with early with jungle clear due to her passive.

Or would this just take way too long to get online? (I feel like I'm always trying to put the mana tear gear into builds only to remember how long they take to come online.)

&amp;#x200B;

I really like the idea of fimbulwinter, but it feels like it doesn't work great on many champs. The only one I've found thus far is a poke heavy Cho'gath, as the tear helps him spam Q early, and both his Q &amp; E proc the shield, but not worth taking Shield Bash/Revitalize.

leagueoflegends,2022,1,"So I recently got Akshan in an aram and was surprised at how amazingly fun it was to swing around Tarzan style so I decided to step into SR(rare these days) and practice Akshan.  It was then I realized that Akshan is the ultimate singed hunter.

Now, I get it, ""dont chase the Singed"" is classic league memes and usually good advice, but hear me out for a second because I think its safe to say everyone hates the dirty juice man as much as I do and would like to hear why Akshan is so good at sniffin shim. 

So first we've got his grappling hook which is fantastic for catching up to (and even getting in front of) enemies, but it will also often swing you OUT of the dirty Man's poisons.   


Second we have the Bangarang which is an on demand low CD ability that on both spit and swallow grants 40% movespeed so you can maintain auto distance.   


Now lets assume for a moment this known drug user is in fact on drugs and faster than you. Well its simple, if he's much faster than you what I noticed ends up happening is he will cancel your second auto by out-ranging you and that will automatically grant you move-speed as though you had purposefully cancelled it(take that pro players I can auto cancel too). But wait there's more! These are the smaller and more refined reasons why Akshan fits so smoothly into singed's glove. We're talking shields from his passive, the fact that a core item is wits end making singed unable to kill you by encircling you with the fart gas. And a long range execute for that 20% health singed just before he disappears into a shrub.

  
And last, but not least, in those moments when both you and the singed believe he escaped we have the W to help sniff out that filthy shim slinger and send him to the Viego realm.

So now its your turn, who's your go to gas trespasser?

Edit: this is all experience while the singeds were proxying behind tier 1 turret.

Edit 2: it's truly impressive to see half the replies be ""lol yeah right akshan can't beat singed"" and the other half ""wow so ur saying ranged top layers are OP BS? YEAH I KNOW IDIOT""

Oh looks like the enemy jungle karthus got a couple of kills and is strong too, should be fine still right? Then he ults and i lose 60% of my total hp, and his 1s cd Qs are doing about 50% of my hp bar, karthus has sorcerer void staff and shadowflame.

So yeah i effectively have 0 mr, so let me fix this by slowing down my build and snowball to get a negatron cloak! Now after slowing my build by almost 1000 gold i go from having 0 mr to having... 7 mr! I now quickly remember why i have been avoiding adc.

How is this in any world acceptable? Am i supposed to just go full tank as ad carries to not instantly die to anybody that gets 1~2 mpen items (which every single mage is building)? Oh right i guess im just supposed to go and and play a mage that can build shit like crown and hourglass, the only way for a squishy class to actually live in current league.

And dont you worry, magic damage is too weak and MR is too overpowered, so we are going to nerf wits end and shieldbow and do absolutely nothing about the current state of mpen, current damage levels in the game being this high is just not a fun experience and neither is having no counterplay (in fact, if you build MR you're basically throwing gold into a dumpster, you're helping the mage basically).",1641159366

leagueoflegends,2022,1,"Hi all! I'll like for you to help me if possible, I'm a returning player, I decided to create a new account to start off fresh. I've never played league on my own and even with friends it wasn't always on ranked games. But this year (2022) I want to be able to play by myself and see which heights can I reach.

&amp;#x200B;

But I need something, a main/s, I'll like to play top always if possible, but that'll be pretty hard, so I decided that top/mid will be a god pair for me to main, I could try jungle, but I'm always too scared to play that lane (too much pression and kind of micro-management with the other lanes). So for this, I will ask for your help, which champions do you think are good for this two lanes? (you can say up to 3, which I think is a fare amount). If possible, I have read that for low elo it's best to use easy champs rather than skill-focused ones. Feel free to recommend as many as you want for each type.

&amp;#x200B;

I know that for each season there will be tier lists and all, so that's why I'm asking for help, it's kinda hard to pick one from those lists if I don't know how viable they will be in a few months.

I've checked some win rates platforms and as of currently her win rate was really bad in all of them. In fact on [U.GG](https://u.gg/)  she has the worst win rate out of all support, only higher than the  ""off meta"" picks which isn't the best of titles to get. Now it could be  brushed off to inexperience, but the low win rates are the same across  all of the ranks. And people who had the best win rates on her, do not  even main her and have better win rates on other champions.

Another  thing I've noticed is the feeling of weakness while playing her. She  has so much in her kit, that some may call her overloaded. And yet she  never appears or have ever appeared to be called 200 years or so  compared to Sylas or Akshan (Other champions with nearly perfect kits).  Every time I see enemy pick her, I am always worried of losing to her  and yet I am able to pick almost any support (besides enchanters)  champion and win against her (primarly Nautilus, Veigar, Lux, since  those are some of my other mains). I thought it could be attributed to  the fact that she ain't a tank support, which for the most time where  the meta across almost all season. Yet it can't be? Her W although with  all it's downsides appears to be similar to Morgana, another stable  pick. And although lacking the ""no cc shield"", she has plenty of other  abilities to compliment for that.

I've  heard that her drop was ever since Glacial got reworked. Yet sometime  have passed and there is still no good win rates for her. And even  before Glacial collapse, her win rates there still quite bad. So what in  your opinion is really happening?",1641162085

leagueoflegends,2022,1," I have included those from last year, plus some of the most probable ones.

For me, Shyvanna or Skarner could win. Skarner because of his visual model, it is not bad but it does not make justice to his lore, and his kit (especially passive). Shyvanna with the huge engagement for the rework in countries like China and the interest in the last poll (she was the second most voted).

Note: I know there will be 5 options, Cho is the most probable fifth option, but I decided to include also Shaco. The poll allows just six options, I think Tryndamere is very unlikely.

leagueoflegends,2022,1,"After reading the short story ""Dead of Winter"" featuring Sejuani and Olaf, I have come to the realization that Olaf is an Absolute Giant of a Unit:

&gt; Shedding blood alongside Olaf the Berserker for many years had taught Sejuani that he was none of those things. Even on foot, he was easily the **biggest Freljordian she had ever seen**, the **equal of the mounted Sejuani and Urkath in height.** Some said **Olaf’s mother must have lain with a troll to grow so big**, but they never said it to his face. 

How large is Olaf? Like how immense is he actually? He is the biggest Freljordian Sej has ever seen and others compare him to the size of a troll, thus his height must be somewhere in between Braum (2.26m) and Trundle (ca. 5m). Sweet mother of Aurelion Sol! We're talking a behemoth of a man. He is comparable in height to mounted Sej. Sejuani is probably around 1.7-1.8m and Bristle may as well be 2m, that could mean Olaf is around 3m! 3m tall! He would look down on Braum as he was a child. 

Olaf is a real giant among men",1641166017
leagueoflegends,2022,1,"Hear me out here at least before I get down voted. Despite League of Legends' massive world and lores, very few characters have actually seen a lot of development. Thankfully, things are beginning to change with things like Arcane and Ruined King though.

Anyways, I would like to propose a thought experiment. Suppose you were caught in war, or at least the real prospect of it. There would be all sorts of emotions to be felt--trauma, fear, morbid satisfaction. There's a lot of room for character development at least. Even so, there's a surprising lack of character depth considering. Most champions have a personality and lore that very much go together as a trope. Garen is the walking embodiment of justice with a sword. Draven just likes himself and killing people. 

Seraphine on the other hand? We see the complex feelings she has dealing with popularity, pressure, depression, growing a career, all that. She's one of the most relatable characters in the cast, at least a lot more than everything known about Teemo, Azir, Darius, and Vayne put together. 

My question is why don't we see this with more champions who have a lot more to work with? I argue that it isn't that Seraphine isn't the pinacle of champion development, but that many other champions still fall below the minimum they need to stand beyond single tropes.

And no, Seraphine is only my number 2 highest mastery",1641166057

leagueoflegends,2022,1,"Hey everyone, this is my first Reddit post. I've been playing League for many years now on and off. I'm pretty casual so I'm hard stuck in Bronze, haha. I do enjoy watching high level play so I follow the esports scene even when I'm not actively playing.

I don't have many friends to share my story with, so I would like to share it with the League community. I was born with an extremely rare genetic disorder called nemaline rod myopathy (approximately 1:50,000 odds) which basically means I walk with a limp and I have difficulties doing everyday things due to my muscle weakness. I've been through severe depression (suicidal) because of it and other circumstances in my life. I've always been overweight, and at one point even hitting 210 lbs (I'm 5'8"").

In 2020 I told myself enough was enough. I was around 175-180lbs at that point and rapidly gaining due to the pandemic causing everyone to stay at home. However, I started eating healthier and pushed myself to exercise. Through persistence, hard work, and consistency, I dropped roughly 50lbs in about a year and I have been maintaining it since (very difficult!).

Anyway, I picked up nunchaku training (Youtube tutorials ftw) as part of my workout routine and I've been training almost every day for a year and 3 months now. Here's a short video I made today. I wasn't going for the 'Lee Sin' look but people might think that due to the red blindfold, haha. It has been a very, VERY, difficult journey getting to today, but it has all been worth it.

Hello all! I finally launched my website that I have been slowly creating for over a year now. The site is all about having fun with team compositions! The site features a team comp roller, where you can roll three different types of team comps - Themed, Random, and Pro.  


**Overview**

Pro comps are team comps taken from past professional LoL games. As of right now, all Worlds games (Quarterfinals and higher) are added to the site. These comps are for those who like to take the game a little more seriously, and could be a great drafting resource for Clash games!

Themed comps are hand crafted comps where the champions all have something in common. This could mean the champions are all from the same region (e.g. Zaun) or have some defining characteristic that they are share (e.g. Hook ability). These are fun comps to mess around with, even though some of them might be a *little* troll in order to make the theme work...

Random comps are just that - 5 fully random champions. This is the ultimate mental and physical challenge. Can your jungler keep it together trying to clear camps as jungle Yuumi? Only one way to find out!

Additionally, each team comp can come with a random modifier! The modifier can either be a rune or summoner spell that everyone must take, or an item everyone must build.

If you don't have enough people for a full team to run a comp, I created a Discord server that can be found on the website. I hope to make a community there for people who want to just goof off, play some wacky League games and have a fun time!  

&amp;#x200B;

I hope you have fun using the site and if you have any questions/comments/concerns feel free to DM me or join the Discord server that has a link provided on the website. I am a one man band, and this is my first ever website, so please be patient with me as I sort out any kinks that may arise! 

Thanks for taking the time to read this and check out the site, it means a lot to me!

 Metas being a big aspect of the game: constantly changing with patches and tuning. I was there for a pretty decent chunk of it, and even watching the ancient metas before I started playing myself. The oppressive Tank meta, the various assassin metas that phased in and out, the overbearing mage periods, and just about everything else. I'm not that different from most people, things like getting mad at new changes, because for most idiots like me, change=bad. But also, things like getting hyped for new reworks and other cool RIOT  creations, like Arcane. I think as a whole, RIOT does a pretty good job at balancing the game and keeping it in a decent state. Not always, but most of the time.

But for the past few months of playing casually, the game has stopped being fun at all. New champions rolling the old ones, regardless of if they do good or bad in game. And in particular, the COMPLETE over abundance of healing for everyone and their mother, has actually damaged the game incredibly badly. Grievous wounds going from a situational buy, to a MUST HAVE every game is absurd. It kills the notion of item diversity, when every game often feels like and arms race of healing items, often regardless of class. The Yone feeding lane, and  building a shield bow and deaths dance makes him as tanky as a tank, while killing everyone. The Jax top, with a Divine Sunderer and a Spirit Visage making him indestructible. The Soraka healing 1200 Hp to someone in 3 seconds, none of these things are fun to deal with. 

Those reasons above have built up over the past few months, to someone who plays a variety of roles casually, have killed the game for me. I can only imagine what people grinding ranked must feel on the daily.

I seriously think EVERY PIECE of healing in the game needs to be cut in half, then I would consider playing again. 

I know I'm just one person with a half baked take on one of the biggest games in the world, but I have played for 9 years. I think that adds just a little bit of merit to how I feel the state of the game is. Ive stuck through lots of shitty metas, but I feel the one we are in is the worst one to date.

Thanks for reading, hyped for season 2 of Arcane.",1641172781

leagueoflegends,2022,1,"While malding over certain champions being too frustrating to play against I decided to look up if Riot had adressed adding more than 10 bans ([ASK RIOT: I WANT MORE BANS](https://www.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/news/dev/ask-riot-i-want-more-bans/)). 

Besides the obvious - that your champ might get banned, I really think they should consider why champs have high ban rates: 1) It's broken af, 2)It's annoying enough to not want to deal with it.

From this point on it seems like it would be easy for them to understand why people ban the champion so much and maybe do something about: 1) the champ itself (kit, numbers, etc.) 2) runes/items.

People will argue that hating on the new champs is just wanting the game to be booring and statcheck-y, but on the other hand. Who in their right mind would ever want to play against Irelia, Yone, Qiyana, Akshan? Whenever I look at the 15 champs released since 2019, pretty much half of them i'd rather see banned every game because \*insert malding here\*

I know the bottom line is they probably will never increase the bans because most of their cash-grab nightmare champs would be perma banned. But just saying something as asinine as: ""Many of our positions and champion classes could be completely banned out with more bans."" without seemingly considering why that might happen is just surprising.

I’m also looking for unique ideas that you guys would like to hear discussed. Season 1 was amazing &amp; there’s so much good things to say about it.

leagueoflegends,2022,1,"I'm talking every game my enemy seems on par with my skill level but I constantly get 1 special gem who either afks, ints, or misses everything while catching everything. I'm getting S and A rankings, doing more damage as a tank than my damage dealers, while still tanking a crazy amount. These games aren't close. I was 120 and 100 at one point, now I'm 154 and 159??? How does that even happen. Yeah I'm not a God at the game or anything but these matches are the furthest thing from close you could get. I think I've won 6 of my last 21. Losing streaks are always ALWAYS 2-6 while I never hit 3 wins in a row. This wasn't a problem for the first 200 games so why is this so consistently horseshit all of a sudden
For reference my lux did 26k dmg and I did 40k as morde while tanking 80k, tammus had 100k tanked and everyone on my team was around 20k in tanked. What more do I do?",1641181685
leagueoflegends,2022,1,"Its almost upon us. My guesses are rammus, tryndamere, corki, and cho'gath

Rammus is rolling up to someone then you stand there as they slowly take damage. 

Corki is a short ranged adc that got evicted to mid who spams rocket skillshots as his main source of damage on a charge system although his aa's still do damage

Chogath has short range and no mobility. Every other warden has some way of getting close. He alao has no sustain outside of laning phase. 

Tryndamere is a smirmisher who has no teamfight capabilites what so ever. That's why he splitpushes. After he's done with that, he's a shit version of yi.
