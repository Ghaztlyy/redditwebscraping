You just get one shot by the Ekko and Talon. Garen chases you down and by the time you kite him to 70% health he's already killed you. Akali also one shotting you. I buy Guardian Angle. That helps me once every what, 3 minutes?

I might as well not even participate in team fights against champions like that. They simply wait for me to appear and proceed to delete me from the game faster than I can blink my eyes. Doesn't matter if I'm hiding in bush, behind my team, under my own tower. I just get deleted.",2020-01-01 00:00:37
leagueoflegends,2020,1,"So i decided to climb to master tier in season 11.
Im currently sitting in diamond 4 as the season ends.
Climbing to diamond has not been a big challenge for me in this seson, its was rather a challenge of time.

I have had enough and went to another server (eune-&gt;euw) but the same thing happened.

Currently maining jungle as a hecarim player but learnt some other champions(rek'sai,lee sin,graves etc..) in the preseason to further my knowledge about pathing, match ups and so on.

So im asking you guys here on reddit. Can you give me any tips or advice to improve myself as a player/jungler and possibly climbing to master tier at the end of 2020?

Thanks in advance",2020-01-01 00:04:57

leagueoflegends,2020,1,"Title. As it stands right now, there's a giant gap from early November all the way til late January where NA and EU fans and teams have basically nothing to do. For NA fans it's even worse since our teams always get eliminated early anyways (kill me please thanks). 

All-stars only takes up 3 days in early December and is basically the furthest thing from a **real** competitive event. On top of that only a few players actually get to participate. 

In China and Korea, the KeSPA and Demacia Cups take up a big chunk of that dead time during preseason, providing teams with real competitive practice while also giving fans something interesting to watch. The bracket format allows all teams in each league to participate, including academy teams in Korea. 

I think this format would be especially beneficial in NA and EU where BO3 or BO5 experience is few and far between. We'd get to see previews for all the new rosters. A tournament like this could also include academy teams from NA or regional league teams from EU. 

Idk what the community's opinion on this would be, but I'd personally love to see Riot do something like this for next year.

Edit: For people talking about player rest time - KeSPA and Demacia only last about a week and a half, less for teams that don't make it all the way to the end. Some teams also play subs (FPX for example).",2020-01-01 00:17:10

leagueoflegends,2020,1,"For this new year, I say that we go with new year, new game, and we completely remove flaming from the game. Yes its stressful, but never in the history of the game has calling someone a dickhead or a noob immediately made them play like they're in challenger. Its getting old, so if we can remove the toxicity from league, we can make the game fun again, and play it like normal people, instead of addicts that cant help but play another. Its honestly upsetting how many people still flame, and the happiness from getting a game with nice teammates is immeasurable because of the state it's been left in.

For new year, I promise I will never flame another player for acting a certain way. Theres no point, and it doesn't help, so instead I'll try and give helpful tips, like a nice person. We dont need to act like the toxic apes the public see us as, so just be nice. If it comes to it, just /muteall every game, and never say a word.

leagueoflegends,2020,1,"I recently started playing in solo lanes because I was a support main.

I realised in a game ,( I was playing pantheon mid into a yasuo) that I was waiting for so long to engage. My mindset is that I have to meet certain criteria in order to engage, in this matchup, it was so important that
-Yasuos passive shield was gone
-Yasuos windwall was down
Every time I wanted to engage both of these criteria had to be met because I thought that if he has passive shield he would negate some extremely important damage that would win me the 1v1.

I thought if he had windwall he would use it to block the killing blow of my fully charged q.

Often now I find myself doing this, making conditions for myself to go in. But I want an outside opinion as to if this is too limiting as it can take up to a minute to reach the right conditions and by that point I may have just been poked out of lane. I don't think I'm faker and I'm not bragging about my amazing strategy that's probably already used by everyone else, I just want to know if  it is too limiting for me in a solo lane",2020-01-01 01:07:45

leagueoflegends,2020,1,"Like realistically, do you ever feel that you have been bested by a better player when he plays those champs ?

Realistically you have yasuo irelia akali who have good potential but for the avg player which is btw 90% of this reddit, imense room for error. Sure their flashy plays seem unfair but realistically HOW OFTEN do you get an Akali/ire/yas to be that feared 1 v 9 carry solo killing a team ?


Then come the thicc quadruplr of morde nasus darius ilaoi who are basically ""get 6 win"".

Does it realistically feel fair when nasus runs you down with Qs and a pointclick wither ?

Is it fun when ilaoi grabs your soul and forces you to play league of tentacles ?

Is it fun when morde can legit miss parts of his kit yet still get carried by his passive ?

And darius ? I have seen chally players who had advantages against darius like tf or some koreans and one misplay and 0/2 darius beat 2/0 irelia  or camille

So idk... i cant imagine how difficult champs can like be more frustrating than literally right click bots or champs who spam abilities on CD hoping one hits and there goes your lane


Ofc an adc/mage player would feel frustration dealing with champs that can get to them/ avoid skills they throw...but sometimes think about the others who might want to play a melee into darius or an AS champ like Irelia vs nasus or some melee imobile thing into ryze...",2020-01-01 03:49:28

leagueoflegends,2020,1,"In this post i want to look at what may happen in the future for Runetera.

Since the major Lore Retcon that removed the League of Summoners from cannon I've been noticing the lore of Runetera moving towards a very large event. Particularly, a battle. 

**Keep in mind this is all theory that i have constructed by digging deep into the lore of Runetera. Weather or not this event happens is up to Riot and their Lore team.** 

Lets start with Targon. Its peak is where, so far, all the Aspects of Targon have appeared. These aspects are: Diana, Aspect of the Moon. Leona, Aspect of the Sun. Pantheon, Aspect of War. Taric, Aspect of the Protector. Zoe, Aspect of Twilight. 

Of what the Aspects know of the coming event. 

Diana, within the temple of Lunari, saw a battle painted on the walls, of gold and silver warriors fighting an unending horde of monsters while the sky rained comets. She also has fragment memories from previous hosts of the aspect, though incomplete. 

Leona has complete knowledge of what to come, as her Aspect memories are unbroken, though we don't know what she knows as it is not explained in the lore text, only that she wont speak about it, she will only speak of what she knows to Diana. 

Pantheon, fully controlled by the Aspect and not Atreus, hunted Darkin specifically. After the Aspect fell to Aatrox, Atreus mortal will kept him alive. He may have knowledge of what the true enemy is, his mind having been in contact with the mind of the Aspect. but with the Aspect itself and a conscious being, dead, Atreus wont have direct access to those memories like Leona or Diana, nor does he appear to be seeking them out, aside from hunting them as beings of great power. 

Taric, appears to know the full purpose of the aspects. it is directly stated in his lore that he stands as the protector of Valoran against the void. 

Zoe as the current oldest host appears to know the most, and appears to have a close relationship with Aurelion Sol. 

As the current situation, all Aspects aside from Diana with her broken memories appear to be keenly aware that the Void is the enemy. 

Now we look at Aurelion Sol. While under Targons control, he was forced to fight the creatures of the Void and seal the Void Rifts they came through. Currently Targon can barely control him. If he breaks free of them it is uncertain weather or not he will partake in repelling the void from Runeterra, as he both despises Targon, though that may simply be Targon Prime and not the residents of Mount Targon, and his arrogance may keep him from caring about protecting the world he considers insignificant. However, he does have a quote ""Darkness is my only true enemy."" Which could simply refer to a lack of stars in the sky, but also could be a nod the the Void, as in the short story 'Twin Dawns' he does note that only something highly intelligent could have made the rift in which the Voidborn come through. Suggesting a much vaster power than that we have seen exists within the Void. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now lets look at the void itself, as we have mentioned it enough. 

Starting with the Watchers. The Watchers are from the Void. They appear to be the only intelligent entities to come from the Void. They created the Voidborn in order gather information on the material world. Their world destroying intent is stated in the Void lore page. Their original attempt was in the Freljord where they turned humans into immortal Iceborn servants. Avarosa led the rebellion against the Watchers which led to their being sealed in True Ice below the Howling Abyss. This seal is slowly fading over time however. In the meantime the Voidborn are their eyes, ears, and hands. 

The Void currently breaks through mostly in Shurima, which had large rifts open up during the rebellion of Icathia. Shurima spent many years fighting to seal these rifts. Many ascended (artificial aspects) died doing this, those that survived where permanently scared, physically and mentally. 

&amp;#x200B;

Looking briefly into Shurima.

With the deaths of many Ascended during the Void war and even more during the Darkin war that followed the death of Azir, only Nasus and Renekton appear to remain of the god like warriors capable of fighting the Voidborn, and even then, Renekton has gone insane and will not be of any help. Nasus who remained largely out of the Darkin war remains probably the only Ascended warrior that can be relied upon to aid Targon, who gave Shurima the technology for ascension in the first place. Yes Azir has returned but will probably only ever take to the battlefield if his people are directly under threat. However, new ascended may come to being as the Sun Disk is now functioning again. 

The Darkin, while once servants of Shurima will probably be absent from the battle as they no longer have the same goal. In fact the Darkin are more likely to side with the Watchers, as at least Aatrox desires world destruction. 

&amp;#x200B;

Who else might be at the battle. 

As it is noted in this [Swains Prophecies post](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/eho2i1/swains_prophecies_taking_a_look_again_at_swains/), Swain knows that the Void has ""learned to be alive."" Noxus also borders Shurima, a hot spot for Void Rift activity, as well as the location where Rek'Sai is building a Void Rift. It is possible that Swain may have Noxus partake in the battle. 

Freljord is the location where the Watchers are sealed. Lissandra knows that there is a clock on how long she can keep them sealed. It is entirely possible that of the 3 factions, she will preempt the event of a large scale Void attack and send military units to the battle. Accounting for travel time and being late to the battle wont be an issue as she will know before everyone else. Weather the other 2 factions in Freljord will also send troops to the battle is unknown. If the battle is in Shurima none of the 3 may even partake in the battle for fear of having to deal with the Watchers directly at the Howling Abyss. 

Kassadin and Malzahar are both guaranteed to be at the battle, as Kassadin hunts Malzahar, and Malzahar is aiding the Watchers by opening Rifts. Kai'Sa will likely be there as she currently roams Shurima hunting Voidborn. 

&amp;#x200B;

I could probably go on but i have already spent a large amount of time writing this block of text. I would like to see some discussion in the comments as i am always interested in what other people think the direction the Lore is going. Of course i havent mentioned Ionia, the Shadow Isles, Piltover or Zaun in this because they don't currently appear to be connected to this event.

Kim Hyuk-kyu, DragonX’s (DRX) adc - ""Deft"", has set his sights on the League of Legends World Championship. Kim Hyuk-kyu, who is preparing for the 2020 season with Yeong-gun (very young players), shook his head, saying, ""it feels like I am in high school again"". He expressed his expectations for the next season, saying that ""the growth of the newcomers is scary. (Pyosik and Keria)""

DRX beat Spear Gaming 2-0 in the first round of the quarterfinals in the ""2019 LoL KeSPA Cup ULSAN"" at Nexon Arena in Seocho-dong, Southern Seoul on Monday. DRX, which advanced to the second round of the quarterfinals, will face DAMWON Gaming on the 31st of December.

Deft, who met with the Kookmin Ilbo after the match, did not hide his expectations for new players, saying he still has a lot to improve. He praised ‘Pyosik’ Hong Chang-hyon and ‘Keria’ Ryu Min-Seok, saying, ""These young, hardworking players can do anything.""

Q. You ended up winning the first round of the quarterfinals, the SPG match.

Deft: The first game revealed all our shortcomings parts in lanning and team fighting. There is a lot to be improved. We were behind in kills, but the main objective for us was to have a good game. The main objective was not obtained, because we messed up lane assignments. Even in the dragon fight, we often lost because we did not hold the correct formation nor angle of approach for the team fights. In the second game, the choice to summon Rift Herald botlane was our biggest mistake. Other than that, I think I’ll know when I watch the games again.

Q. The KeSPA Cup is also a competition to boost teamwork.

Deft: Our team has nothing that could be called teamwork yet. The jungler and support of our team are complete rookies. Teaching the basics of team fights to the new players should be prioritised. I think it was a team effort that they've mastered the basics. These players learn fast. I think young, hardworking players like them can do anything.

Q. Is there anything else you want to get from the KeSPA Cup besides your score?

Deft: I've won KeSPA Cup once, and I've also been eliminated right away before. Each experience had its merits. When I won, I took confidence and momentum. When I was eliminated, I could realize the seriousness of the situation. Personally, I think it helped me learn when I was eliminated.

Q. Unlike last year, you are the only veteran player on the team. Do you feel the difference in roles?

Deft: Last year, our team members had a lot of experience overall. They were about my age. So, each of us played a role. However, the players are all young this year. It's been a long time since I was in high school, and I think I'd feel like that if I went to school. It’s very fun to watch team members play well among themselves.

Q. What is your goal for the 2020 season?

Deft: Personally, I want to find the right style for the team and perform that style. This year, I had many happy memories, but I missed opportunities to win. This year's team members are very likely to grow. I want to do my best and go to the final round of the League of Legends World Championships. I've only imagined myself on the stage of finals every day. I think it's time to make it a reality.

Q. HLE mainly used non-AD carry strategy, and they utilized botlane Irelia in today's game.

Deft: I don't think any of the current AD Carry champions will have much impact on the game except for Miss Fortune subsequently non-AD carry is a trend that appears a lot. I am also playing this and that in scrims and SoloQ games. I can play them if the opportunity presents itself.

Q. The next opponent in the match is DWG. The team has something to pay back when it comes to the World Championships selection.

Deft: Actually, today’s game wasn’t easy. That's why the match against DWG will be a good gauge of our current performance. I'll do my best to prepare. I hope it will be a game that has a lot to teach us.",2020-01-01 07:45:37

leagueoflegends,2020,1,"When they're just wrong, or not as good as their opponent. 

This topic has been brewing in the back of my head for a while now, as the term has become a bit of a hot button for the community. 

According to the ""Summoner's Code"" Intentional Feeding, or Inting, is dying to the enemy team on purpose to grief your teammates. This is reportable, and if someone is doing it you should definitely take the time to do so after the game. 

The problem is the community has started to use the term for anyone who is taking a fight that they know that person will lose. You see the enemy champion with multiple kills, your teammate walks up and get slapped down, again. You accuse them of inting. They vote no at 15. They vote no at 20. Your lead goes out the window in the face of a super fed enemy carry and the game turns into a 30 minute slog that ends with you all screaming at each other in post lobby. You report your teammate for inting, but nothing ever comes of it but bad feelings all around. 

Sound familiar?

Consider this instead. 

Your teammate does not know the matchup very well. This is the first game or the day, or their 15th game of the day. Maybe they've been awake for 5 minutes or more than 24 hours. Maybe their main was banned, or they're trying out a new champion. Maybe the cat won't stop jumping on the keyboard, or their roommates are screaming at each other.

Maybe they just hit a power spike, or finished an item. Maybe the first few kills were because of jungle interference, lag, or misplay. Maybe they saw a misplay, maybe they thought the enemy was alone and they had man advantage. 

Maybe that teammate was just wrong about the situation and didn't know better. Maybe they didn't know an alternative way to solve the problem but keep fighting and try to win the next fight, and the one after that, and the one after that. 

Maybe they keep trying to dig themselves, and the team, out of a hole of their own creation. Maybe they realize some or all of this, and they're not saying anything for a reason. Maybe they're trying really, *really* fucking hard to win but the enemy champion is just better than them at every turn. Maybe they misplayed once or twice and if the game goes to 35 minutes instead of 30 they'll come back...

... but they're so damn demoralized by their teammates accusing them of ***purposefully killing themselves*** to give the enemy team the win and trying to /ff at every turn that they're not going to see a late game team fight. Even if they did, one or more of their teammates is so tilted at them that they straight up don't want to play the game any more. 

Maybe that person is depressed, and you don't realize it but you're accusing them of committing suicide by proxy. 

\------

Got a little heavy there at the end, but I think I've made my point yeah? Call it feeding, call it dying too much, maybe take the time to provide some advice or go group with them to prevent further deaths.

But don't call it Inting. That's against the Summoner's Code for a reason.",2020-01-01 08:17:00

leagueoflegends,2020,1,"Let's discuss what makes a kit OVERLOADED. It's a term people like to throw around, but it's generally just used to mean that a champion has more than one strength. While there is some merit to the accusations for many champions, there are also many others for whom the idea is just ridiculous. This post is intended to clear up the confusion between ""overloaded"" and ""overpowered.""

Let's start by talking about what it means for a champ to be ""overloaded."" The existence of champion overload implies two concepts: a.) That champions have some sort of ""load"" that is borne by their kit, and b.) that a champion who bears more than their share negatively impacts balance. Perhaps the best example of an overloaded kit is release Azir. While he was not exactly *overpowered,* his kit carried significantly more weight than the kits of other champions. His laning was dominant and high-pressure, with superior range and inescapable harass shutting all melee mids out of the meta, and his mobility keeping him safe from incoming ganks while threatening a dive if the opponent got too low contesting farm. On top of that, he was a hard-scaling hyper carry with insane damage potential, and he hit that spike with just two items thanks to his CDR passive. And then on top of *that,* he was a playmaker who could demolish an entire enemy team with the Shurima Shuffle. And then, on top of *that*, he had the ability to shove towers down if left alone. 

What this effectively meant was that not only did Azir fill the role of his toplaner and support as splitpusher and initiator, he could do both within the same game while also filling the role of his ad carry as a hyper scaling win condition and tower pusher.

Now let's take a look at Pyke. He's lane dominant, with good sustain and slipperiness combined with cc. In teamfights, he can make important picks and chain-kill enemies with his ultimate. However, the hats he wears end there. He has no wave clear, no damage threat onto tanks, and is highly threatened by enemy CC due to his nature as a melee assassin. While he may FEEL overloaded due to being unpokeable in lane while scaling hard, he only carries so much of the game's load. 

Similarly, while Akali has a ton of mobility and seemingly tacked-on stealth mechanics, she has low playmaking ability in teamfights beyond diving for the ADC, and does not threaten towers in a splitpush. Zed is very similar in this way. Both champions may be a little overtuned in terms of damage numbers, but they certainly do not wear nearly as many hats as Azir did. 

In a lot of ways, ""overloaded"" has come to mean ""I died to this and it felt unfair."" And to be clear, there is a lot of merit to that. But let's be clear: Akali shitting out lethal damage from stealth over the course of 5-6 seconds is unfair, not overloaded. Pyke yanking you out of lane to get demolished is annoying, not overloaded. Overloaded means a champion wears a lot of hats - playmaker, guardian, hyper carry, midgame carry, lane bully, tank, assassin, hook, splitpusher - NOT that a champion has a lot of mechanics. Jhin has a lot of different interlocking pieces to his kit, but his hats are well-defined and there are too many things he simply cannot do. As opposed to champs like Azir or Lee Sin with fewer mechanics but who checked most if not all of the boxes on that list in their respective primes. 

Let's not forget it was Riot themselves who introduced the term ""overloaded."" It's ridiculous to assume that they are blithely introducing more and more overloaded champions in defiance of their own language for talking about them. Let's put the blame where it really lies: overpowered interactions and overtuned numbers that make newer champions incredibly frustrating to have to play against.",2020-01-01 10:26:09

leagueoflegends,2020,1,"Starting this off by saying I realize most players probably aren't like me. 

I am the type of player who likes to main one champ/role for a few months at a time before hopping onto something else. A short-term one trick. I started with Irelia (the patch she was released), then Poppy, Sona, Janna, Maokai, Brand, Lux, Soraka, etc. Whenever I hopped to a new champion, I would typically buy all the skins available for that champion at the time. Actually, a new skin release plus being bored with current champ was often the reason I hopped every few months. 

However, with this new skin system, my collector's OCD can not be satisfied. Almost every new skin comes with limited availability chromas, boarders, and icons. For whatever reason (again, prob OCD) I don't like picking up a new champion with skins I can not obtain. This used to only be a few champions out of the 140+, but now it's becoming almost every champion who gets a new skin, especially skins released during events with passes. 

I originally though that although this was annoying, I would, at most, need to wait one year before getting any chromas/boarders I missed in the past. However now with the winter skin chromas not returning this year, it seems like some champions will require 2+ years of waiting if I want to gather all of there skins/chromas. :/

The current system makes me not want to buy RP at all, because I'd rather not buy anything than only be able to buy a piece of something. 

TLDR: I wish we could get some normal skins without weird limited time shit tied to them like we used to. It feels impossible to complete a ""collection"" for any one champion unless said champ is a new release. The boarders, limited chromas, locking icons behind bundles, etc is making it harder and harder to swipe my card to support this game.

Now I notice that my winrates are very low, I have a 39% and 37% winrate respectively on 2 of my most played champions - Thresh and Neeko. (yes I play neeko supp) Those winrates are over 20 ish games

Does that mean I'm just bad? I recently got a yellow demotion shield on my profile and though I blame it on my friend sneaking into my account at 3 am and losing me 8 rankeds in a row (I changed my password now) I think the problem is me. I'm not one of those ""my teams all suck and thats why I dont climb"" guys, I'm a firm believer that there are 2 things that win games more than anything else; vision control and a good, tilt-proof mentality. (and the ability to not hard int I guess :D)

I dont ever feel good killing an Akali because I know it wasnt a play at my control, it was her fucking up. She has too much agency(ability to make choices) that a failed play is more than likely her outplaying herself rather than you outplaying her.

This is because of what thy title mentions. Only ever reason that you may have not noticed this before is because Akali's you matched agaisnt didnt abuse it. 

Give her less agency so that there is less oppurtunities, less good choices and overall more healthy from her by not being able to compensate every bad play she does with another good play.",2020-01-01 13:19:33

If one of these scenarios is the case:

   \-Supp/Jungle bad/behind

   \-Supp/Adc bad/behind

   \-Adc/Jungle bad/behind

the games are mostly over. I find this particulary frustrating since im only talking about 2/5 players being behind, thus meaning your team should theoreticly be ahead. I take issue with the fact that if these players are behind it impacts the game so heavily that the remaining 3 players often have a near impossible job to win the game (f.e. perma roaming support that deals a lot of dmg, with jungle that can just do every drake and granting humongus leads). 

I dont think the game should work like that at all, tbh. I would really like to always be ahead when most players of the team are and not having to hope that these 3 players know what to do because elsewise you are basicly fucked.",2020-01-01 13:19:56

Furthermore, the coach is not the person who controls the draft the most, the players definitely have a bigger say. Even if the coach has the “last say” in the draft, he gets his knowledge of champion strength and whatnot by asking his players.

A lot of people these days use the coach as the scapegoat whenever a popular or good team loses (see: SKT, TSM). However, that’s only because they don’t realise what I just said is the reality behind drafting. It’s not the coach who is at fault, it’s mostly the players.

The ONLY good MR items in the game are spirit visage and merc treads. 

The other items are either:

A) too expensive

B) too weak

C) too situational to the champion you are playing

D) all of the above

&amp;#x200B;

I have 2 suggestions:

1) Bring back FON, Force of Nature.

2) Create a new MR item, like sunfire cape (moonfire cape?), with the same unique passive, just granting MR instead of armour.

&amp;#x200B;

Right now if the enemy picks 4AD you can stack armour very efficiently. 

If they pick 4AP you can't do the same. It's actually not possible to itemise against mages, especially due to the fact that magic pen items are incredibly cheap and powerful. Along with most other AP items being too cheap for how strong they are - giving too much stats.",2020-01-01 14:48:36

leagueoflegends,2020,1,"- Instead of being LOL’s Invoker, the champion is far easier to play than play against, due to the combo of being AA-based and several guns being overtuned. It is far easier for Aphelios to use any combo of guns than for the opponent to consistently change game plans.

- Crescendum is an AA mechanic that truly deserves its own champion, one with multiple distance-modulating abilities (possibly the old Quinn and Valor kit?) There should be constant decision-making between safety/distance and DPS, but because of his lack of mobility and overtuned damage, the whole mechanic seems wasted on Aphelios.

- Infernum does not feel like a flamethrower. I was very curious to see how a Rumble-style flamethrower would work on an AA champion, but the current set up would feel better if he was lobbing grenades. Besides, this gun is a balance nightmare.

I wish they stuck to 3 guns but with far more pronounced strengths and weaknesses, such that not having one available could be a real hindrance in a situation. For example:

Calibrum: 650 range

Gravitum: 550 range, AS does not scale. Instead, slow strength scales with bonus AS

Severum: 450 range, increased lifesteal to compensate

I feel this would’ve forced each gun into a niche and been more fun to play as and against. Thoughts or other suggestions?",2020-01-01 20:02:11

The items are a lot more niche than Quicksilver Sash or any Grievous Wounds inflicting item, as Stealth is not as prevalent in the game as Crowd Control and Healing, hence why I think we could increase its stats a bit to compensate.

It would also finally give counterplay to stealth as a mechanic. Oracle Lens is cute and works to a certain extent, and ""countering a champions entire existance with 75 gold"" argument always pops up in discussions about having Pink Wards reveal stealth again, so I think there could be a middle ground where you instead counter it with a 1300 gold investment rather than multiple 75 gold ones, similar to how a Quicksilver Sash is bought to counter Skarners Impale or Malzahars Nethergrasp.

Think of it as a QSS tax, but with a new item that offers better stats to compensate for its niche usage.

The rune is clearly broken and being abused by too many champions that weren't really a problem before the rework to the rune. My suggestion is to remove the adaptive force and have the healing start from the 1st stack 20% max for melee 10% for ranged. Starting at 1,2,4,6,8,9,11,15,18,20 Melee would still get 2 stacks per auto with ranged getting 1. The higher healing is to address some lost power from the removal of Adaptive force.

Removing the Adaptive force would mean only champions that value the healing such as Aatrox would still take the rune instead of mages like Cassio or Ryze or Assassins like Akali Junglers like Lee Sin Garen who can basically instastack it with his Spin.

I understand that high ranked players want to play normal games to practice new champions and such. But a master player will fundamentally be better than a silver/gold or even plat players. Which in turn ruins the gaming experience for casual players like me.

Feel free to prove me wrong but wouldn't it just make more sense? U need to be good at the game to get to diamond, so even if I may have more games played than someone who's diamond, that player will be better because he/she put a lot of hard work into getting better at the game.

Of course u could be Silver 4 with a diamond 1 friend u want to casually play normals with, that's totally understandable but there are definitely more than enough player playing this game for MM to at least make somewhat fair teams. (Something like smurfs and such I understand that riot games/MM can't do much about of course)

yes this was written after a series of defeats, but even when I win a game because it happens to me it is not exactly fun either? The most fun u can have in this game is when u have 2 even teams, and I shouldn't have to play ranked to have games like that.",2020-01-01 21:43:48

I want to know how this Ryze is allowed to play games and ruin others chances of winning due to his trash internet? Why is he not locked out of games with people like me who have a ping under 20 all game, every game?

Now onto the second point of this post, the absolute disgusting-ness of this un-killable Chogath. Despite building grievous wounds and our whole team focusing him he was able to tank it all and end the game 33/1!!! He healed for 16.5k damage over the course of a 35 minute game, along with dealing 56.3k damage! We got him down to about 1/6 of his total HP at one point (Still over 1k) and then he walked into the jungle and came back out about 10 seconds later with full HP!?

In an interview with RNG's Beijing manager Bi Lianli, she said and I quote "" it wasn't unusual for some players to be paid six-figure sums of yuan annually, in addition to any winnings."" 

Note: Six-figure sums of yuan is about $150,000 USD.  

The way she puts it seems to imply that not all RNG members earn six-figure a year and that six-figure is the max a player could earn cause otherwise she would have said 7 figures or 8 figures instead.  This means UZI's salary is less than $150k!  

Upon learning this I became quite upset to be honest.  It is pretty clear now that NA teams have no idea what they are doing and are grossly overspending on domestic talent! Like instead of paying Wildturtle 700k a year Flyquest could just get the UZI/Ming duo for less than $300k.  And instead of paying Huni $1.15 mil why didn't DIG just get TheShy? I mean as popular and good as he is, he couldn't possibly earn much more than UZI.  So his salary is probably $200-250k USD max.

We all know that Yuumi stays on a champ for as long as she wants and its annoying. What if a knock up/displacement kicked Yuumi off a champ and put her W on a 3-5 second cool down. Now im not saying she is OP or anything like that but the fact that she can hop from one champ to the next with no counter play. Yes she has been nerfed pretty hard but what im suggesting is if this is implemented then obviously she would need some buffs so she is playable. This way there is some kind of form to make sure Yuumi isnt basically on a champion throughout the entire game. Also makes sure that Yuumi players cant just afk on a champion, they have to pay more attention and position properly to make more plays. There is only 54 (55 with Sett) champions with a knock up/displacement in the game, that is about 1/3 of all champs so there are about 2/3 of champions left without one. There can still be some games where Yuumi can be basically on a champ all game if your/enemy team doesnt counter pick her and she will still be strong. Just with any strong champ if you dont pick a counter to them they will thrive, like Master Yi who can just hard carry if your/enemy team doesnt have hard cc for him.

10) Golden Guardians - Grade:D-

&amp;#x200B;

Explanation:  
Team Liquid - I don't actually see Broxah as a huge upgrade for the overall team of TL, but I don't think his impact will necessarily be negative either. The team dynamic might change up a little, and that might be the strongest point for the Broxah acquisition. Other than this, they still remain the team to beat with top players in each position. I think the only  bot lanes with the potential to challenge Doublelift and CoreJJ for the split will be 100T, TSM and DIG, each with their own caveats. Impact will likely remain a solid rock in the top lane unless Broxah's playstyle trends more towards the topside of the map, in which Impact will likely demolish his opponents, and if not Impact, Jensen might find some newfound synergy with his new jungler. This team is neither an upgrade or a downgrade from the previous year in terms of player strength, but the rest all depends on how Broxah affects the team dynamic.

&amp;#x200B;

TSM - Player strength wise, TSM is the only other team with the potential to topple TL at their best. Each of their players that they have acquired has the potential to topple their direct opponent. Dardoch's personality clashes seem to be a thing of the past, with successful stints on Optic and Echo Fox that lasted for each respective year. If Dardoch manages to take over the jungle this split like he did with Echo Fox, and manages to provide Brokenblade and Bjergsen with the firepower they need, this team would have the strongest top side of any team in the region, and from what I can understand about Kobbe and Biofrost, the bot lane will attempt to have a somewhat even lane and be a stable source of lategame proactivity. Dardoch and Biofrost are apparently rather vocal members for shot calling, so I could see this working out rather well. The biggest caveat to this team is that the team dynamics might not work out to be as strong. Despite this, I think at worst, this team achieves a 3-4th place finish due to their pure strengths demonstrated over the consistent high performances of Dardoch's and Bjergsen's careers.

&amp;#x200B;

EG - This team definitely has all the right pieces to surge to the top of the LCS. However, it all relies on everything playing to an optimal level. Every player aside from Kumo, who is an effective rookie, has been tried and tested before, and has extremely high variance. Bang was a solid member for 100T, but rather forgetable. Svensekeren just got the MVP award, but prior to that has always been in and out of the upper echelon. Jiizuke just came away from EU having a rather poor split, but at the same time he was a core piece in the Vitality effect in 2018 worlds. Zeyzal has just come off a forgettable year as well, but that was after having a rather good year in 2018. Kumo is promising, but he also seems to require a fair amount of resources. This teams high variance has me reluctant to put them in the top 2, but at worst thy barely miss playoffs. 

&amp;#x200B;

CLG - In short, this team has upgraded in the mid lane, and downgraded their support role. Smoothie's time on TSM wasn't the best, but he was still a solid support for the most part. Crown looked exceptional on Optic however. This is yet another team with potential. However, what makes me reluctant to place them higher than other teams listed above, is the fact that most of their pieces have been tried and tested. They are consistent with the exception of Wiggily, who seems to be aging quite nicely as a more than capable jungler. Sure, you have Ruin making inconsistent plays all game, randomly dying whilst also sometimes pulling off a clutch play, but in the grand scheme of things, you expect Ruin to play like this. With Stixxay and Smoothie, we know that we can expect them to consistently perform to levels anywhere from 5th to 3rd in the LCS. And that happens to be where I think the team will place when the split comes to an end.

&amp;#x200B;

100T - This team has a little more variance than CLG. Ssumday and Meteos have remained consistent figurepieces of the LCS since they've joined, consistently enjoying the successes of each roster they have participated in. Ssumday has been an MVP calibre top laner through most of his time in the LCS, with last year being a smudge in his otherwise sparkly career. Meteos was just a core piece of the Optic duo that carried them through to playoffs in spite of their lackluster top and bottom lanes. This is the entirety of their team's consistency however. Whilst many people tend to give Cody Sun a lot of credit for the resurgence of Clutch last year, I tend to credit the management of Dignitas with their success a lot more. I don't think Cody Sun will often be the reason this team loses, but he will barely ever win through lane. He plays much more like a Zven or Bang than a Piglet, Doublelift or Stixxay, with the latter three having moments of brilliance in their LCS careers as the pinnacle of lane dominance. I think if Stunt can bandaid this laning deficiency with some intelligent roaming like Olleh in Immortals, this team could be quite the spectacle. However, that leaves one more piece of the puzzle. Ry0ma. This is the most important piece for this team's success quite frankly, and their success is left on the line of how good Ry0ma actually is. If he performs to a top tier calibre, this team could easily compete for first, but likewise, he could be the only mid laner worse than Goldenglue. My suspicion is that he will perform fine, and play a rather stable lane, but I don't think he will reach the levels of some of the top talents. I personally think that this team had no reason to choose Ry0ma over Pobelter, as Pobelter could have been a nice fit on this roster. I don't think this team would ever achieve a last place finish in the LCS, but I don't think Ry0ma will be strong enough to get this team into semis. At worst, I think this team is 8th, at their very best, 3rd.  


Dignitas - To me, this org proved it's worth last split in the revitalization of Clutch Gaming. This gives me faith that this team will overperform my power ranking of them, much like C9 which I will talk about next. The core of Huni, Froggen and Aphromoo have all had their share of triumphs and failures, and whilst lately, Aphromoo and Froggen have seen more failures, I suspect they will be perfectly  fine with Dignitas. Aphromoo's shotcalling and experience for example will be crucial for guiding the mechanically gifted rookie adc, Johnsun. His plays last year on 100T were less than desirable, and he often cam out looking like the bad end of the joke, however, his consistent high level prior to this allows me to forgive one bad year on a roster that never had a decent mid laner. Enter Froggen, a mid laner that seemed to never be able to find a good team. Froggen seems to get a lot of community backlash as being washed up or a poor performing player, and I think that this comes entirely from results driven analysis rather than actually watching him play. As someone who is a fan of Piglet, I entirely feel sympathy for Froggen's plight in recent years as the narrative grows stronger. Nothing is worse than having your reputation buried by bad rosters and bad orgs, and fans who look entirely at team placement instead of including a performance based analysis. Much like how Piglet was the biggest reason Clutch won games during Spring Split 2019, Froggen was the main reason with Hauntzer that GG could make playoffs, and it was their performances alone that allowed this team to have any threat whatsoever. Furthermore, this team has secured Huni, a staple top laner who really improved over the course of Summer last year to outright carry Clutch to worlds. The main caveat in my view is Grig, who has never been a remarkable jungler. Johnsun is a rookie, so I don't rate him particularly highly, however, all he needs to be is serviceable in order to provide value to his team. As long as he can compete with LCS talent and go somewhat even with his counterparts, he will be fine. Grig on the other hand has a harder task where he must be more proactive in trying to get the most out of both Huni and Froggen. I think Grig is more important to this lineup than any other player on any other org. He is not known to be very proactive, which is really what this team needs in their jungle position, and that holds me back from placing them any higher. If he manages to be a strong proactive jungler, this team could threaten for first place, and will make playoffs even if Aphromoo remains a bottom 2 support player. If he plays like prior splits, this team will rely yet again on Froggen as their core, and I don't know that it will be enough. At their worst, this team gets 9th.

&amp;#x200B;

C9 - As I mentioned with Dignitas, the C9 org has proven that they tend to outperform the raw power of their players. However, with the roster posted from dotesports, this team fails to have a strong win condition. Fudge is an entirely unproven talent, and if he is the starting player over Licorice, I don't know where this team will seek to find success outside of one of their miracles. Maybe Zven becomes a lane dominant player and crushes bot lane. Maybe Blaber is the new prodigy and MVP. Maybe Fudge will put a pounding on every other top laner. Either way, these are nothing short of the miracles this team needs to succeed. I think that whilst Nisqy is a great player, he had demonstrated to us in Summer that his performances came from his synergy with Svenskeren and his ability to spread his presence across the map. If it turns out that Fudge is not actually the starting top laner, and Licorice is, then I suspect that this team will be much better, but until then or a weird miracle, I think that 7th is a fair ranking.  


Immortals - This is a team that I see as holding wasted talent. Xsmithie and Hakuho are exceptionally good players that simply deserve to be on better rosters, and whilst SoaZ comes off a bad run with Misfits, he has otherwise had a solid career. Their other two pieces however, they leave me screaming in a weird mixture of frustration and confusion. Eika and Altec? Really? Whilst Ry0ma leaves me wondering about his performances, I have heard a lot of positive things about his OCE performances. Eika doesn't have the same reputation however. It would be far easier, and make so much more sense to take Pobelter, who has worked with Xsmithie in multiple years and found success with Xsmithie in those years. Likewise, the synergy of Apollo and Hakuho has been replaced by Hakuho and Altec? Apollo to me has been the pinnacle of LCS consistency for the adc position. Never bad, never good. And he has played with Hakuho for years, and now they split them up so that they can have an adc that has consistently been the worst player on some otherwise good teams. The last time we saw Altec was with Echo Fox, and whilst Echo Fox performed fine with him, it came from almost completely ignoring that their bot lane existed. With Apollo and Pobelter this team would be a likely playoff contender, but as is, even though I rate the core of Xsmithie, SoaZ and Hakuho quite highly, Immortals has annoyed me with the rest of their roster.

Flyquest - have they made any meaningful upgrades? No, not really. Wadid was not a great acquisition last year, but nothing leads me to believe IgNar will be any better. Wildturtle still isn't a top 5 adc and V1per is a good role player, but not a top tier top laner. PoE is hardly what I'd call an upgrade over Pobelter either. This team will struggle to make playoffs without Santorin dragging them there like he did in Spring last year.But more than likely, Santorin will remain a mediocre jungler, despite his solo queue performances showing a lot of promise. 

Golden Guardians - This team is dragging Hauntzer's name through the mud with this roster. Whilst I like the idea of bringing in OCE talent, the idea of NA mid laners, the idea of role swapping an adc to support, I don't think it works at all with Golden Guardians. First of all, Keith's career has never shown promise outside of his stint on TL. Aside from that one split, he has consistently proven to be a bottom tier adc. He is role swapping to support, but I don't see how that will make him any better. FBI, whilst he showed some promise in some games last split, is not at a level where he can carry games yet. He is far from consistent, and needs some veteran talent to guide him to his potential. He might benefit greatly from having Aphromoo or Biofrost as his support, but with Keith, I don't know how he's supposed to develop from an adc that is strictly worse than him. Goldenglue prior to his time on C9 has been one of the worst mid laners the LCS has seen. TL put a whole year into this guy, yet both times they needed to replace him just to avoid being relegated. He was so far from being an LCS level talent, and this was despite the amount of resources and time put into developing his skill and talent. Their jungler in my opinion is a big question mark. Whilst he was a strong performer in a minor region, at best it suggests his talent levels might equal someone like Brokenblade or Ruin. That isn't bad by any means, but more than likely, he will be about as good as his adc counterpart, if not slightly better. Through all of these players, you have a Hauntzer at the end, that I suspect will be the sole reason this team is capable of winning any games. Outside of a severe misjudgement of this organization's decisions, this team has no chance of making it to playoffs, let alone making it further. I don't know why this team exists or what their purpose is.",2020-01-02 00:27:40

I guess you could consider me a Thresh one-trick since I usually only play him when I queue into normal games, but it gets annoying having to play terribly when I play other roles with friends. I have tried a lot of champions vs bots when they were free but nothing really stood out, but that doesn't mean I didn't think they were interesting. I would like suggestions for new champions for each role that I could try out. 

I am not that mechanically gifted if it helps you all decide. I have no preference of damage type, too. It would also help if the champions were on the easier side to master or be mediocre at.

# Quick recap on what we know:

Valeeva was one of the Darkin/Sunborn/Ascended of ancient Shurima, and she had a brother:

From *Twilight of the Gods*: 

&gt;""Valeeva, you and your brother saw spite in every eye, and sought vengeance for slights real and imagined.”  
&gt;  
&gt;“Oh, they were real,” she hissed, her alabaster skin threaded with violet veins and her venomous spines standing erect at her shoulders.

Note that this states that she was pale (alabaster skin). Now yes, this is her appearance as a darkin, which I don't believe she is anymore (but we'll come back to that in a moment) and could be very different from her appearance as a human, but I think it's still important. ""Le blanc"" is literally french for ""the white"" and LeBlanc is also known as ""the Pale Woman"" or ""the Pale Sorceress.""

Now this quote is also used to support the idea that Valeeva is Varus' sister because of the reference to vengeance, and the fact that Varus is looking for his sister in the story *Dark Kin*. I'm not sure if Valeeva being Varus' sister has been explicitly confirmed by Riot but we're going to just roll with this.

At the end of *Twilight of the Gods*, we have:

&gt; Ta’anari lifted a hand, seeking the touch of another living being, but no one took it.  
&gt;  
&gt;“Sulpae?” he croaked. “Is that you? Teushpa? Idri-Mi? Please, help me. I think... I think I am mortal once more, I... I think I am human again...”  
&gt;  
&gt;“You are,” said a voice that seemed on the verge of laughter.  
&gt;  
&gt;“Myisha,” whispered Ta’anari. “Are they all dead?”  
&gt;  
&gt;“No. Naganeka, Valeeva and Cebotaru escaped before the fire could take them. But they’re pretty weak, so I don’t think they’ll be a problem for long. It’s the others, all those who didn’t show up, who’ll be harder to trap.”  
&gt;  
&gt;“No! You must finish them,” wheezed Ta’anari. “Even a wounded god-warrior could conquer this world.”

So Valeeva escaped, and Myisha (Aspect of Twilight before Zoe) says she's pretty weak. And since Myisha also confirms that Ta'anari has become human again after the moonblast that reversed the Ascension, I'm going to take this to mean that Naganeka,  Valeeva, and Cebotaru are also human now. This is why Valeeva probably wouldn't have her violet veins and venomous spines anymore, but could still have her pale skin. Ta'anari also warns Myisha that ""even a wounded god-warrior could conquer this world."" And we know how ambitious LeBlanc is in that regard, forming the Black Rose with Vladimir and orchestrating all kinds of plots and schemes from the shadows with her magic. She is also possibly the ""Faceless One"" of the Noxian Trifarix, a powerful position indeed, and Noxus itself is seeking to conquer the known world.

# Extra info and speculation (skip unless interested):

It's also worth noting the first person she goes to is Vladimir, a human who uses forbidden blood magic taught to him by his former darkin master to fuel his immortality. If LeBlanc is Valeeva, it's perfectly plausible that she already knew his darkin master and possibly Vladimir himself from when she too was a darkin, and she could have retained similar darkin knowledge of magic to extend her life after she became human again. If I have my timeline right, she also doesn't go to Vladimir until the time of Mordekaiser's reign about 150-450 years after the Great Darkin War finally ends with the sealing of Varus in Ionia by the ""flaming-haired golden warrior queen"" (likely a past Aspect of the Sun) who ordered her mages to bury her alive with the darkin bow. Zoe is born within a 75 year window after LeBlanc takes down Mordekaiser, so Myisha, and probably the one of the previous Aspects of War too, probably died some time before that, possibly as the Great Darkin War was still raging. With the Aspects gone, there is no one left to hunt her or who could recognize who she once was, so she's free to come out of hiding.

Varus might not know that Valeeva is human now, especially if both of them were more concerned with fighting/hiding from the Aspects at the time, so it still makes sense for him to be looking for his sister in Shurima, in tombs and ruins that might be good places to hide a darkin weapon that he probably thinks she was sealed in. LeBlanc probably knows that Varus is looking for Valeeva but may be keeping her distance if she's unsure how he would react to the fact that she's human, especially since he seems to like killing humans.

# Moving on to visual clues:

Let's look at LeBlanc's classic splash art:

https://preview.redd.it/ik74850nv9841.jpg?width=1215&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4fb3927bf042e8f48b6188440600d7412d054d85

and Varus' classic splash art:

https://preview.redd.it/ax7pkutov9841.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=01b6cce95aaa4ea152f75795d43d4692a15f34ad

Notice anything? Besides the fact that all the gold stuff LeBlanc has (headpiece, bracers, and staff) gives off way more of a Shuriman vibe than a Noxian one, I mean. That's right, they both have a red diamond shaped gem on their forehead. Varus has another one around his neck too, but I don't have a reason for this. Then again so does Anivia, so maybe it's nothing. The pink/purple colour on Varus' heart... thing, and LeBlanc's staff might be sort of related to each other too. Similar darkin magic, perhaps? ~~Maybe LeBlanc still has those ""venemous spines"" on her shoulders, or scars from where they were - we can't really see them. And her uh... outfit is slightly reminiscent of ""violet veins""~~ but I'm definitely reaching here.

But seriously, compare LeBlanc's accessories to Azir's, Sivir's Nasus', and any of the Guardian of the Sands skins. They have a similar style complete with gems too, but those gems are all **blue** and LeBlanc's and Varus' are both **red**. Know what else is red? **DARKIN.** Big coincidence? I don't think so! ^(Just ignore Anivia please.)

# TL;DR:

Lore-wise, there are a number of reasons why it's at least plausible that LeBlanc could be Valeeva, Varus' sister, and there is an interesting similarity in their splash art, along with the fact that LeBlanc seems visually more Shuriman than Noxian, imo.

- Kennen: need to E to the enemy, put him/her in danger (or the enemy team).

I'd like to ask other league players to take some time out of any match where 2 teammates begin arguing, and tell them something along the lines of ""it's not worth it, just mute each other."" As a beginning to try and change.

 Not everyone can get along, and obviously we cant kill all of the community's anger. But if you can keep another player sane for at least one more match, it's one more shot at an enjoyable one after, and I think it's totally worth it to try. 

Let's start 2020 fresh, and give the dev team a reason to keep bringing us some awesome content for the game we've all taken a break from, yet somehow always come back to.

leagueoflegends,2020,1,"The other day I played a whole lot of league and when I went to sleep I dreamed about me playing league. You see in this dream things were not exactly as they truly are.

And there was one massive change. I was playing Darius, not sure how or what was going on but the thing is, that I bought an item that seemed to be a Trinity force, but in reality it was different, it had the hexdrinker on it, instead of the Stinger and added 10% spell vamp. Also then I popped off or something cool happened, but that's not the case.

This was just a weird concept, the thing, is it that bad of an idea to make another Triforce or a brand new item with hexdrinker on it? Because hexdrinker feels like a really powerful item in the early game, but then it just becomes so worthless that I can't even express it. In fact Maw is an item that I would never build over steraks on most champions, or if you are playing a ranged champion you would prefer Mercurial scimitar. Or maybe some adjustment to the item? I'm starting to thinkg that due to this underperformance is why these champions like Akali, Elise or Syndra seem to be more powerful and opressive than they actually are. Since games usually end at 2-3 items it's not affordable to spend 1.3K gold on an item that's not worth upgrading.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not a fan of making the same item path twice for 2 different items but I feel like it could be cool idea, maybe bring it up on some other item or a redesign. It doesn't have to be trifoce. And Hexndrinker had always been one of those items that only builds into one item just like seeker's armguard or Haunting guise (the Liandry's one), but things can always change, just like with Stinger!",2020-01-02 04:14:20

leagueoflegends,2020,1,"I am a depressed and anxious young man. I have panic attacks in which I feel I am dying; have constant paranoid thoughts that various body functions will stop working at any moment, specially at brain and heart; and have physiological effects from stress, ranging from shaking, to headaches, to being short on breath and so on. League of Legends is being an important part of my treatment, along with physical activies, healthy food habits, meds and therapy. :)

Whenever I feel like I'm in the verge of having a stroke, I start playing League as adc and tryhard as much as I can. It makes me feel safe, in the sense that if I'm able to read chat, ping my team mates, farm, position well in team fights and whatever, then I'm certainly not facing cardiovascular problems. If I'm shaking too much due anxiety, I queue as support, so I can focus on something without having to click too much. It helps A TON during the stressfull minutes that I have to wait until the medications start making effect on my body.

Playing League of Legends is also working as a great barometer for my stress-related issues. Playing normal games or aram aid me in relaxing and slowing down my tempo (on top of my ilnesses, I'm a workaholic). And playing ranked games help me check how my stress level really is: if I can in general enjoy the game, then I know I am handling my stress level well. If my eye start twitching or I feel not so well in any manner, I know I have to take some time to rest.

Watching e-sports, specially Brazilian championship, became a greatly needed hobby - as I said, it's hard to me to stop and feel chill and ease. CBLOL has been a thing on what I can ""lose"" 8 hours on the weekend just doing nothing but existing and watching the games. That helps me resetting my mindset, and gives my brain some needed rest as well.

So, yeah, I started playing long after what some people consider League's prime, but my experiences with the game so far are being great so I felt like sharing it. :) Other games probably could have the same impact, but for me League have a set of characteristics very specific for what I need and enjoy in this moment of my life, and I am very excited to see what it have to offer in 2020. Sorry about any minor grammar errors, as my english is just meh, and have a good day. ♥

IMPORTANT EDIT: Thank yall for sharing your stories, giving advice, and just interacting in general! Please keep in mind that **gaming by itself would probably NOT improve anything**.

In the comments there are a bunch of other amazing suggestions, as breathing exercises, medidation and etc. to help alleviate some symptoms. If you are facing similar issues, **don't use gaming as a mere scapism too**l! Seek for any professional help that there is on your reach.

Like what is the weakness? How has this allowed to be so overpowered for so long? If you compare this to hexdrinker (ad equivalent vs ap champs) is just a bad joke (more expensive, not even 100% gold efficient, cooldown on part of its stats).

Basically its really hard to lose lane to an ad champ if you rush this, it effectively gives you a 2 kill lead at first back, but it also builds from very cheap items (cloth armor and tomes) but it also scales into the late game by building into hourglass, its hard to keep up here...",2020-01-02 04:56:04

They reduce Vinelashers slow from 30% to 25% and make it stackable up to 50% when 2 Vinelashers are attacking the same target.

But, when you hit the snare your enemy cant move for 1 - 2 seconds based on skillpoints on E. 
A plant attacks every 1.25 seconds and applies a 2sec slow. The value a good Zyra gets from this is minor, because by the time the plant gets a 2nd rotation one plant is already killed.
If you did not lock autotargetting, you automatically attack the nearest enemy upon being snared, in this case the plant. Melee champs onehit them with one auto without playercommand. Having attackspeedboots and few level denies a 2nd 50% slowrotation as well. So what you end up getting is 5% less slow than on live as result.
Later both plants just die in snare leaving you without bonusdamage and without a slow.
Tiamat removes both plants instantly attacking one and using its active. In a simple EWWR combo both plants already die before they get empowered by ult.
Even if both plants make it to the empowered state, attacking one plant and using the tiamat kills one plant and leaves the other one at 1/3 HP in an eyeblink.

Most of the time you will just get a 25% slow and overall less damage because you arent placing a thornspitter with higher range.

I dont get what the point of the buff is anyway. There are alot of other interactions that make plants just suck as well like:
Bramblevest/Thornmail oneshots plants.
A melee autoattack.
Irelia Q/Yasuo E give them free dashes/resets, while oneshotting the plants the same time.
Ryze E, Cass E with refunds for example.
Or a single GP ultwave instantly kills an ulted plant.
Cinderhulk. Singed Q damagerefreshrate everything is so annoying.
Alot of abilities just deal way more damage than they should just because they are coded to deal AoE damage, while being multihit, dealing 4x the damage they should. Every ability at least halflifes a plant. Most mages buy ludens as well so even the dot abilities oneshot plants.

All this just for the sake that she has a ton of plants. In my opinion having less plants and giving her plants with more quality would just improve the champ overall. And the change they are doing now would make sense if needed. The plant HP just doesnt make sense since more than 2 years now.",2020-01-02 05:18:39
leagueoflegends,2020,1,"Recently (yes it's preseason but thats not a reason to try out a champ in ranked), there is alteast in every second game or lobby someone who plays a champion with zero games played on this account... and 90% of the time this person completly ints and a big factor for losing the game.   
I dont even mind the loss itself, its more that the gamequality extremly suffers from that and it just sucks.

At your friends tab create a friends folder (you just have to do this once and don't delete it).

leagueoflegends,2020,1,"Hey, folks. I play support, and recently I've been putting a lot of emphasis on dragons in S10. I set up vision for it, contest scuttle crabs, and if possible keep lane priority. I ping the dragon timer, usually at 90 seconds, 60 seconds, and 30 seconds. If I see the enemy jungler moving for it I let the team know.

But recently junglers have just been avoiding drakes like the plague! Like while the enemy jungler is solo'ing it, they're off farming some nothing camp. Even two or three drakes in they just don't seem to think they have any importance to the game at all. But apparently me asking to play around drakes makes me a toxic whiner.

So from a jungler's perspective, is there a good reason for junglers to be actively avoiding drake fights, all other things being equal?",2020-01-02 07:38:43

leagueoflegends,2020,1,"I‘ve played the game since preseason 8 now and I own close to 100 skins.
These skins probably divide in 30% Skins i wanted because I play the champ a lot (Star Guardian Syndra, Both ASol Skins), 30% Skins i got from chests / rerolls 10% skins I got simply because I think they are awesome (ig Kai‘sa) and then 30% I got simply because I play the champ and they were cheap when I had some RP left (some TF skins). 

What I noticed is, since i play... I never witnessed riot releasing skins cheaper than 1350 RP. 
While Skins get better and better and quality has it’s price. Why don‘t they at least release some 750RP or so skins again.

I get that they straight up get more money out of them and that new skins are usually very high quality. 

But what has changed. 

There are so many (old) but good skins that are 750 or so and in my opinion riot even wastes a chance of getting money through spontaneous skin purchases. What am I supposed to do when I only have 1000 RP. I don‘t want to buy chests. Why don‘t we just get some cheaper skins again. 
I can deal with my skin not having a new recall as long as there’s a new model.

How about ultimate hunter paired with cloud drakes and/or cdr. If I have 4 cloud drakes paired with a fully stacked cloud drake give 65% ult cdr. How about if you have 40cdr. Obviously you can't 105% ult cdr, so if you have a 100sec cd ultimate does ulti hunter+4clouds reduce the cooldown to 35sec and paired with 40%cdr reduce the cooldown to 35% of 60 seconds (about 20 seconds)",2020-01-02 09:51:47

leagueoflegends,2020,1,"I'm not sure if it is very prevalent in higher ELOs, but in low bronze - mid silver I've noticed nearly every other game has at-least one person who feeds heavily. I don't always think it's due to trolling or ""inting"", in fact, usually it's not. I think the problem is that most people go into ranked matches before they're ready. This could stem from overconfidence or just underestimating the difficulty of the players they will face in ranked. This dilemma can cause one to be conflicted in the post-match lobby over whether you should report someone for inting or not. I think a good solution to this would be to offer an ""Extremely Poor Play"" report option. Given enough reports the player would be banned from ranked matches for a certain amount of time. I also want to note that this option would only be available in ranked matches as a method of ""forcing"" someone to practice more in normals (If they want to play during their ban period). I also want to note that this type of report couldn't get someone's entire account banned no matter how many they received (the ranked ban period would just get progressively longer).

The reason is that these champions generally sacrifice something lategame for their early game opressiveness. They dont scale all that well unless they get fed. The problem is the likes of cassiopia, ryze and vayne going top, getting a free early game, abusing you off farm AND outscaling you. 

Im not the one to say i have the solution. its a complex issue caused by range being such an innate advantage but it realy screws with the intended power curves of these champions when they get a free early game by going top so they can scale into a hypercarry with the toplaner having no interaction to do anything about this.

Sadly, it really does look terrible, especially compared to the T-Shirt. The T-Shirt is awesome, it has vibrant colours for the print itself and the materials are nice and it's nicely cut. 

The hoodie is just thin, the zipper looks and feels fragile and the colours are so damn washed out, it looks like they printed it 5 years ago.

Here's a comparison between the two:

leagueoflegends,2020,1,"As the title says, yesterday I decided to play to get my first win of the day and some tokens, so I started in Poro King, but lost like 3 in a row.

I went to ranked flex and won, but then I was so close to get enough tokens to buy an orb that I decided to play some more.

Well, bad idea. I had the worst experience ever, I was Gold 2 97 LP and called it a night at Gold 3 40 LP.

I don't know what happened, I got tilted from the face of the Earth because it looked like a replay everytime I started a new match.

&amp;#x200B;

EVERY FUCKING TIME the enemy jungle (Lee Sin, in all 7+ matches ) would camp my lane, every time I was trying to get the mid tower, the jungle along with the support and mid would gank me, and then I kinda stopped caring, I actually KNEW I would get ganked, it was a dejavu at this point, every match played exactly the same, with a Lee Sin camping me.

Then I decided to buy Azir because why not? Activated his WK skin that I had for ages and went straight to a flex. I was against a Xerath that got like 2 kills from an early invade with my jungler afk on his own jungle (and then started pinging me because I didn't help him against a 5 man invade).

Long story short, I was like 2/18 this game, I think this is the most deaths Ive ever had in a game, Xerath was pretty much killing everyone in a single abilityl except for Nunu.

I shouldve went to sleep after that, but I didn't, and I my loss streak continued.

The last game of the night I was support, so I picked Senna, my adc was Jhin, he had mastery 7 (I think) and Jhin's legendary skin, so I thought he was good.

We got first blood, everything was going well, until he died like 4 times in a row (alone) and decided to quit.

I had a lv33 Warwick on this game with 0 ranked games on his belt, and a 2 man premade laughing about everything, one of them was playing Renekton for the first time, they didnt want to surrender.

After the enemy got like everything on the map, they pushed and we finally lost.

It was 4:30 AM and I went to sleep on a loss.

The funny thing is, I never dreamed about League of Legends as far as I remember, but this time I did, and in this nightmare I was Ziggs (?) and I was being chased the whole time, I don't know what was chasing me, but I was running, scared of being killed, I like to think that it was a Lee Sin along with his teammates, just like it happened in all games in this session.

&amp;#x200B;

[My profile](https://br.op.gg/summoner/userName=ErioI) , as you  guys can see, there is a Lee Sin in every game, and they were all mastery 7 or something.

#[EM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tw6M7V87CMY)

(repeat x1000)

**Your 2019 record:** Last year's TSM put a master class of how to fuck up a talented roster, just like America's team, the Dallas Cowboys. Regi is like the esports version of Jerry Jones, only with 1/100th the wealth, and 1/100th the managerial skill to boot. If only he was as much as a party animal as [Jerruh](https://deadspin.com/heres-a-lady-rubbing-her-face-on-jerry-joness-crotch-1616340521). 

In 2018 the *Zven/Mithy* experiment went up in flames, and TSM immediately bounced both old man Mithy and slightly-less-old man Hauntzer and went looking for some more...imports! Like any other import aside from Bjerg has worked out for them, lul. Instead of going out and getting a high-dollar Korean like Flame, or Kiin, or MaRin (just kidding), they dive into to Turkey-land and acquire ~~TF Blade~~ Broken Blade, an 18 year old prodigy. Uhh, ok. Immediately TSM fans were hailing him as their new top lane lord and saviour, shitting on anyone who [*dares*](https://www.reddit.com/r/TeamSolomid/comments/a24rjt/brokenblade_is_streaming/eav4glk/) question dear leader's actions. 

&gt;BB could int every game, going 0/5 and I'd still want him on the team. His attitude was something the team sorely missed last year. He's the glue that holds everything together. He's also a monster. Just needs to show he can match up against licorice plz

&amp;nbsp;


&gt;That random dude trash talking on hotline league, boy is that the icing on the cake. Turkish power styling on these NA noobs.

^(That wasn't me btw)

&gt;""I didn't come to NA to take part, I came to take over""

&gt;   - Broken Blade McGregor

Now freshly capped out on import slots, they sign Echo Fox's leftover support and *Grig* (who's name is totally random [btw](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/98zemn/why_doesnt_tsm_grig_use_tsm_grigne/)), and the roster is complete...until RN-Jesus demand's Grig's wrist as sacrifice. He's promptly replaced by *Akaadian*, former Optic jungler and LCS's most eligible bachelor. But this isn't *Temptation Paradise,* this is LCS, and there are no love games here (at least not until later in the season). 

Spring Split, starts out slow, until they get a style down (camp for BB, and pray) and gain top 3 regular season finish. After taking out C9 in a 5 game series, they come to St. Louis (weird flex Riot, but OK) and go up 2-0 on TL before getting reverse swept because they didn't want to spend a ban on Varus/Tahm Kench. Doublelift and CoreJJ literally carried that entire sweep on Varus/TK and not once did anyone say ""fuck it, just ban it."" [Goddamnit](https://gfycat.com/glamorousclevergrunion).

Summertime. RN-Jesus has had his fill and Grig is ready to go. Now TSM has to choose which jungler to run with, and here's where management starts to blow diarrhea all over the bed. The coaching staff immediately starts to waffle, costing the team synergy and meaningful wins. They still finish 10-8, still good enough for 4th because NA is a meme. Akaadian has some kind of fallout w/ Zven (maybe for raw-dogging his GF or something, idk) and Grig is playing like he has no hands. So Regi goes full [JERRUH](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEOnkvRMWX4) and makes the executive decision (*against Zikz's wishes btw*) to start *Spica*, talented rookie with an also questionable name. The team promptly implodes with an embarrassing 3-1 loss to Clutch in a drubbing that made even [Loco](https://www.twitch.tv/locodoco/clip/MildHorribleSandstormShadyLulu?filter=clips&amp;range=all&amp;sort=time) SMH.

Queue gauntlet. Team is still shit, nothing's been fixed, but at least they get a re-match vs Clutch for a spot at worlds. Bjergsen will carry in those high pressure moments, right? Right????? hahahNo. Next comes one of the most [embarrassing](https://i.imgur.com/KwVJxCt.png) reverse sweeps I've ever seen in League. That loss would make even the staunchest TSM fan's faith waver.

No worlds for the 2nd year in a row. What a joke. But ~~JERRUH~~ Regi will still make money, so who cares.

&amp;nbsp;

**Your Coach:** Peter Zhang, Lustboy, and ~~Plop~~ Goldman. In a way, I feel for Peter, he's not in a good spot. Working for TSM sucks, just ask their [former coach](https://i.imgur.com/xHPQrcW.png). Just like Jason Garrett, you're constantly at the mercy of the owner, and the moment things start going south, your power is usurped and the writing on the wall. TSM's coaching job has been a revolving door, much like their laundry list of junglers. Well no one else wanted the job, and it's a paycheck, so it's not all bad, right? We'll see after Week 6.

&amp;nbsp;

**What's new that sucks:** Ayyyy, the forgotten son has [returned](https://twitter.com/Dardoch/status/1197991943948517381)! After a year in Academy hell as purgatory for his starring role in TL: Breaking Point, Dardoch is back as this year's Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher. If anyone has the skill to beat back demons and make magic out of this sorry team, it's Dardoch. Big D is ""reformed"" from his TL days and has plenty of talent to work with in both solo and bot lanes. It's been lauded as a ""high upside"" move, but so was my timeshare in a condo in Minnesota, and that worked out just *great*. *Kobbe* also comes across the river after bouncing Zven for choking and trading Biofrost for not having bad Heimlich Maneuver technique. Kobbe i$ totally here to $ucceed, win LC$ and make world$, and totally not to capitalize off of making worlds to pad his 401k while his stock is the highest. Nope, no siree. Oh, and Biofrost is back. [Whoop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-FC_1zhpdk).

&amp;nbsp;

**What has always sucked:** Every year, we ask if this is the final straw that breaks the camel's back. Is Bjergsen ever going to take a stand and get the fuck out of this org? Surely this latest failure that will make him realize that the grasses might be greener on the other side! How about going to TL and making a super team? Going back to EU? Nope. Maybe it's the food, or the hunnies, or the absolute thrall he has over TSM that has him coming back, but I fear that beard man is a TSM lifer, for better or worse. I'm still confident he can rock mid lane despite having lost a step, but how well his supporting cast will do, now that's what's got everyone worried.

&amp;nbsp;

**What might not suck:** TSM drama is always fucking hilarious. Maybe someday players will realize that being on TSM isn't all it's cracked up to be and stop being punching bags and scapegoats for management and fans to shield themselves from any sort of consequences. I'd say Regi should sell the team, but he's part of the Three Amigos w/ Steve &amp; Jack, so like there's a chance in hell that'd ever happen. Can't wait for more money flinging followed by above average results in LCS followed by (if we're lucky) another 2-4 flop out in groups. Fun times for all.

&gt; Parth as a GM has been the worst thing to happen to this team. Has 0 basic common sense on how pro teams perform. He took two experienced junglers and replaced him with an academy player on the last week of LCS.
&gt; 
&gt; Like, wtf, how do you expect a better performance on very high stressful situations from a kid who has 0 experience. I dont blame Spica, I blame the moron Parth for putting him and the team in that position.

- /u/irvingtonkiller8

&gt;One of the worst parts of all this is that TSM had a really good position before, everyone wanted to play for TSM. Now they don't really have an edge on branding, no edge on infrastructure, coaching, top player interest, etc...but still you have to deal with more stress and grinding than possibly any other org in this league or others. What used to make it easy to form new rebuilds isn't there anymore, now they just have money and that's not an edge since every org has that, TL being the one who seems to flex it the most and well.

- /u/IamHongKongKid

&gt; Us fans who stick with the team season after season deserve to know why they benched akaadian a week before playoffs and 1-2 weeks after we said he was our jg. The only reason seems to be he was either mentally ill (suicidal) or fucking somebody's girlfriend on the team. ""oh he wasn't performing well"" my ass you need to be more transparent with your fucking fans year after year.
&gt; 
&gt; edit: you are a multimillion dollar corp with investors and huge standing in the industry and are putting in a new jg a week before the most important matches of the year and just saying ""oh hes played better than them in scrims"" being able to say whatever because scrims are such a good scapegoat and then having him play sej every game just to play a new champ cause we cant ban/handle the opposing team playing it when he clearly is not comfortable on it. Jesus need to act like big boys and explain to your customers why ur company is declining.

leagueoflegends,2020,1,"Hey guys, so i like this skin and i'm thinking of buying it since it's for charity and so i was looking into all the bundles and i started to notice something felt off.

So the base skin is 1350 RP wich is the normal price for an Epic skin, but then we have the emote wich is a wooping 600RP compared to the normal 350RP any other emote costs (i don't know what's so special about this emote but i personally will just not buy it). 

Then we have the bundles, the Karma border set is 2000 RP (Skin + Border icon) - so the price for the border icon is 650 RP, 100 more RP compared to the Dawnbringer Nidalee bundle, wich is the closest bundle to this one for comparison.

Next is the Chroma bundle wich is 2975RP (Skin + 5 Chromas) - 1350 from the skin leaves us with 1625RP/5 = 325RP per chroma compared to 290RP normal chromas cost.

The Dawnbringer Karma Bundle is 4575RP (Skin + Emote + 5 Chromas + 2 Icons) - 1350 + 600 + 1625 + 650 = 4225RP wich means that the simple Bundle icon is worth 350RP compared to 250RP icons normally cost.

And lastly the Dawnbringer Karma Heart Bundle is 5985RP (Skin + Emote + 5 Chromas + 2 Icons + Exclusive Ruby Chroma) - 1350 + 600 + 1625 + 1000 = 4575RP. This means that the Ruby chroma by itself is worth 1410 RP, normally if you buy a chroma bundle the eclusive Ruby chroma costs you 290RP like the other chromas. (Rito pls)

If this was a normal bundle (Skin + Emote + 6 Chromas + 2 icons) it would cost you 1350 + 350 + 1740 + 800 = 4240RP to buy it.

&amp;#x200B;

I get that this is a charity skin and that they wouldn't do the % discounts for bundles they normally do but i don't understand why you can't buy chromas separately and the difference in prices at all, imo it just drives away a lot of potential buyers and therefore more money for charity. Feel free to let me know if i missed anything or made any mistakes.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: The Dawnbringer Karma related items prices are higher than normal and i don't likey.",2020-01-02 17:12:34

leagueoflegends,2020,1,"So with Season 10 coming up in a few weeks, I wanted to share a guide on how to dodge.  I've at this point had a few hundred students over the years and its one of the biggest ways to quickly climb way more efficiently that most people don't know.  I'm a challenger level mid, am currently in GM, but was challenger just a few weeks ago.    I quickly realized that there was some terminology that's poorly understood by a lot of people that I had to explain as well for it all to make sense. The differences between LP and MMR - and evenjust the way the ranked ladder works in general seem very poorly understood.

I made a YouTube Video that summarizes the points really well I hope, but I have a few other tips to share.

The least important thing is the ""power"" of the champions people pick, usually you shouldn't worry about that at all as long as that player does play the champion.

If someone is first time on a champion, that's when you hit the panic button.

You don't lose MMR for dodging, so dodge when in doubt.

If someone is typing negative things before the game even starts, likely its a good time to find a new lobby.

If you have multiple people all from the same role, dodge the game unless they seem to know their champions from the stats.

On average I would say you should be dodging 2-3 games for every 10 you play, based on what I've seen climbing in different ranks.

Its not directly related - but please remember to take a break every 3 games whether you're winning or losing - the human body really isn't made to be sedentary for so long.

Remember with the new season coming up, we have months to get the ranks we want.  As long as you stay calm and climb over time, you'll reach your goals way more easily than trying to rush it at any point.  Make consistent gains and you'll get where you want to.  A really good rule is to say you want just 2-4 more wins than losses for every 3 days.  Don't worry about your LP, just keep increasing the MMR and your LP will follow.

I would tend to think and stuff like this is really what people don't know about the game beyond the very basics, and I hope everyone learned something.

leagueoflegends,2020,1,"What if a rune is created to solve the ranged problem?

Mages like Ryze can choose different runes for different matchups, why not give the top laners a rune against ranged?Melee only of course. To balance it out the rune could be placed in a tree that does not give much damage, focusing on getting close to the ranged champion but not outdueling a melee one.

The rune would be something like this:

For every spell or auto attack that is inflicted on you a certain amount of movespeed is given to the melee champ, scaling by how many spells/aa until reach a certain cap, similar to how conqueror stacks works. Meanwhile the attacker loses movespeed by each attack dealt when running away from the target, stacking with how many attacks he deals.

This would make wave management a viable way to counter the ranged, the rune would not be effective on mid lane since the lane is short, not viable on bot since everyone is ranged there and the rune could be put to scale horribly to not be overpowered late game, it would exist just to solve the lane problem.

leagueoflegends,2020,1,"I read this forum pretty regularly and haven't seen too much discussion on the preseason changes, so I was wondering where the community is at?

I'm a diamond support main, here's my thoughts.

Pros: 
The dragon map changes are REALLY awesome. The extra variety is subtle but definitely adds a little something extra to the game.

Dragons/souls are pretty close to being in a good spot, maybe a few more tweaks, especially to early dragons being so easy to kill. Elder is stupid overpowered though, maybe 10% execute instead of 20%? Just a full revert? Not sure.

The alcoves are also a subtle yet sometimes hilarious addition. They aren't always used but every now and then there's just a WTF YES play being made.

Cons: 
The xp changes are awful. Across the board a total failure. Top lane is still irrelevant unless they can 1v9 so nothing changed there. Mid is so insanely strong now, +3-4 levels up on jg/bot if ahead which is really unfair. Bot lane doesn't hit 6 until 10 mins if they have the audacity to die in lane to the 4 man gank. Jgs being eliminated from game off 1 death. No thanks, hard revert, let's try something new. Every game this preseason is decided at the 10 min mark, that is extremely toxic and unfun.

Herald changes, meh. The team that's ahead gets 2 instead of one. As if lane priority, objective priority, xp lead, and gold lead isn't quite enough. Maybe make 2nd Herald a nuke that hits the nexus, that can save everyone 5 mins or so!

Conqueror, keep nerfing.... or just remove it once and for all, 4-7 people should not have it every game. League of thunder lords, we back fam!

Reav3 actually said, in a thread about the roadmap, that he ""Want to throw her in the poll, to see if the communauty, want to see changes"". It's true in a certain point : even if her kit is still solid, and her visuals still hold, she's a bit off thematically speaking. Also her rework make the things even worse, and put Valor at a side character, a simple tool. I think she doesn't need huge gameplay changes, but I want her to be a real viable ADC, and not a cheese toplane pick. 
(I also want Valor to be a griffoon, but that will never happen) 
Probability : 90%

**II. The loser of last year, Dr. Mundo** 

Dispise being one of the most stupid character in the game and the ultimate stat stick champion, he end last of the poll last year. But let's be real : who actually like to play against Mundo ? He can build full tank and still deal a good amount of DPS (others Juggernaut need at least one damage item), his visual and base model had not very aged well, and he's *one of the member of the original cast.* He could be a very hilarious champ, and very fun, with a nice counter play. He is problematic, even if a Executioner Call. 
Probability : 80%

*Why I didn't include Shyvana and Nocturne* 
Shyvana with her third position on mondial classement and first in China, show us a real desire to se our half dragon having her thematic fully exploited. She is already in high consideration, for a rework and will maybe the next after Volibear. 

Nocturne, is maybe outdated, and had a not fullfilled thematic, but he's actually strong, without being OP. Yes it's because of one item, but he still had some drawbacks, and still played at all elos. So maybe Riot will give hime less priority. 


So it was the lost logical choices, so let's enter in the pure theory

**III. Corki, the most stat check ADC**

I thought about this, when I saw the futures buff for him, and the meme about the Corki and Azir meta mid. Without Trinity, Corki is practically nothing, is either too strong or too weak, very old (his base skins and legendary skins are the most hideous in game), and not viable in the bot lane. But like Mundo, he had a real potential, and doesn't need that huges changes. He can be a very fun character, a yolo Yordle, who bombard his enemies. Riot did already a good job with his mini rework, but they need to pushit further. But his gameolay still holf the ship, so I will not put him as a high priority. 
Probility : 60%

**IV. Skarner, the forgotten scorpion** 

Haaa... Skarner my beloved scorpion. I really likre him bit he need some works : he's old, his visual effects doesn't aged well, and some aspects of his kit are very odd. The Q do almost nothing, and the passive, while good is highly restrictive. I think he doesn't need that much changes, but a huge modernization would be welcome. Even this potential rework will not make him more popular, it still will help him.
Probability : 75%

**V. Udyr, the one with no spells**

Udyr is very outdated... Like all his character. the old league. His design, gameplay only around his autos, effects... He could have some real spells, instead of just differents effects on his autos. Also like the character I mentioned before, he is very stat check. Also, he can just run around the map, and doesn't have that much of a threat late game, except for splitting and soloing objectives. He can welcome a huge overhaul, even he had a 25$ visual update. 
Probability : 65% 

And you ? Who do you think is a potential candidate ? I wanted to be objective, I would be personal, Amumu, Malphite would be on this list.

leagueoflegends,2020,1,"Hi guys, my name is Moe, I'm 19, born near Chicago, Arabian parents, and I love League!   
 I main Yas / Zed / Cass across multiple seasons. My peak rank is 3 wins away from masters, Ive played across 8 different accounts this season and have over 3k games just on my main account.   
   
I know a lot of people will ask these 4 questions so I will just answer them:  
  **Do you work?:** yes, only 20 hours a week, wont say where.  
  **Do you go to school?:** No, I finished high school and didn't go to college and just wanted to play League.  
  **Why do you play so much League?:** I love winning in League, I also don't seem to have much passion / interest in anything else  
  **What are your goals for League?:** To be the best person I can be for self developmental purposes to carry in the real world in business 5-10 years from now. I am an extreme psychopathic perfectionist, I have a lot of mental problems towards failure and not improving which can also hinder improvement and screw my mental in a really bad cycle. If I cant be the best in the world in something I love, then how can I be the best in something I don't have burning passion for? Sadly, I just cant accept being mediocre and always desire improvement. Also, being the best in League will teach me coping mechanisms and the right approach to improvement instead of self destructive ones, so its something very crucial for my future.

**misc.:** I was hospitalized twice because of Solo q, genuinely believed I was going to die in both. My mom called the police on me once for my safety after an involuntary mental breakdown 2nd day in a row going 4W-16L (16 hours of sheer losing in 2 day span, 16 games = 30 mins ea per day)  in solo q towards the end of season while grinding for masters.

It would be nice to have an alternative way to earn boxes... 

Hey what about adding that to event prizes?? You already let us buy keys with the coins/orbs/whatever we earn during events. Why not let us use that event currency to buy a few boxes as well? 

This way the box aquisition rate and amount would still be kept in check and it would allow players a new way to get them. This would be great especially for people that aren't interested in the event prizes which usually focus on just a few champions (skins, borders, etc) and allow one tricks and people with small champ pools another option for getting a few boxes to enjoy with their keys.

leagueoflegends,2020,1,"The last time I played lol until two days ago was 2014. I've been trying to get back into it but this game is pissing me off now more than ever and I genuinely don't understand what I'm doing or not doing that's causing it. Let me go through a few things I've been having problems with:

**1. Itemization.** I don't understand itemization anymore. I've played some jungle nocturne, some varus and some veigar. Each time I've bought the corresponding stat item as quickly as possible, bloodthirster on the first two, spellbinder on veigar (only because from the look of it spell vamp is gone) and every single time the damage increase was laughably small. Like, I bought a bloodthirster on varus and I went from dealing 1/10th of the supports health in 5 autos to 3. Used to be you buy your AD item and people start blowing up and now it seems next to useless...

But only on me. everyone else gets one item and I get fucking two-shot. This is especially apparent on nocturne when I ult to gank a lux who is at half health, throw my spellshield up and still get combo'd to death in a split second. When I was playing varus lee sin would literally two shot me and the lifesteal from bloodthirster was so hilariously unnoticeable I may as well not have bothered.

So what's the deal, should I just be barreling for all the hybrid health/damage items or is it that penetration has gotten way better during the early game? Because even when my farm is on point and I'm two items ahead it really hasn't seemed to make much of a difference.

**2. All my old champs suck** I mean, not literally, they still work to some degree, but all my favorite champs like kogmaw, mundo and noc just feel completely outclassed. I tried to go bot with noc and ended up getting fucking mortal kombat air juggled for 2/3rds of my health by yasuo and some other generic flippy ninja weeaboo garbage champ I didn't recognize. Any time I see a new champion I just give up on ganking them because they inevitably use their two stuns and 3 dashes plus flash ignite to not only evade me but usually kill me. I feel like if I don't run high mobility high cc champs I'm basically wasting my time. I'm totally open to being wrong here but after chasing a multidashing hero from mid to top and always being out of melee range with noc I don't know what the answer to that is.

So, how do older champs adapt to this new high mobility game? Or do they?

**3. Games end so much faster** I remember getting to 6 item builds like every other game back in the day and now I rarely finish 1 + boots (given, I've played a lot of jungle and support) before one or the other team snowballs so fucking hard we either literally cant die or literally can't kill anyone. I've also noticed any time you are outnumbered you basically just back off or give up because you are going to die. One CC and I'm dead in less time than it takes me to blink. I thought DotA 2 was bad for this but compared to current league that game looks like a fucking tortoise it's so deliberate. You also seem to either get kills and get gold or get gold and still be less well off than the people getting kills. No matter how well I seem to farm when I'm in lane I can't keep up with Lee Sin when he's 4/0 off suicidal farmless ganking and I'm 1/1/6 with a ton of cs, maybe i'm not farming as well as I think I am but as a mid or adc I rarely miss minion kills.

It could just be that I'm not acclimated to the game yet, but what should I be doing to stay active and on top of things in game? 

Obviously objective timings are super important, I actually solo'd the first two dragons last game before the enemy got to them last game as jungle noc, but then we somehow threw away our massive lead and no one was getting together for teamfights so that was miserable because it felt like everyone else just gave up and I was basically playing on my own, that surrender button is some defeatist bullshit man.

So at this point I guess I'm just frustrated, I'm not really sure what I should be working on and there are so many new items and new champions (most of whom look like a bunch of generic humanoids which let me tell you is really friggin irritating when you can't tell who is doing what because they both look the same) I'm feeling pretty lost. 

I've been doing some research on items and statistics but they don't seem to really be helping so I figured I'd ask the community for their personal experience and feedback, any and all advice would be very appreciated :D

Please, this needs some nerfs.",2020-01-02 22:05:14
leagueoflegends,2020,1,"So, i really dont like the game as it currently is. I think many things are completely in cumble and have to be balanced. Tons of overloaded mechanics are in the game and a lot of skillcap was taken away (whether thats intentional or not idk)

Firstly: What are the problems im seemingly having?

1. Sustain and Damage:                                                                                                                                                                   You ever wonder why very little poke champions are being played? Sustain in the game is way too available. You have honeyfruits, drakes, runes like fleetfootwork, corrupting potion (which in combination with twt even gives bursts of healing during trades) as well as really strong sustaining items like dorans shield. These things combined and their current strengh basicly render pokechampions useless, since most of the time, there is no real reward if you cannot oneshot your oponent.                                                                                                                                           
Then there is the damage issue. Traditionally there are 3 dominant classes which all have weaknesses and strenghs. Dps counters tanks, tanks counter burst and burst counters dps (the word counter isnt really meant as in:' x can do literally nothing against y' but rather 'x has a very favorable matchup against y'). With item changes and the burst dmg in the game these things are not accurate anymore. There are way too many dps champions that can easily burst almost every nontank quite hard (aphelios, mf, cait etc). That however is not their job. Same thing applies for a few burst champs that deal a scary amount of dps and are very good against tanks even though they shouldnt be (akali). The issue with poke champions became that they, because of changes that would render them unplayable, are long range oneshotting machines in lategame, instead of poking. If you get hit by a velkoz q mid-lategame you lose way too much hp for the fact that these kinds of abilites have very little cooldown, very low manacost and very high range (velkoz was just an example that comes to my mind because of another bad 'mechanic in the game which is the overload of true dmg).       
2. The drastic reduction (in parts) of required skill:                                                                                                                                                 The issue with how dmg is applied and the loss of different dmg types (the transition towards a phase where even adcs with lots of dps have very potent burst dmg for example) makes the game way more homogen and players have to adapt way less. With every champion being bursty you really dont have to think what kind of champion benefits your position. This is perfect for onetrick ponies, which is the wrong approach for a competetive game, though. Because of items and how sustain works a lot of champions that were situational and couldnt be picked at any time, are now quite well playable into any sort of matchup. Remember old kassadin? The antimage? His theme? Him losing every lane except against a select few ap champions? Nowadays he is quite comfortably playable into literally any champion in mid since the champions that used to poke him out often dont have the tools to do so anymore due to the sustain he is able to get. His case should be an example of how bad things are since its not him that is inheritly broken but rather its the game itself that is in a terrible state.
3. The importance of certain roles in comparison to others / the required skill for certain roles and the impact they get compared to the required skill in other roles and what impact they get:                                                                                           Due to drakes being very op and mobi boots being completely broken (due to the agency they provide) jungle and support are very strong atm. And there generally isnt that much of an issue with that. Its the same problem we've had for quite a while. Supp and jungle op, mid decent, adc lacks agency and top seems to have the theme of being useless. Now how does this list sound to the amount of skill required to play every role. Mid and top are without a doubt the hardest roles to play. You need to have (for the most part/most champions) have a by far broughter set of skills required. I would argue that following these two comes adc. High-end adc is mechanically very challanging (dodging skillshots while also putting out dps and being focussed etc). But then there are jungle followed by support. You dont have to have so many basics for these roles, and the impact you can still  have is insane. The amount of gold generated by supports in particular is scary. Sure they have  unique skills they have to master but the requirements of other roles far overshadow those of these two. Requirement of skill/reward is too high on both jungle and supp. Fix adc agency and buff top in combination to overall support nerfs and jungle impact nerfs (not strenght of jungle champions, rather their influence on the game -&gt; drakes, barons, spamganking etc)
4. Autofill:                                                                                                                                                                                                       Personally i dont mind being autofill once in a while. The issue is me having to dodge nearly everytime i get jungle main autofilled or a support main autofilled onto anything that isnt botlane. This also comes down to my judgement, that you require much less skill in support and jungle and that support and jungle are (player strenght wise speaking) mostly the two worst overall players in a team. I dont know how this looks in lower mmr brackets, but once you go higher up the games are mostly decided by which team has more/ more crucial autofills and the game then is over before it started. You can argue about this all you want, but go watch a master level sololaner play support, and he will often match the enemy supports impact/influence etc. Watch a master level support player go onto a sololane and he will mostly be completly demolished. This is not an opinion, this is reality.
5. Runes and items:                                                                                                                                                                                             Mentioned some parts of this earlier. Some runetrees are just universally so much better than other (same with some keystones) its insane. Im mostly speaking about precision here. Every keystone is very strong and a lot of lesser runes are extremely strong aswell (most prominent tree for that except maybe inpsiration). Items also are very stupid often. Already mentioned my stance to mobiboots. Completely busted item. Every single player that purchases these sacrifices some walking mobility in fights (which is mostly irelevant due to every champ having 50 dashes nowadays) for crazy amounts of instant agency and impact. Same with mercs, tabis and beserkers. Every single one of them is very strong. Underwhelming on the other side are boots like sorcs (which are realisticly almost only the best option if the enemy team is completly squishy or you are massivly ahead and can finish before they get a lot of items) boots of lucidity and swiftness. Also i find items like stopwatch to be very unnecessary. I dont have an issue with zhonias and think its a balanced and good item, but stopwatch gives to many champions access to survivability they simply shouldnt have. But then there are also items like deaths dance for example that are on the brink between just good and op, depending on who takes it and in which state runes are. The last issue i have with items and runes is the fact that grievous wounds are practically useless. I think we either need a really strong nerf onto literally every form of sustain (also lifesteal/spellvamp and stuff like ravenous hunter etc you get the idea) or a buff for grievous wounds. There isnt enough awnsers for a lot of healing and especially for ap champions its very inefficient to get most of the time.

So these were the issues i have with the current game (not every single one but the ones im most pissed off by - obviously didnt mention everything). Just hope at least some of the stuff gets sorted out because over the last couple years the ever evolving stylechanges of this game have been rather worrysome (is this a word?).",2020-01-02 22:05:43

leagueoflegends,2020,1,"Hello, I was recommended to make this post here in reddit that has more visibility, people forgiveness for English (I can not speak English so I'm using google translator), I wanted to talk about the exclusive icon of Dj Sona, which can only be obtained through purchase of a product on merch riotg, which is not available in my country, I really wanted to buy any product to have the icon, but does not deliver here in Brazil. And I really love Sona, I wanted to buy but I can't why not deliver here.

I really love Sona and I don't want to be without this icon, and I sent a ticket but I was told that there is no possibility of sending any product, I'm really sad, but not only because Sona is my main, but because she is a part of me.

Thanks to the anonymity of the internet I think it's okay to talk a little about my history and why Sona is important to me.

In 2015 my life ""ended"", but unfortunately I was raped, at that time I thought a lot about killing myself, but my brother introduced me to the league, at first I didn't want to play, I didn't want to know anything, but my sister kept insisting because he thought the league would cheer me up a bit (he was right). I started playing and thanks to that I met Sona, a character who is mute and powerful, that few can understand her, and for some reason I identified with Sona, I felt that way, mute, alone (as in the lore of Sona) I felt mute it was like I had no voice anymore, I had a feeling no one could understand me somehow I imagine Sona already felt that way (even though she was a fictional character)

Sona's story is vague and says almost nothing about her, but still I still like her, silently she helped me, with her power in summoner's rift she heals her allies and in a strange way she healed a little of my pain.

&amp;#x200B;

Returning to the icon, I saw the icon yesterday (01/01) and also found that they are not delivered to the country where I live, I'm very sad that I can't have the icon, I have the money, but I can't buy it, I don't have one external home to receive the product and do not receive the icon.",2020-01-02 22:12:30

My team was losing the 4v4 at first, but I pissed off the enemy Jinx so much that she came and stayed top until it was pushed. Of course, since I was only farming I was 4-5 levels and 2 items up on her. Killed her once to send the message, then resumed my lovely afternoon with Fiora. Of course, our teammates eventually decided to ruin it, and had quite a team fight at baron where Garen killed me, but I had Guardian's so came back and killed him.

leagueoflegends,2020,1,"Hi there! This is just the average salt post - not really directed at anybody. I was just wondering why whenever someone is ""balanced"" their either gutted, or someone else or item is buffed completely. 

Maybe it's just me that doesn't understand why balance is so hard. Take Morde for instance. 

Completely busted right now except for maybe two counter picks. EASY way to fix him: cut his sustain in half, and lower (just a tad) his health/armor scaling.... Problem solved. But we all know that's not going to happen. He's going to be cut in half, or some random items will be changed making him obsolete. (I'm not a Morde fan btw, just defending him cause we ALL know his ""gutting"" is coming). 

&amp;#x200B;

WHY ... DOES... THIS ... HAPPEN....

I wouldn't think it's that difficult to make a small change to something. Anybody remember old LeBlanc with her Silence? THAT was busted. All they really did was remove her silence and boom... Balance. Maybe still did a bit too much damage, but still, brought her down to the rest of the champion pool. Still viable as an assassin, still fearsome, decent pick / ban rate, but the most important part: NOT OVER / UNDER POWERED.

&amp;#x200B;

Could you imagine if she was released in 2019? Instead of just removing the silence, they would have cut her damage in half, cut the range of her dash, lowered her health, lowered her AP scaling and doubled the price of all the items she relied on. Like wft lol. 

&amp;#x200B;

Take for instance range top lane bullies right now making the game not playable for top laners. Would REALLY be that difficult to say make melee champions take a little reduced damage from ranged auto attacks before 10 minutes in the top lane? ... I make games. I'm a programmer, and can tell you it's REALLY not that difficult. Small change, massive ""fun factor"" improvement. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now on the opposite side of things I might be the only person on the face of the earth that actually likes the support item changes. Might be a little slow on the uptake, but it saves a lot of gold in the end that the items build themselves. 

&amp;#x200B;

The whole balancing thing is really the only gripe I have with the gameplay itself these days. I still love the game, been playing for years. But it's getting a little old having to learn a completely new champion or have one of my favorites be an instant loss just because an item was changed, or ANOTHER champion was buffed / nerfed. 

&amp;#x200B;

I understand certain champions are meant to fill certain roles. I understand counter picks, lane bullies etc... But they all should have positives AND negatives. What's the negative to Kennen? Strong all game, while making any melee enemy useless all game. What's the negative to Quinn? ""oH She FaLLs off LaTe gaMe""... Does she though? Does she REALLY fall off? ... If you can nearly one shot any squishy you don't fall off... You might not have as much DPS as others, but that doesn't mean weak. 

&amp;#x200B;

Think about kayle. Terrible, terrible early game. One of the strongest late game. Now compare other ""late game"" characters like Ryze. Where's his weak point? ... Safe laning, also extreme bully of melee, will outscale nearly anybody so strong early, mid AND late game... Why is that ok? (I love Ryze, but he's a perfect example of what I'm talking about).

My ideas how to improve it:

* let us decide on our own what do we wanna put in each role;
* let us remove champions from the role tags;
* LET US DO IT OUTSIDE CHAMPSELECT;

The latter is most important as the only time we can do it is during champselect but UP TO THE MOMENT we pick our champion. This is most ridiculous part of this system.

Middle one's gotta be self explanatory. If champions can be removed by low playrate (like Karthus mid) why can't players themselves remove champions they won't ever play, e.g. The Super Top velkoz?

First be last, it's functions same as middle dot, added both so one wont need to build a champion pool from scratch. Don't need to add the general list won't be touched at all so you can pick any champion if needed.",2020-01-03 00:11:20

leagueoflegends,2020,1,"Seriously, can we just like, start having an actual system to prevent that?
At the very least not even being able to ban a champ hovered by a teammate? Believe me, I hate when my last pick teammate hovers Yasuo when 7 guys pick before him, but I just let out a sigh and ban anything else since he intends to play him.

Just what kind of jerk starts pissing his team off in champ select? Like for real, I don't even understand the point of it.
You don't like your teammate playing Darius top or Sivir adc so you ban them? Well, congratulations, that person is now pissed off and will either troll your game, start the game tilted, thus playing badly or just playing the game suboptimally cause the bad ambient generated from that shit.

I've been having A LOT of people like this in the team. 90% of them do it on purpose, like you hovered the champ, they had 20 seconds to see it hovered, then they directly ban it.
After that it's always the same damn sentence ''Oh sorry''.
Casually, the guy usually has a premade who also happened to ban another teammate's champ, so 2 targeted ally bans, and, by pure coincidence, they both say ''Oh, sorry''.

The worst part is that the majority of time it happens when I want to play something normal, not even ''not-likable'' champs. It's been happening to me a lot with champs like Darius, Ezreal, Caitlyn, Lux... etc.
Some time ago it happened to me almost every game with Yuumi, but it had some kind of explanation since people thought she was trash, but come on... Even if someone wants to pick a weak champ, it's not ranked, Jesus Christ, why do you ban it?

I don't know, I don't really consider it fair having to wait 5-15 minutes just because some spoiled kid wants to troll you and you have to either dodge or spend the entire game uncomfortable knowing that that guy trolled you, nothing happened to him and nothing will happen because you can't report someone for that.

leagueoflegends,2020,1,"I was the jungler on my team. I just played against a Jhin/Yuumi double smite funnel comp where they ran around farming both mid and jungle. The Yuumi out-leveled me even though she was getting zero exp from monsters (Jhin got all the monsters) because the catch-up exp from being afk attached to Jhin in mid-lane allowed her to.  
  
Also Jhin had the monster hunter debuff for a large period of time. Didn't matter. He wasn't getting gold, but he was getting levels, and was still able to kill people before completing his jungle item.  
  
Riot has designed the jungle so badly this season that a support can follow the jungler around, not get any exp from monsters, and then still out-level the opposing team's jungler by getting catch-up exp every time they go to farm mid. And since it was Yuumi, you can't actually punish her cuz she's untargetable while she's catching up.  
  
This is what happens when Riot puts band-aids on things instead of actually designing them properly. I didn't just get beat by something that's not supposed to work. It actually seemed more optimal than the meta. Because jungle exp is so low now that the funnel support out-leveled me. At least last season with Taric/Yi or Nunu/Karthus the support would actually be under-leveled and killable. That is no longer the case.  
  
tl;dr - lanes giving catch up exp and jungle monsters NOT giving catch up exp has broken the game, and this is proof of it.  
  
Anyone experience anything similar? This is the first time I actually want to quit the jungle for real. Out of all the seasons I have played (I started season 3), this is actually the worst. I just had a support become more powerful than me since she had catch-up mechanics to benefit from, and I didn't.",2020-01-03 03:36:19

leagueoflegends,2020,1,"Top Lane:

There is a ton of talk with Top Lane currently. The issue with Top is that Tanks just aren’t good enough. Either Tank items get buffed or more tank items are added into the game. 

The reason why this is an issue is because if tanks are bad then everyone just plays carries Top. If carries are played Top it becomes who picks the better carry. 

Top lane is pretty much a Rock Paper Scissors lane currently. Tanks beat Ranged Carries, Ranged Carries beat Bruisers and Bruisers beat Tanks. Bruisers have been kicked out since Tanks are worthless. There is too much emphasis on the champion picked rather than the actual skill of the player.

Jungle:

Jungle has been horrible for two years now. The problem with Jungle is the role is so terrible that Junglers are essentially useless. If Junglers remain weak they have no option but to spam gank since trying to get strong on their own is worthless. This is also bad because Jungle champions lately have been getting buffed a lot making the champions all huge snow ballers. 

The EXP changes also removed any opportunity for Jungle to be a 1v9 role. You cannot gank to bring your team back into the game. If your teammates are feeding ganking for them will just make you lose quicker since all the enemy Jungler has to do is focus on farming and just win via EXP lead. 

Matchmaking:

Not much has to be said about this. Matchmaking in this game is not balanced. I think people have noticed that you go on win streaks followed by lose streaks nowadays.

It feels as if the game sometimes forces you to lose. Fix matchmaking and make it balanced no player deserves to have their time wasted.",2020-01-03 04:51:17

leagueoflegends,2020,1,"Hey there!  
I'm kinda new on this Reddit thing and English is not my native language, so I apologize the poor grammar and the misspellings.

I'm currently on d3, 0 LP, just reach it on preseason, but I've got some issues...I'll explain them below:  


• I play since middle of Season 3, but I never had a ''main'' lane/role. I just used to play whatever I was in the mood to play. And that gave me some nice basic knowledge of all the lanes, but It got me frustrated now because I'm not a very good player on the lane I want to play, which is MID. I mean, I use to play Mid/Jungle when Soloq, but I feel like I don't have enough skills/knowledge to carry the game properly as a MAIN should do (I don't want to carry 100% of the games, I just want to feel that I have done the right thing to contribute as a ''main x lane'').  


• I used to play on some female teams and since female scenario is popping up around here people ''know'' me as a ''''pro player'''' and so, many people say ''wow, you're that player from X team, right? You're awesome!'' but I don't feel like that because of my low elo. Besides I didn't got into any tier 1 tournament or stuff like that, at least yet. (Last year, girls had an exclusive big tournament that would lead the best female teams worldwide to play the finals in Dubai, and I got hyped to play, but I didn't have a team).  
I don't want to take any advantage of being a girl, I just want to play in a scenario that grants girls the right visibility and respect they deserve. (I'm not into any teams atm, and I don't mind playing on a team with boys or without any girls if it's necessary).  
Once people know me, I'd like to encourage and inspire the girls to play wherever they want to but, once again, my low elo makes me feel ''I can't represent or inspire anybody with this shitty elo...''  
Also, I'd like to reach a nice elo and be able to compete decently.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: I want some advices and stuff to improve my gameplay, which will consequently improve my elo, so I can get into a nice team and I'll also be able to represent and inspire more girls to play wherever they want to play, because most people around here are very aggressive and mean with them.

  
I hope we can have a nice discussion/advices in the post!

leagueoflegends,2020,1,"Or else they just go top lane and do lame stuff.

Melee top laners *really* don’t like playing into ranged, and as far as I can tell, its the combination of ranged, consistent damage with an at least decent early game that allows a champion to become a viable ranged top laner.

It seems to me that if a ranged character is gated by cooldowns (control mages and artillery mages) or just isn’t self sufficient enough early (most of the ADCs), they aren’t a viable top laner and thus don’t contribute to the ranged top laner problem.

At least, that’s what I think is happening but I’m honestly not 100% sure.

Edit: I did not mean that ranged DPS champions need to be weak*er* early. I was just observing that as a general rule, ranged DPS champions shouldn’t be strong and self sufficient early. For the most part I think that currently holds true.",2020-01-03 06:06:29

Q: Stonus slams the ground in front on him, dealing magic damage in a wide line in front of him that slows enemies hit by it. Enemies that are taunted are knocked up instead of slowed.

W: Stonus heals himself and the nearest ally champion. (I honestly couldn't think of a better W. I'm open to ideas for a different W.)

Active - Stonus dashes forward a short distance, then slams the ground, causing a seismic ripple to extend out. Enemies hit by the ripple take magic damage based on a flat amount + his bonus Armor and MR. Enemies hit by the ripple are also taunted after .5 seconds.

Because I can take a Leona standing behind me in bot lane for so long before I tell her to step the fck up. But that is punishable behavior, so now if someone plays like a degenerate I go afk. This is not an infrequent event in any way. I wish that when my mid laner is a full minute late to scuttle fight, we could just flame him for having the eyesight of a bat.

leagueoflegends,2020,1,"Not about the game; the new items, drakes, rift herald, champions, and reworks are all amazing. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm disappointed by the spite and vitriol pervasive in practically every game. Every mistake is pinged. Someone is blamed for every loss. Every bad gank is attributed to some imagined disability of someone else.

&amp;#x200B;

 I don't know if it's rose-tinted glasses or some latent boomer inside me, but I swear this community used to be better. Maybe its the new lingo, like ""\_\_\_ diff"", ""next game"", or ""dog \_\_\_"" that everyone loves to use or if it's something about 'pre-season' (whatever that is) that means people care less about games. Whatever it is, it just seems like people no longer enjoy the game, play for fun, or have any sense of camaraderie with their teammates. Everyone is an enemy to be attacked by either right-clicking or typing.

&amp;#x200B;

The result of this meta of hatred seems to be mutual depression and antisocial behaviour. The game seems less about teaming up to destroy the enemy nexus than playing your own mini-game and lashing out at anything incompatible with your game plan and giving up. I desperately want to believe that my teammates are better people when away from a keyboard, yet this toxicity is on every form of the game's media and endlessly practiced by  streamers, thus I fail to see how something so ingrained in League's culture doesn't have some effect. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know the solution to this. Perhaps harsher penalties, greater rewards for being kinder, or some fundamental changes beyond these. Either way, I will be putting down this game again, perhaps returning in a few years to see if things have changed. Until then, I hope you all focus on the positive experiences you have with this game and try to enjoy the fleeting time you spend in League.",2020-01-03 07:26:49

leagueoflegends,2020,1,Throwback to when me and my Flex Queue team got matched up against CLG (We won),2020-01-03 12:01:41
leagueoflegends,2020,1,"Having played league since Season 4, by now I own a skin for everyone champ I enjoy playing. In the past I would buy all the skins for a champion I liked playing, but these days I prefer to just own one nice skin for each champion. I basically don't spend money on League of Legends anymore, I haven't bought an event pass, and I get all my new skins and champions through crafting. Despite the fact I play the game almost daily Riot doesn't make a penny off of me anymore. Now I'm perfectly okay with that (obviously, who doesn't like keeping their money), but just because there isn't anything I want to pay for right now doesn't mean there couldn't be in the future.

Things that I would almost certainly buy without hesitation:

1. Map Skins. Seriously how many games of league staring at the exact same map have we all played. Yes the map changes a lot this season with the addition of the elements but those changes are completely outside of player control and the changes only take roughly halfway into the average game.

Skins that are Hextech themed, Piltover themed, Zaun themed, Noxian themed etc. Would be dope and would be for sure money makers.

2. Announcer Voice Packs. Let us buy announcer Voice Packs. This isn't even a foreign concept to Riot. These have literally already been in the game. I would pay money for the Gangplank announcer pack, or the Sjokz/Quickshot announcer pack if it came out tomorrow.

There's probably more things apart from skins that I would pay for,I can't think of them, but I'm sure there are talented people at Riot who will have idea. All I know is there's very little chance I buy another skin or an event pass anytime soon. So if Riot wants my money they better up their game on the in-game cosmetics.",2020-01-03 12:04:52

Nowadays the latter summ spells are gone, so they could get replaced by Exhaust and maybe trinket CD reduction.   They could add  heal and shield power, otherwise.

The best thing about the item is that it dissapeared from your inventory and became a permanent buff after you gained 3 levels.  

Champions like Yuumi and maybe Taric could use such a cheao option that lets them enhace their  mana regen without occupying inventory space of more important components.

Dr.Zaroff The nefarious doctor

Passive:

Surgeons Steady Hand: Dr.Zaroff's Auto attacks cannot be Dodged or Stopped (Eg: I start my auto then annie zhonyas if i started my auto it will still deal damage or if an enemy walk out of vision after the auto starts it will continue to go off) unless zaroff cancels the auto himself.

Infected Scalpel: Dr.Zaroff's autos can not critically strike instead he has a 25%+(X(crit chance)) chance to infect the enemy with an auto attack dealing 15/45/85/100 (level 1,6,11,16) over 2 seconds This effect is stackable up to 4 and resets the timer.

Doctors Order Q: Dr.Zaroff Pulls out a syringe and stabs an enemy (targets champions first) with it dealing 80/115/155/200/235 + (X(85% of ad)) and  reduces healing to enemies hit by 15% (the skill-shot would be like a pyke q when not held or yasuo q)

Super Pill W: Dr.Zaroff takes a pill gaining 50/100/150/175/200+(15% bonus hp) over 2 seconds if the heal would overheal Zaroff he gains a shield for the amount over for 2 seconds

E: Dr.Zaroff leaps to the target and applies a stack of Infected Scalpel zaroff gains 15% MS for 3 seconds  if he leaps to a champion

DNR  (Do Not Resuscitate) R: Dr.Zaroff empowers himself giving him 15/25/35+2(x(Total Takedowns))/3(x)/5(x) ad and increases his health by 50/75/100+2(x)/3(x)5(x) and makes his autos apply onhit affects to all enemies near him removing the cap of stacks on Infected Scalpel

leagueoflegends,2020,1,"So, i am new to League of Legends, about a mouth. I have played Dota 2 since 2015 and i have adapted quite well to the Lol mechanics but still i have some questions that are bugging me.

1. Why are there so many OP heroes? Like Master Yi that made me cry in chat like a lunatic or Yasuo or many more. Isn't there items or a build that can counter them? Everytime i encounter them my team and i die in seconds. It's too OP!! And i know i shouldn't do this but i compare it to Dota. In Dota, there is always a counter to a hero (another hero, a specific item, something). In lol, if that specific hero gets farmed it's over! That's not cool and it's fun killing.

2. Why are the teams soooooo unbalanced? Many times i've been put in team with players that are lvl 20 or so (i am 24) and the enemy team were level 100 or even 150... How is that fair?? I am not saying that Dota matchmaking is golden... But it's still better in my opinion.

leagueoflegends,2020,1,"Hi everyone, after a few years of playing ranked I've realized that the system is broken. Reasons why:

&amp;#x200B;

* Riot hides MMR.
* Tier system is unnecessary given that MMR is what represents your skill.
* Promos require you to have a 66% WR (arguably 75% WR) against people who you should have a 50% WR against (you get matched with people with the same MMR as you).
* If you lose promos you get placed at 75 LP whilst if you win you get placed at 0 LP.

I'll describe a scenario to illustrate how the current system is unfair. I think we can agree that a random player has on average 20% influence on the outcome of a game given that there are 4 other people on their team. Let's say a player decides to play 5 ranked games. They win 2 of them and lose 3. The order in which this occurs is slightly significant because MMR changes will affect the difficulty of the matches. (For example if the player wins 2 then the next matches will be slightly harder.) However the order in which these wins and losses occur should have very little effect on the player's league placement given that a player only has 20% influence in a match. If this player is at 0LP and loses 3 matches, they will most likely be demoted. They then win 2 matches and get placed into promos. So they are 2 wins away from where they started. Instead, if the player wins 2 matches they will get placed at 40 LP, assuming they gain 20 LP per match. They then proceed to lose 3 and get placed at 0 LP, approximately 2 losses away from demotion. So in conclusion, the order of the wins and losses has a huge impact on the player's tier placement. Luck plays a very signficant role in promos. In this case the difference is 2 wins (about 40 LP). As I mentioned earlier, the order of the wins and losses is relevant to some degree due to MMR changes, however due to the fact that the player only has 20% influence, a difference of 40 LP is way too much. An amount like 5 LP would be appropriate.

I believe Riot said that they introduced promos in order to make ranked queue feel like a tournament best of 3 or 5. The difference is that in a tournament you are playing with and against the same people. Also, in a tournament you play and get graded as a team, not as a single player. This makes sense given that a player only has 20% influence.

Here I will explain how I believe Riot has designed this system to get people to play more. At the start of a season, players are placed into a rank which does not show their skill, thus players will dislike it. This rank is visible on their profile so they are very motivated to improve it. In a typical ELO ranking system, it would take maybe 30 matches to get an accurate representation of your skill. This applies to MMR as well, which Riot uses to match you with people. After 30 matches you get matched with people with the same MMR, however you do not get matched with people in the same tier/division. If people could see their MMR then they would ignore the tier system given that it is very inaccurate due to the luck required to win promos, as well as other factors. The fact that you are matched with people with the same MMR, but not in the same tier/division, forces people to grind for hundreds of games in order to reach the tier which accurately represents their skill. And remember that none of this grind is actually necessary, given that MMR accurately displays your skill, and Riot already knows what your MMR is.

So what is the solution to avoid this useless grind? In my opinion, it is to not play ranked at all. This way you will simply be unranked instead of being significantly below your accurate tier and feeling compelled to grind. Note how once you've done your placement matches there's no way of hiding your rank from your profile, it's specifically designed to motivate you to play more ranked games. If enough people stop playing ranked then Riot will be motivated to reverse the tier system and go back to the MMR system from S1 and S2.

Hope this post will have some impact, good luck everyone",2020-01-03 13:32:39

leagueoflegends,2020,1,"For a long time now AP bruisers have played a transitional role between tank, mage and assassin. That’s fine, except you don’t pick an AP bruiser because you want a bruiser, they're picked because they build the same items and do better than their tank/mage/assassin alternatives, until they get nerfed for abusing it. Their core problem is their itemisation, and while Riot (Meddler?) did some investigation earlier in the year, nothing has come of it (yet). This was yet another unsuccessful attempt, one of many over the past 10 years.

So let's identify the real problem together so we can create a solution.

Examine for a moment with me the itemisation of their physical counterparts:

&amp;#x200B;

|Class|AD|AS|Crit/On-Hit|AP|CDR|Lethality|Penetration|Defensive|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Marksman|✓|✓|✓||||✓||
|AD Bruiser|✓||||✓||✓|✓|
|AD Assassin|✓||||✓|✓|✓||
|AD Tank/Juggernaut|✓|||✓||||✓|
|Mage||||✓|✓||✓|✓|
|AP Assassin||||✓|✓||✓|✓|
|AP Bruiser||||✓|✓||✓|✓|
|AP Tank/Juggernaut||||✓|✓|||✓|

What do we notice? Every class of AD champion has a unique combination of stats they wish to build from itemization. Marksman differ from Bruisers or Assassins in that they prioritize attack speed, building into crit or on-hit effects. Assassins remain unique from bruisers by prioritising lethality and AD far more than supplementary defensive stats. Physical Tanks/Juggernauts will generally avoid that penetration in favour of defensive itemisation. Even supports, with their recent changes, have AD &amp; AP targeted itemisation to suit specific playstyles.

Yet with AP champions this is not the case. Mages, bruisers, tanks and assassins all want the same core of AP and CDR, and none feel particularly opposed to collecting the supplementary defensive stats attached to a Banshee's veil, Zhonyas, or RoA. In fact, they value it higher than raw AP from a Deathcap. Perhaps the only notable difference is assassins prioritizing flat penetration early in their build, mages tend to get percentage penetration later, and tanks avoid it altogether.

What’s the conclusion? AP champions, particularly bruisers, do not have a unique itemization set tailored toward their role. And the result? They have been traditionally hard to balance, used alternatingly between assassin or tank depending on the balance of itemisation and the meta at the time.

For example, Sylas &amp; Mordekaiser have been cemented into the AP Bruiser role because of so much utility built into their ktt, and they've been abused and nerfed when they're played any other way. Yet they need this utility because it isn't provided by itemization. Others who could be identified (e.g. Swain, Singed, Rumble, Gragas, Diana - especially after rework) don't have this utility inbuilt, or access to it through itemisation, and get stuck as a glass-cannon AP assassin/mage reliant on Zhonyas for survivability, or build full tank.

True AP bruisers don’t exist because they don't have a unique identity, and consequently there isn’t the tailored itemization to support their role.

What’s the solution? Two fold. First, add/create a new stat (or passive) targeted at AP bruisers, and update itemisation accordingly. Second, reduce (but not eliminate) bruiser’s dependence on AP and increase dependence on new stat. Finally, we need to ensure that there is still the rock-paper-scissors scenario when choosing AP Assassin/Bruiser/Mage; one class can’t just be a more damaging or tankier version of another, we need those differences in mid/late game power spikes and roles preserved.

Has this been done before? Yep. The Assassin update transitioned assassin scaling into dependence upon Lethality, without removing the other things they want. Lethality remains largely exclusive to their class. Supports have a lot of utility passives in their targeted itemisation (for example Redemption’s +10% increased heal &amp; shield power), but also have utility scaling with AP on their abilities (e.g. the speed boost on Nami’s UP Surging Tides and slow on her E Tidecaller’s Blessing both increase with AP), or defensive scaling from bonus A/MR (Leona, Braum).

So, to propose some options:

**Option 1: Scaling from Mana**

Goal: Identify AP bruisers with % Max Mana scaling on abilities.

Simple. Similar to Ryze, we give AP Bruisers reduced AP ratios (e.g. 45% instead of 70%) but compensate that with damage or defensive scaling mana ratios (+5% max mana). This should only need to be added to 1-2 key abilities per champion to have an impact.

E.G. Defensively, Sylas could have his shield on E1 changed from 220(+100% AP) at rank 5 to 220(+60% AP; +5% max mana). Or offensively, damage on Q changed from 145(+60% AP) at rank 5 to 145(+40% AP; +3% max mana).

These changes will cause AP bruisers to prioritize items that give mana, even with lower amounts of AP, or none at all.

With offensive mana scaling, AP Bruisers may become late game terrors like Ryze currently is, though perhaps not as bad if it is only on a single ability. Defensive scaling is a way to make them bulkier without the consequences of a huge shield from AP scaling that a glasscannon build provides shields (getting tankier from raw damage is just oppressive).

Pros:

* Mana as a stat/item already exists in game
* Mana items that give defensive stats are already available (e.g. Frozen Heart, Abyssal Mask), and so are offensive ones (e.g. RoA, Seraphs, Hextech GLP-800) so minimal itemization changes would be needed.
* The combination of AP-based offensive scaling with Mana-based defensive scaling would mean glass-cannon AP Bruisers don't get bonus tanky stats, and Mana builders don't get free damage.

Cons:

* Removes Ryze’s uniqueness as the mana scaling mage.
* Some AP Bruisers (Vlad, Morde, Rumble) don’t use mana.
* RoA/Seraphs would become staple items, Ludens/Hextech are already built by a lot of Mages/Assassins. It isn't necessarily the uniqueness or exclusivity we are seeking.
* Reduces the damage falloff of AP Bruisers, and delays mid-game spike to more of a late-game power spike, where they would compete with traditional mages.

**Option 2: Base Damage Amplification as Item Passives**

Goal: Identify AP bruisers with high base damage, low AP abilities, with further bonus damage per level.

Here, we increase the base damage of AP Bruisers basic abilities while reducing their AP ratios, and introduce an itemization line with percentage base-damage amplification.

Morde is our example here. While rank 5 Q has a comparatively low 155 base damage, it has a bonus 5-139 base damage based on level, with a 60% AP ratio. Adding this per-level bonus damage scaling to 1-2 key abilities per champion, while compensating with a 20-25% reduced AP ratio, will reduce their dependence upon AP without hurting their effectiveness.

Items such as Rylais, Liandry’s, Protobelt-01, and perhaps 1-2 new items (built from Seeker’s Armguard or Chalice) gain a passive which gives 10-20% base (or bonus per level) damage amplification. Think similar to what Abyssal Mask provides (nearby champions take 15% increased magic damage), without the Aura and it won’t stack multiplicatively with AP. Such items would only need a moderate amount of AP (40-50) when completed, as there is additional damage power from the passive.

For example, a typical rank 5 ability would deal 250 (+70% AP) magic damage. For bruisers, this should be modified to 200 (+0-150 based on lv; +45%AP). This is even damage at level 18 with 400 AP.

At level 12, your 10% bonus base damage from itemisation takes this from 200(+100lv, +45%AP) to 220(+110lv, +45%AP) for a total of 330(+45% AP) damage. Or, your 20% bonus per level damage goes from 200(+100lv, +45%AP) to 200(+120lv, +45%AP) for a total of 320(+45%AP) damage.

Such items become a great pickup for AP bruisers with high base damage (with bonus per level scaling) and low AP ratios, but suboptimal choice for Assassins or Mages with lower base damage and higher AP ratios.

Pros:

* Available to all AP Bruisers
* Creates the exclusive/tailored itemization sets better than Mana. Less chance of the new items being abused by other classes.

Cons:

* Pushes AP Bruisers towards a solo-lane or jungle role, where they can obtain the additional experience for bonus levels. However, this is where they (and their AD counterparts) are traditionally played anyway.
* Could potentially involve re-evaluating AP ratios &amp; base damages of nearly every AP Mage/Assassin/Bruiser in the game.

These are just two suggestions, but short of adding a new stat into the game, I see no way to create the exclusivity this line of itemisation requires. AP bruisers don't have much in common with each other, let alone that which is unique from Assassins or Mages. Neither DoT, Shields, Heals, AoE, Magic Damage Auto Attacks's, or Mana can be said to be the core identity of an AP Bruiser. That's not to say other ideas don't exist, but the key requirement is making these items tailored and unique to AP bruisers to prevent abuse.

I want to say that the aim of this is not to remove the uniqueness of specific champions and force them into a role. Azir is an AS mage and should stay that way. Kai’sa is a marksman who loves AP. These unique play styles and item paths are healthy for the game. The aim is to provide a unique set of itemization for a specific class of champion that doesn’t have it yet. With these changes, AP Bruisers can still build full tank or glasscannon AP, albeit sub-optimally unless the situation demands it. But Mages and Assassin’s can’t take advantage of the defensive stats of bruiser itemisation without having reduced damage output.

**Tl;dr**: Every champion class in the game has a unique stat combination provided by itemization, except for AP bruisers. They overlap significantly with AP Assassins and Mages, and suffer identity crisis because of it. Something should be done to promote a unique AP Bruiser itemization path to differentiate them as a class, one that Tanks, Mages and Assassins can’t easily exploit.",2020-01-03 13:42:01

leagueoflegends,2020,1,"Is that only a handful of junglers can utilize them. Majority of the junglers do not clear fast enough and cant sequence ganks to get some kind of efficiency out of them. Champions that clear fast (e.g. karthus, olaf and graves) can use it to an extent, however if you are someone who does not clear as fast as them, you are basically missing out on experience, as individual camps give less experience. This leads to an unhealthy jungle difference created by lane difference. Initially, I was not against the changes, but in practice it just simply is not fun to play against, when you have champions like olaf running you down when they are 2-3 levels ahead solely because they can clear super fast and get a couple of free ganks off due the neglect of the minimap.

The game now just feels like the feral flare meta again, but without having a super buff off the item. Afk farming and praying your teammates dont feed just to stay within a reasonable level gap compared to others is not really 'fun', and why are we playing video games if we are not having fun.

leagueoflegends,2020,1,"I main support, I'm not a very good player, mechanically average and don't take ranked too seriously. I'm in mid plat right now after a long break and starting to play ranked a couple of weeks ago.

I'm noticing a lot of people in ranked just have terrible game sense, they have no clue where they should go or what they should do once laning phase is over.

Now I'm not even talking about the adc getting caught in the jungle at 40 min and costing us baron, I'm talking about just every once in a while looking at the map and thinking ""mhm what should we be doing"".

Like if we take mid inhibitor, 90% of the time everyone will just default back to mid, but that's not very smart. We can go bot while mid is auto-pushing, we can go baron to force them to contest it, we can send a split-pusher top while the rest push bot, or 50 different things.

Honestly it doesn't even matter WHAT you do, as long as you gave it a second of thought and your team is on the same page.

I'm not expecting people to make the best decisions and I don't even mind that people get caught, hell I do it too, I just wish people tried to understand what's going on, read the map, and use their heads more.

This is the biggest thing that separates players, honestly it doesn't matter how much of a mechanical god you are, if you don't use your head and try to read the game, then your games will be inconsistent and you will be stuck.",2020-01-03 14:26:25

leagueoflegends,2020,1,"Once in a while when I'm playing I don't do so well in game. For example: I don't know how to play Lee Sin properly in game and I want to practice him in draft. I miss a lot of q's and my fighting isn't perfect either but I'm trying my best. At least haven't fed many kills, maybe a few. Trying to keep myself together and be motivated to play better.

But suddenly my team notices me for doing some shit plays! They call me out for it. They spam ping ""?"" on me and say ""wtf are you doing, stop helping me"".

In slight tilt I type ""say no more fam"" and continue with my hustle. I go to gank top lane but it seems like I am 3 levels behind and out top laner isn't doing so well either.

Only option is to farm or gank bot. They are asking for help. I rush in and fortunately I helped them get a kill. I feel good.

But suddenly enemy jungler secures the infernal drake and my team is not happy about it. After time passes their tilt starts rolling up as well and they lash out at me saying ""stop inting, you lost us the game"". I respond with ""why report me for inting when I'm trying my best, you have no reason to report me"". And after that they always say ""gg rep jg"".

It's just sad that trying my best and keeping somewhat calm isn't helping at all because my team is flipping out when the situation isn't even that bad. Nobody thinks that ""maybe he's having a bad game"" or ""he looks new to the champ, maybe I should give him some advice"". All they think about is why and how we are losing, then framing the one who's guilty as an inter.

My story is about the ban I received on the 3rd of January, 2020.  
I was playing ranked, and then I noticed that no one was taking the game seriously, which is understandable, so I didn't take it serious either. Next thing I know, I was getting flamed for trolling. My teammate, Kha'Zix said that he would ?write a ticket to riot?, which I didn't understand because I wasn't even trolling, as I said, I just didn't take it serious.  
I queue up for the next game with the enemy Zed, who completely agreed with me, and said that I was the most useful in the team. Then, what I see just shocked me. I got banned for 'Extremely inflammatory and offensive in-game comms"", like what?? Im not a flaming person, sometimes I tilt but then I just /muteall and play the game.  


In Game 2, I was flaming my teammates for fun while we were playing normals, but Riot can't know that, what can I do about that one? My friends and I already wrote tickets to Riot Support, but they haven't responded, and I don't think they will either.  


In my opinion, this ban is really undeserved, and I'd like to do something about it, if it's possible, since I've spent so much time and money on this game, it's unbelievable. I've been toxic in the past, but I stopped flaming entirely, to stop THIS from happening..",2020-01-03 15:07:15

As you can see (yes I play Teemo) I might have gotten an S at the end of my last game and would have gotten a mastery token and a chest, but no, nothing.

I noticed this tends to happen for a while, as you can see (in the image attached to the post), it's been 3 games, and isn't an individual game thing.

leagueoflegends,2020,1,"Hi.

I am an EUW player since S3 when I was silver and in later seasons gold. Today after tryhard for a couple of weeks I have finally reached platinum.  I needed three promo series to finally get it. It means a lot to me since I have tried seasons before but was never quite able to reach it. I was always just stuck in gold 1 or 2 and eventually, I just gave up and play ARAM or some other games.  After I won I've deleted league and don't know if I will be coming back since this grinding was quite challenging and I already behind in my studies right now. 

OP GG:  [https://euw.op.gg/summoner/userName=new%20nose](https://euw.op.gg/summoner/userName=new%20nose). Any comments/thoughts on it are very appreciated. I am still trying to figure out how I would perform better, climb faster.

I would also like to post some tips for climbing from gold to platinum for all the junglers:

\- Always ban just one hero. For me, it was Twitch. What I do not like about it is that he brings the jungle to lanes and I feel useless since I play the slower champions.

\-Only play a couple of heroes. I was best with Zac (60% WR), Nocturne and Yi. Yi was tricky one since by the ending of the climb I started to ban him if I was in the first or second rotation since the enemy can pick it and I can not counter pick it. 

\-Keep your head clear. Take deep breaths. No matter how bad your teammates seem to be, the enemy team is almost always on the same level. It's winnable!

\-Checking live game player stats and match history does not really matter. What matters is the game right now and only your performance. 

This is also an AMA if anybody is interested in it :). 

Thanks for reading throughout, I will be checking thread in an hour or so if there is any interest. I will still stay a huge league follower and supporter. I cannot wait for the new season of LEC to start.",2020-01-03 16:01:18

But then I started to wonder.

Ever since the announcement of two new games--Ruined King and Conv/rgence--I wonder if they mirror the events of the Climb. It kinda makes sense. The Miss Fortune part with the Illaoi tentacles? It has a lot of association with The Harrowing, which is basically what the Ruined King is going to be about. The part with Ekko and Blitzcrank? Matches with the theme of Conv/rgence (Also means metal man's going to probably be in Conv/rgence too which is exciting &gt;_&lt;).

This might also mean we get to see the continuation of the new Noxus/Ionia invasion in some form or the other soon. Hopefully it's in the form of a new game cause the idea of fighting a war in Ionia sounds dope.

Either way, I hope to see Riot expand their universe and continue the story seen in the cinematics. I'd be disappointed if the stuff in the cinematics is just fluff and not an actual continuation to the lore.",2020-01-03 16:12:47

  A) pick another rune or have a bunch of tank stats that would bring down their early game damage making them much more bearable to lane against for melee in toplane.   
 B) keep conqueror, but miss out on Sorcery or Precision for mages which will only help bring them in line.   


I think this would also help bruisers and tanks as they would get some defensive stats along with the only rune that is really tailored for them. Then they could grab AS from precision or whatever else they needed. Could also be buffed a little bit.

This is important since micro movement DURING level up is necessary so it bothers me quite much. Can anyone tell me what to do?",2020-01-03 19:15:02
leagueoflegends,2020,1,"Is it just me or does League feel like last season's champions and reworks are just adding tons of unfunness to the game.

From Aphelios one shot pentas.  In addition to being completely OP the whole concept of this champion simply doesn't belong in league.  Judging by his ban rate which I'm shocked to see is higher than Yasuo I'm guessing many people echo my thoughts here.

Pyke reset Pentas that give his team the equivalent of 10 kills worth of gold not to mention the ability being an execute with a indicator to make it insanely easy to use. Stealth and health regen so he can play like a complete idiot with no consequences when it doesn't work out.

Then you have Senna the ADC with a root, team stealth, self sustain that deals damage at the same time free scaling from her mist, oh yeah and on top of that she will eventually outrange any champ in the game.

Ryze reworked for the millionth time and still a problem.

Then you have Kayle, Diana, Morde, Garen,Akali and many more I'm too tired to list.

Does the balance team actually try playing against these things instead of just playing as them.  I don't understand how any of this can be thought of as a good idea.  Not to even mention Conqueror the most bullshit of runes that you see at least 7 people running it in every game.

Am I the only one who thinks these changes make the game less fun to play?",2020-01-03 19:15:47

leagueoflegends,2020,1,It is really discouraging when you see a player who is convinced that their season 4 diamond will carry them in their modern day soloqueue games. After not playing well they'll say don't worry guys I was masters and conveniently leave out the season as to not undermine their accomplishment. I understand that the point is to have rank decay and not mmr but after literal seasons maybe they should start back at the default MMR. Too much changes from season to season with new champions and mechanics. Not to mention that the average elo will only get smarter and better with time. Due to the resources available to us today and experience a season 3 diamond might be just as good as a season 8 or 9 gold. MMR should reset after a set time.,2020-01-03 20:22:54

leagueoflegends,2020,1,"According to U.gg, Mord has a 52.78% winrate with a 14% pick rate in Platinum and above. This is really high and very likely puts him into nerf range for next patch. As someone who enjoys playing this champ every once in while, I'd hate to see him get nerfed to oblivion without addressing the real issue: Mord's passive magic penetration mixed with the new conqueror. 

For anyone who doesn't know, the preseason patch changed conqueror from converting 10% of your damage to true damage and healing for that amount to giving a bit more ad/ap and healing for 15% of post-mitigation damage. The way the new conqueror works vastly favors champions with armor/magic penetration or true damage built into their kits. This makes the rune extremely powerful on champions like Darius and Mord while making the rune worse in in both damage and healing for nearly all of its other mainly bruiser users like Jax and Aatrox. 

Back when Mord was reworked, the passive magic penetration on his E was released as a temporary way to make him viable while they worked on AP bruiser items for champs like him, Sylas, Singed and others. We've seen some iterations of items like Catalyst of Aons being thrown out by Riot in the past six months but nothing has hit the PBE. Mord was released in June and we still have no sign of these items even being on Riot's radar while Assassins got a new items and item reworks in the preseason that were out of nowhere and arguably much less needed than good AP bruiser itemization for difficult to balance champs like Sylas and Mord. 

In the coming weeks, I wouldn't be surprised if Mord got hit with hard nerfs without addressing the core issue: passive magic penetration combined with conqueror. I don't even play a lot of Mord but it sucks to see how Riot promised a solution months ago that we still haven't seen and now it seems likely we'll end up with another champ like Sylas, nerfed to oblivion because they dont want to address bigger issues about AP Bruiser itemization.",2020-01-03 20:47:36

leagueoflegends,2020,1,"Hello you people, have a good 2020. I'm FúrinKazan and, although a level 10 account, I'm actually close to 400 in the BR server. I recently tried to reach out to Riot about my projects for League of Legends, but unfortunately they only deal with graduated people. But surely everyone loves how the game is balanced and they're still running after Akali.

Anyway, the projects I made for the game have no use anymore so I decided to publish them all. They are champion kits, counting up to 120 with unique abilities, defined classes, gameplay and numbers for those who like. The idea is to publish one champion per day until April. I also have some champion updades and they might show up sometimes.

I see a lot of good and creative kit concepts and reworks everywhere on the internet. However, if its gameplay is not coherent, it's not a champion. If numbers are not right, it won't work. Riot abandons a lot of cool fantasies because they end up failing at executon, so I bring you the abilities instead, for people to imagine a theme as they want. Here we go:  


&amp;#x200B;

* Hidemasa Hori (names are merely for inspiration and representation)

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**Passive:** After casting an ability, Hidemasa's next two basic attacks receive **50%** additional **Attack Speed**.

Also, within **6** seconds after damaging an enemy champion, basic attacks and successful hits of the **1st Skill** stack **Prestige stakes**, up to **5**. Against enemy champions, duration is renewed. **Prestige stakes** interact with Hidemasa's other abilities and, upon reaching maximum stacks, also grant **175** additional range (**300** total) and basic attacks and the **1st Skill** ignore a percentage of enemies' **Armor**.

\-**Armor ignored: 15/25/35% at levels 1/8/15**

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

1st Skill: Hidemasa energizes his dirk and pierces ahead after a brief delay, dealing damage and **slowing** (decays over **1** second) the first enemy hit within a short line.

After colliding with the first enemy, the damage then spreads within a conical area behind it. For every enemy champion hit, receives a **Prestige stake**.

The initial delay is reduced by additional **Attack Speed**.

**-Damage: 60/100/140/180/220 (+ 70% Bonus AD) as Physical Damage**  
**-Slow: 40/45/50/55/60%**  
**-CD: 7/6/5/4/3 seconds**

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**2nd Skill:** Hidemasa floats and becomes immune to damage for **1.25** seconds. During this time he's also granted additional **Movement Speed** and fires all current **Prestige stakes** as missiles within a line, chosen for each stake within a conical area that doesn't change direction.

Each **Prestige stake** deals damage to enemies they pass through and heals Hidemasa for **60%** of damage dealt to champions (**15%** against minions and monsters). Once fired, they float in the air for up to **6** seconds and each one throw itself against enemies hit by basic attacks or the **1st Skill** to deal **4 (+ 1% Bonus AD)%** of the target's **Maximum Health** as additional **Magic Damage** (doesn't prevent new stacks).

Reaching the maximum number **Prestige stakes** refreshes this ability's **Cooldown**.

**-Damage (per stake): 30/50/70/90/110 (+ 35% Bonus AD)(+ 30% AP) as Magic Damage**  
**-Additional Movement Speed: 25/30/35/40/45%**  
**-CD: 22/21/20/19/18 seconds**

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**3rd Skill:** Hidemasa's gauntlet interacts with the closest enemy champion. If the affected enemy is within **475** range, Hidemasa dashes towards him, dealing **Magic Damage** equal to **50 (+ 5 x level)(+ 40% AP)** and receiving a shield for up to **2.5** seconds.

If Hidemasa interacts with an enemy champion in between **475** and **725** range, the enemy is **pulled** a fixed distance towards him and takes **Magic Damage** equal to **50 (+ 5 x nível)(+ 40% AP)**. An enemy champion dragged into the **1st Skill** takes additional damage.

**-Shield: 70/110/150/190/230 (+ 80% Bonus AD)(+ 60% AP)**  
**-Additional damage: 8/9/10/11/12% of enemy's Maximum Health**  
**-CD: 14/13/12/11/10 seconds**

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**Ultimate:** Hidemasa uses his gauntlet to reproduce his dirk, causing it to emerge within a nearby selected area after a delay. Enemies within the area take damage and, if an enemy champion is hit (prioritizes the one closer to the center), Hidemasa also emerges from the same position to **knock** him **up** for **1.25** seconds, time during which he cannot be interrupted.

**Prestige stakes** fired by the **2nd Skill** throw themselves one after another against the enemy champion hit, dealing 4 **(+ 1% Bonus AD)%** os his **Maximum Health** as **Magic Damage** each. If the **2nd Skill** is not on **Cooldown**, stakes stacked until then are used instead.

This ability's cast range increases by **25%** for each **Prestige stake**, up to **125%** (**1350** total).

**-Damage: 150/275/400 (+ 150% Bonus AD) as Physical Damage**  
**-CD: 120/100/80 seconds**

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

leagueoflegends,2020,1,"He has been broken since his rework.  He is the best champion in the game and he does nothing but button mash.  There is zero gameplay to him.  You either play a champion that beats him or you don't.  If you play a champ that beats him he can kill you if you mess up.  If you don't, he can miss every single Q and still kill you with just his passive.  His ult gives you even less ways to interact with him and makes it so ganking him post 6 is suicide for the jungler even if HE IS BEHIND.

This champion is stupid, it's a terrible rework and it doesn't need to be viable.  Slash him to a 30% winrate and go back to the drawing board.  I'm not saying this is someone who just loses to Mordekaiser.  I'm saying this as someone who picks him whenever he's unbanned even though I don't enjoy him because of how overpowered he is.  I perform better on Morde than champs I've been playing for years because he is completely brainless to play.

leagueoflegends,2020,1,"Obviously there seems to be a huge discrepency in JG and Bot lane EXP right now. What if there was an item similar to elixers, maybe just 250 or so gold that you must have smite to buy( similar to hunters potion), that for about 2 minutes allowed increased EXP from Jg camps. This of course would be limited to like two per game. The idea is that a jungler could make a preemptive decision that they want to farm and the elixer duration would theoretically match the average time for a jungler's full clear. Maybe the enemy jg ganked the opposite side of the map and you can rush his opposite quadrant and your full clear to get a massive advantage. Maybe he got gold from a kill or a summoner but you could get a sizeable lvl advantage from his camps he's missing out on.This could work for multiple types of junglers. Aoe junglers could use it as a win more item to buy if they are getting kills and want to stay relevant in levels to the solo laners. For power farmers it could be an item to help facilitate getting to those important level spikes.

I feel like something like this could help facilitate more jg variety, and different strategies to try to play the jg. I know drags are obviously king but this could help jglers that can't fight at 5 minutes right now stand a better chance or make the enemy team stall til they are or even sack the first drag and farm up to contest all the other ones.

There is no item in the game that counters any of those, along with her taking conqueror and getting the free tenacity in the tree, she gets a total of 51% tenacity, so even the CC does not counter the champion.  


Master yi with duskblade ruins the very notion that you can CC master yi when he isn't in his Q and blow him up, with duskblade there are no downframe to cc him so there is no possibility to play against the champion.  


Imperial mandate Ashe with manamune makes a 3 seconds CD spell that is utterly unavoidable by movement or dashing dealing 400 total damage because the item is meant for supports, and one lone ADC can abuse it.

Won't the shield/bubble (in theory) collide with the enemy champion that she is dashing to? What or how it would feel like being hit by the shield from the perspective of the champion that is fighting Quinn in this scenario? Would the shield/bubble make any sort of collision and/or impact with the enemy champion upon her dashing to said enemy?

leagueoflegends,2021,1,"# TL;DR

TL;DR, Lets give the highest burst role in the game more percentage armor pen, sustain and a shield while being almost statistically better than assassin items from before the rework. This also includes all items in the game being generally stronger in some way compared to previous items without changing a large portion of the champions balance in order to keep it fun and interesting.

# The Role of an Assassin

It is no secret that assassins are early game power houses by default. It is often hard to keep up with a mid lane assassins damage as any other role in the game, simply because they are designed to be strong early, and fall off later into the game. This was consistent throughout the previous seasons of league and was the status quo of assassins in season 10, so that will be the reference point. Thus, the role of an assassin is usually to get an early lead, and then snowball the game for themselves or their other laners in order to make the game very difficult to come back from. This is the basic idea of an assassin and their role on the rift.

By nature, Assassins are feast or famine. They either succeed in their ability to out skill the opponent, or fail and are little use to their team. With all of this in mind, here is why Eclipse is one of if not the worst designed items in league of legends history.

# The Problems with Eclipse

There are a lot of tools that Eclipse gives an assassin. There is a passive damage boost which always gets activated during a burst combo, dealing effectively 60-200 damage to squishy targets depending on HP and grants a small shield to the assassin. This item also gives Percent Armor Penetration (up to 20%) on its Mythic passive, as well as flat lethality. Continually, there is 10% omnivamp on the item for sustain, with 55 Attack damage. For reference, the lethality and attack damage values are identical to pre-rework Youmuu's Ghostblade, which was a common first item for assassins at a comparable cost. As well as the item passive damage being similar to that of pre-rework Duskblade, another commonly built starting item for assassins pre-rework.

There are 3 problems with this item. The first one is the 10% omnivamp. Assassins are designed to kill, how ever melee assassins often lose trades to ranged matchups and are required to all in. With 10% omnivamp along side Ravenous Hunter, healing is almost never an issue. Because Vamp Scepter builds into Eclipse, getting early lifesteal is really easy, and provides more value than even pre-lethality Blade of the Ruined King did for Zed back in Season 3-6. This allows assassins to keep up in losing lanes, and after picking up eclipse, essentially always go into a fight at full HP, and never requiring to play passive if they take a bad trade. This now removes some of the high skill cap that is required to play assassins, because messing up has less penalty than before.

The second problem with Eclipse is the Percent armor penetration on the mythic passive. Percent armor penetration is often times the best stat against any character that builds armor items. Why this stat becomes an issue on an assassin item is because that then gives 2 different stats to deal with armor. Flat armor negation with lethality, and then percent armor negation. Because of this, building armor items is almost worthless, because stacked with full lethality items plus selling boots, assassins and anyone who builds Eclipse plus Serylda's Grudge will have a cap of 50% armor penetration PLUS lethality. What is armor anyways right? For reference, I have seen a Zed 1 shot a full tank J4 through Gargoyles and 300 armor. This isn't to say that this did not exist in season 10. Lethality items plus a flat penetration item were often built on assassins in season 10 with Duskblade, Youmuu's, Edge of night and then Lord Dominik's Regards being the most common. How ever, Lord Dominiks only gave 35% where Serylda's and Eclipse can give upwards of 50%. This makes a big deal later on in the game as more armor gets shredded.

The last problem I have with the item is the idea behind the item. Assassins are meant to be countered by tanks. Tanks are designed to be unburst-able to some extent, why are we suddenly seeing AD assassins killing tanks? Because Eclipse enables this to happen. The item provides too much value at all stages of the game which allows assassins to never fall off and dominate the game even until 50+ minutes. The item was so broken that in high elo solo queue, Shen was building this item to synergize with his Q passive.

# A Broader look

So what would I do in order to nerf the item? Because the item itself is flawed, I actually don't think the item should exist at all with the current stat line of the item. It covers too many roles, does too many jobs, and ultimately should be reworked into something that is less powerful.

By extension, All items in the game somehow became stronger, or perceptibly stronger, with little to no changes to champions besides the biggest problem champions in the game. The idea of an item swap-up is not a bad one inherently, the problem comes when there was not enough changing or testing during the pre-season to bring champions back in line with the new items. If items as a whole are strong, then items need to be nerfed, or the entire cast of champions who use the items need to be nerfed. If we are to assume the game before pre-season was in a mostly balanced state, which is debatable but will be used as a baseline, then almost all roles got a general increase in power, without much tuning to the roles themselves. In turn the game may still be balanced by numbers, but by player feel, the game is off by a large margin and needs significant balancing time in order to get the game back in line.

The holiday season is almost over, the season is just over a week out. Riot just threw out 10 years of item balance. The ball is in your court Riot, lets see how quickly you can get the game back in line.",2021-01-01 02:12:21

leagueoflegends,2021,1,"The speed boost areas of the cloud drake level give 35% speed multiplier.  So a faster champion will out run a slower champion in this area.  I don't even buy boots anymore because boots don't give mythic bonuses that a proper t3 item gets so I'm often slower than other opponents.  I think twice before going into cloud speed zone areas if someone is chasing me with a good speed, because their advantage gets amplified.

All that is fun and good, but here is where the math gets wonky: There are various times where a lower speed individual doesn't get run down as fast as pure 35% would suggest.  An example would be if the faster guy is entering a diminishing return step of the speed number(Go too fast and each point makes you go faster only a little more).   So that is the major factor. Another factor is, ""How much difference is there between you and your opponent's speed.  Greater amounts cannot be mitigated easily.""  I don't actually want to do the math, but I can see some really interesting functions are there.  Feel free to crack the code yourself and do the math.",2021-01-01 02:24:43

leagueoflegends,2021,1,"With all the new champions added to the game, league was slowly introducing more and more power creep to this game. The new power levels become the standard after their release and something more op has to be released in the next update. Pokemon is an extreme example of power creep, where whenever newer Pokemons were released most of the old pokemons became weaker.

At first, when Riot decided to introduce item changes, I thought it would another big power creep introduced to the game. After reading all the items and theorycrafting different builds, I think these items are way more healthier and will improve LOL's meta. Here are few points for my reasoning.

1. With the introduction to more grievous wound and less overall sustain items, those sustain builds are removed. At the same time, newer bruiser items feel way better and modern to use compared to just having death's dance healing for every single bruiser build.
2. Jungle enchantment removal gives jungler access to their core items sooner making jungle itemization more diverse and healthy.
3. The mythic items with strong effects like invisibility and dashes are balanced by having premium pricing. This means none of them should overtake meta like deaths dance.

Lastly, many players are always building mythic items first. Because of mythic passive, making them as 2nd, 3rd or even 4th item can be better. You never build rabadon or infinity edge first item, since you do not get its full value immediately. There are lot of good legendary items for every stage of the game and players should not ignore them over mythic items.

Here is 1 legendary item combo. On bruiser, going steraks + gargoyle + titanic, then you could go stridebreaker so that you can sell boots late game and free up an item slot. Mindlessly rushing Mythic items are not good, unless it is moonstone on supports.

I think in the future, lot more interesting build will pop up. This item set looks promising.",2021-01-01 03:12:46

She can flex support, has clear counter-play with her floaty abilities, and has clearly visible team contributions. She has obvious skill expression and variability in her skill shots and she can cc people pre-6 so she can properly peel others. The mythic that she builds, from Moonstone to Liandry's to Luden's to Mandate, as well as the legendaries that support that choice, are based on what her aims are in each game.

Sona: Supportive/Offensive enchanter champion that scales into late game by consuming exorbitant amounts of gold. She once flexed solo lanes, but that got her and Spellthief's Edge nerfed, so now she doesn't. No cc pre-6, so if someone hard engages you, you die or burn sums with almost 0 say on the matter. Her entire kit is automatically aimed, so the counter-play to her is ""kill her"", akin to most hyper carries like Kayle, Trist, Kai'Sa, and so on...but you're the support.

leagueoflegends,2021,1,"I took what i see aatrox players normally build around lvl 11 and 18 for the test to see how much they get from goredrinker healing 

===================================================================================

At lvl 11(has 1850hp): all conq stacks, having goredrinker,ravenous hydra and a pickaxe while using ult he had 370 ad and lets say for safety aatrox hits hydra at 30% or 555hp so he gets bonus 14% ad so now he has 421 ad and activates goredrinker so if he hits 5 targets he deals 110% ad so that will deal 463 attack  damage and lets say the enemy team block % is (30%, 30%, 50%,50%,40%) so all in all aatrox will deal(324,324,231,231,255) and his e would heal 25% of this damage and 18% omnivamp from ravenous and hunter would also heal for this damage.Healing from e (81hp,81hp,57hp,57hp,63hp).Healing from ravenous (58hp,58hp,41hp,41hp,45hp). In case I miss understood healing i am going to combine these numbers so it will be (139hp,139hp,98hp,98hp,108hp). now if we increase by aatrox ult this healing will be increased by 75% so it's(243hp,243hp,171hp,171hp,189hp) (you could also see the amount of healing from conq but to lazy for that).

&amp;#x200B;

now for the goredrinker part of goredrinker so at 555hp he is missing 1255hp and 12% of that is 150hp and 20% of ad is 92 so that together is 242hp healed per champion hit but this is also increased 75% by the ult so it will be 423hp .so 423\*5 is 2117hp

But let's say by any chance that the most likely happened and the enemy has ignite that will reduce healing by 60 so now healing is. 2117 is 846 and (243,243,171,171,189) is (97,97,68,68,75) and this amount of hp is you know when you are surrounded by 5 people not really op considering i went really into Aatrox's favor except the grevious wounds part  all this every 15 seconds but unlike gargoyle stoneplate it cannot be activated while stunned and is not reduced by an summoner or 800g item.

(40% grevious)(2117 is 1270 and (243,243,171,171,189) is (145,145,102,102,113) again really not that great)

==============================================================================

I will add a !!! when i add the % from spirit visage

At lvl 18(has 3260hp):all conq,goredrinker,ravenous,deaths dance,black cleaver,spirit visage,ninja tabi while using ult he had 549 ad and lets say for safety aatrox hits hydra at 20% or 652hp so he gets bonus 15% ad so now he has 631 ad and activates goredrinker so if he hits 5 targets he deals 110% ad so that will deal 694 attack damage and lets say the enemy team block % is (40%, 50%, 50%,50%,60%) so all in all aatrox will deal(416,347,347,347,277)and his e would heal 30% of this damage and 18% omnivamp from ravenous and hunter would also heal for this damage.Healing from e (124hp,104hp,104hp,104hp,83hp).Healing from ravenous (74hp,62hp,62hp,62hp,49hp). Again in case I miss understood healing i am going to combine these numbers so it will be (198hp,164hp,164hp,164hp,132hp). now if we increase by aatrox ult this healing will be increased by 100% so it's !!!(495hp,410hp,410hp,410hp,330hp) {Now conq also heals for 9% of dealt dmg so it would be for Aatrox with this build(dmg\*(9/100)\*2\*(25/100)) }.

&amp;#x200B;

now for the goredrinker active so at 652hp he is missing 2608hp and 12% of that is 312hp and 20%(631ad)  is 126ad so that together is 478hp healed per champion hit but this is also increased 100% by R and 25% spirit visage so it will  !!! 1195\*5 which comes around to 5975hp healed and now the finale where we amplify 60% grevious wounds so 5975hp comes around to 2390hp and (495hp,410hp,410hp,410hp,330hp) is (198,164,164,164,99)hp every 7 seconds 

&amp;#x200B;

(Sidenote went into practice tool to damage test if it's possible really to kill something like 110armor 110mr 3,6hp monster more defensive stats than this aatrox has) in 5seconds  did it wit Lux as the standard mage and so did Sivir as the the most basic marksmen(no slow, no cc,)

&amp;#x200B;

(BUT here's another little side note. Aatrox is the champion who can double his healing on any other champion with these numbers it would be healing just 2985 and this is best case scenario of hitting 5 people if it hit 3 it would be 1791(just 716 late game with 60%grevious) every 7 seconds but let's say now you do have 2500 hp that can still be taken down in 2-5 seconds that's why on warwick for example gargoyle would be so much better for enabling his drain tank)

&amp;#x200B;

This is just to show how strong goredrinker really is and on Aatrox who just may get the most healing out of this item. it's just mediocre in every stage where there are cons and pros never really being weak or overpowered maybe early lvl 6-8 mythic it is op because the heal is enough to full hp while the enemy laner may not have 40% grevious wounds(even though there's ignite that you get a lot of value against champs that go goredrinker) and the 15 second cdr doesn't really matter because you will need it only once during the towerdive",2021-01-01 06:37:56

I mean, It's just that his skins are mostly around nature and not much else to it with the exception of Mewokai, Worldbreaker and kind of Victorious.

Sure I guess you can keep the nature theme, but I kind of want a skin for Maokai that turns it into something OTHER than nature to spice things a bit up (Or at least have the Nature theme not be it's main theme, despite still being there in the skin in terms of their visual design) which is what the choices of the skinlines are gonna be based on.

leagueoflegends,2021,1,Champions In the Real World (Garen) #Shorts,2021-01-01 08:16:55
leagueoflegends,2021,1,"I would like to note that this list isn't some sorta RITO PLS GIVE MOAR SKINS post, but I do think it gives some insight as to how well some of the oldest champions in the game have been given attention to by riot, specifically in the cosmetics department. A champ not necessarily having a legendary skin doesn't mean the champ is neglected or unpopular, but I've always seen the idea of a champ having one is ""I'm established within the League Community enough that Riot has decided to give me something truly special and super high-quality"". I've always entertained the thought that Riot would eventually want to be able to give each of the original 40 a legendary skin, I can't exactly explain why I think this, but I do. 
 
Of the original 40 champions of league, 18 of them do NOT have any skins officially labelled as ""Legendary"" tier according to the wiki, and they are:
 
- Gangplank
- Malphite
- Singed
- Amumu
- Evelynn 
- Fiddlesticks
- Rammus
- Shaco
- Warwick
- Karthus
- Kassadin
- Ryze
- Sivir
- Twitch
- Alistar
- Blitzcrank
- Taric
- Zilean
 
Now I was originally really surprised to see this many champs with no legendary skins but then I realized it's sorta misleading, especially with things like promotional skins that you can't get anymore (Grey Warwick, Medieval Twitch, UFO Corki, etc), skins that are exclusive to Hextech Crafting, and Prestige skins, so I decided to go through the list again and this time remove any champion from the list who falls under those categories. Note: any super rare skin that still has an RP price doesn't count for the purposes of this post

The list of champions without a legendary skin, promotional skin, hextech skin, or prestige skin are:

- Gangplank
- Fiddlesticks
- Shaco
- Karthus
- Blitzcrank
- Taric
- Zilean

One thing I've noticed is that the champions on this list either happen to have multiple skins at 1350 (which could offset the lack of an 1820) or they have almost none at all. Here's a few personal notes I have on each of the champions listed:

- Gangplank has a total of 10 skins, 3 at 1350. He's definitely not lacking in skins, I'm just surprised he hasn't had a legendary yet though. Though, tbh what WOULD a legendary GP skin be? Someone go get Tobias Fate lmao
 
- Fiddle has a total of 9 skins, 2 are 1350, and I'm not actually too surprised he doesn't have a legendary yet as he DID get reworked this year so all his skins at least feel new despite most of them being before 2012 with the exceptions being Risen (2015) and Praetorian (2018)
 
- Shaco also has 9 skins, with 2 being 1350. I honestly don't know much about Shaco to form an opinion on him, but one thing I noticed is that Riot does still know he exists; his skin releases are *sorta* consistent, there is a gap between Wild Card (2015) and Dark Star (2019)
 
- Karthus has 7 skins, 1 is 1350. Ok, here's my deal with Karthus in particular as he's my OTP main and has been since Season 3 almost; My issue is that despite being reworked in 2014, he's had a grand total of 3 skins released afterward, 1 of them being an E-sports skin, the other being released 4 years after his rework (Lightsbane), and his latest one being 4 years after THAT (Infernal). On top of that, not only is Infernal the only skin that's 1350, but the fact that it took 11 or so YEARS before Karthus got his FIRST 1350 skin is just really frustrating. I'm not bashing the skin btw, it looks fantastic and I LOVE the impact sound on his ult with it, but I'm just frustrated it took THIS LONG for some really good Karthus stuff is all. I feel like if anyone on this particular list deserves a legendary skin, it's gotta be Karthus. 
 
- Blitzcrank has 11 skins, 6 are 1350. Blitz happens to have the MOST 1350-tier skins, and yes I'm counting both Lancer variants as separate skins. He's almost the same as GP in that he does have a lot of skins and he DEFINITELY has enough 1350-tier skins to maybe justify not giving him a legendary. That being said, what would a legendary Blitz skin be like? 
 
- Taric has 5 skins, 2 are 1350. I don't think Taric was popular at all outside of his memes, would probably explain why he only had 3 skins before his rework. Taric was reworked in 2016, and then given his first 1350 skin a couple months afterward, which I think is great for a champion to get shortly after getting reworked. Perhaps what isn't quite so great is that he had to wait 4 years before Luminshield got released. I think he could probably use a legendary skin soon, to not get one would be... *Truly Outrageous.*

- Zilean has 6 skins, 1 is 1350. Zilean is just about in the same boat as Karthus here, he's got one less skin, and it took 10 years since his release before he got his first 1350. Why did it take so long for these champs to get a 1350-tier skin? 

idk, this is all just something I felt like putting together, partially as something to think about regarding the first 40 champions of League of Legends, Mostly because I wanted to rant about Karthus and how I feel like sometimes he was just sorta neglected prior to his Infernal skin and I just want a legendary for him already XD",2021-01-01 08:20:46

leagueoflegends,2021,1,"Hey, I returned to League after a year of absence and immediately had to run into the abomination that is the item shop. I'm not sure how ""new"" it actually is and how much time people had to get used to it, discuss it and Riot to maybe react to feedbacks.

I'm just wondering what's the general opinion on the item shop, is there anything about it that people are widespread against and whether Riot has addressed anything about those things, if such things exist.

Personally I can't fathom how terrible it is to navigate. I'm not saying it after the first time, I've actually been back for about 2 weeks now, played a good couple of games, I learned to use it, but it's still bad. I gave it time, but turns out it's not about being new and unfamiliar, but it's actually trash.

1. No matter what you do, the dumbass ""suggested"" page opens up by default and you can't change this. Not even dedicated item sets will change this.

2. The ""all items"" is not actually all items, because it automatically selects a group of items that it thinks you might want to buy. Of course this also can't be changed.

3. How innovative that instead of a simple drag-and-drop format to resize the shop window, you now have to go to the menu, change the value, exit the menu, open the shop, realize that it's not right and the cycle repeats. Sure you only need to set it once, but still...

4. Talking about sizing, it was truly a wonderful idea to make the proportions of the different segments of the shop completely ridiculous and nonsense, while at the same time removing the feature of customizing the proportions. Why wouldn't you want 75% of the screen to be occupied by like 2 or 3 suggested items, while item descriptions are crammed into a tiny space, which on top of everything is a narrow vertical rectangle shape, so even a short, 1-2 sentence description takes like 10 rows of text, which of course doesn't fit, so you have to scroll. Fascinating stuff.

5. And just to insult you even more, they added the super helpful side-panels for basic items which opens when you hover over, but fear not, because there's a glimpse of hope for customization: you can pin the panels to stay open - until the next game of course when it forgets your preference and removes the pin.

leagueoflegends,2021,1,Me and my friends heading into our first game of 2021 and this happened,2021-01-01 10:27:49
leagueoflegends,2021,1,"Let's say, for the sake of argument, that my bot laner sees Jhin/Xerath bot-lane in Smurf-Queue, and in response picks Illaoi ADC, dies a bunch of times and then runs around the map randomly, seemingly just trying to screw up mid and top lane, and admits, repeatedly, that he doesn't care about winning the game, why is that not punishable? Why does he get to vote no on surrenders and hold games hostage when he's the reason we lost the game in champion select? I don't understand why that's okay, just because on Illaoi he can smash his face on his keyboard and go 6/7/2 (a net even score) while he's trolling in a game he doesn't care about winning? What was the point of Riot going out of their way to make us sign a waiver, as a condition of playing their game, to actually try to win games that we play if there's seemingly no system in place to enforce that rule? Or to punish other forms of blatant trolling?

And on that note, would a little bit more transparency with how your reports are handled kill the folks at Riot? Why is the system set up such that they only give you vague feedback when a troll in your games is punished for something that you maybe reported him for, or maybe not you don't know, if the game where you reported them is only a part of your last three games? I don't understand that. Personally, I'd like to know who it was, what champ they were on, and what their punishment was, and a rundown of the steps taken to arrive at that punishment (Automated review, manual review, community review, manual review, player review, manual review, punishment, or some such) at LEAST, so that I actually feel like my complaints are being heard by a company with more than enough resources to hear them. And fuck me, I could create a system which a company like this could use to just check a box and send it to the next step in the process, and I've only got MAYBE year and a half of software design experience. Fuck me, I could build it as a webapp and GIVE the bitch to Riot if they'd actually use it! Free of charge!

And why would it be so impossible to consider the context in which things are said when they dish out punishment for chat, if they're going to give even self-admitted trolls every possible chance at reforming themselves, even seemingly going so far as to read ""yeah idc about winning the game"" as an isolated sentence with no context, that's just banter between teams, not deserving of punishment for the rather obvious violation of the rules that they agreed to follow?

This isn't a rant post, per se, and if the mods wanna ask me to re-write this with less of a call-out tone, I will, I genuinely want to understand why troll picks aren't punishable, and have a discourse with the community about how Riot could make a system that actually punishes players for trolling, and that better rewards players for reporting players who deliberately ruin games, in a way that helps players to learn and identify reportable behaviors. I'd even go so far as to wager that if Riot listened to the genuine, good faith feedback from the community on this one, it could lead to a system which removes much of the overt toxicity from the game, and lowers the sheer number of reports. Idk. Anyway, Reddit, do your thing and rip me a new one for no reason LMAO.

leagueoflegends,2021,1,"""It's hard not to be similar to Sona, especially because she's our only other music-based champ.""

Okay, challenge accepted.

Top- FREJLORIDIAN BARD WITH THE SPIRIT OF AN OPERA SINGER WARRIOR

This unassuming Frejlordian bard is haunted by a mighty warrior in his horn, whose memory only survives through the songs of an opera. He's like Gnar but both forms are melee, and his ult is to blow his horn to activate his bigger opera warrior form immediately. When his passive bar (which rises through farming or hitting abilities on champions) fills up, you hear a haunting tune in the BGM which becomes steadily louder and then explodes to the forefront after his form change. The benefit of ulting early is that it doesn't fill his passive bar, so you could potentially double the duration of your larger form. If you fill it up while your form is large, the music becomes EVEN MORE DRAMATIC.

&amp;#x200B;

Jungle - SINISTER WANDERING FLUTIST ASSASSIN

Another form-change champ, only this one is like Elise or Nidalee, where she can change whenever. Normally, he just plays his flute to the creatures of the Jungle to soothe them, before revealing his ALTER EGO FORM CHANGE where he slaughters them because actually the flute is a knife! Nothing personal, kid. The ult is a charm, sort of a Pied Piper of Hamelin deal. You know how Evelynn's W has the charm activate after the mark fills up? The has you charm the person until the mark fills up, and you only deal damage if you reactivate it at that specific point in time, where you do a dramatic slash.

&amp;#x200B;

Mid - MASTER THIEF PUNK STAR ZAUNITE

This girl is not having the best time. She's poor, she's dirty, her street performances -as awesome as they are - get overlooked every day, and she hears voices in her head. One day, they lead her to a treasure trove of machinery - with the promise of leading her to more. The voice's only condition is that she must extract the crystals and hoarde them. No questions asked. She's an auto-reliant Mage whose abilities revolve around kiting her opponents with illusions. Kind of like attack speed Neeko only, you know, NOT an accident. Her auto attacks become stronger the more she autos (straight up has Orianna's passive), she has an auto reset, she has a backslide that moves her backwards while leaving a trail of damage, she leaves controllable clones that deal more damage to opponent the more 'convincing' her performances with them are, and her ult uses hextech crystals to knock her opponents away with a loud noise from her speakers.

&amp;#x200B;

ADC - It's just Jhin. Come on. Like. Come on. He's even obsessed with the most basic time signature. His autos are stuck on a specific rhythm. Do I really need to convince you. Just dress him up as a Maestro. Or like. The Phantom of the Opera. He already has the mask.

&amp;#x200B;

Support - BIG NOXIAN DRUMMER BOI

A THICC Alistar-esque Support Tank with a massive drum. The E builds up stacks similar to Alistar's, and at full stacks, it empowers one of his other abilities Applies a brief knock-up to surrounding enemies with a big BANG of his drum on W; an empowered W does bigger damage and CC. Q rolls him forward in a straight line - empowered Q STARTS the root with a root around BIG DRUMMER BOI. His ult has him perform a crazy drum solo which empowers allies around him, increasing their movespeed and giving them all a fat shield (LET'S DROP THE BEAT).",2021-01-01 10:42:59

It is the worlds most played game so it might even have a chance.

leagueoflegends,2021,1,"Hey guys, just thought I’d make a post about this since I’ve heard a lot of rumours but not a lot of facts about prestige skins making a comeback near the half way end of this year due to the prestige changes that may be made. 

I just wanted to know peoples thoughts and peoples opinions about this topic as I really want them to come back due to my main/s having prestige skins but I wasn’t playing league when they came out so I think it’s unfair how I never got the chance to be able to obtain them any other way but from gambling and yet I’ve tried and never gotten any success, as of yet. 

Speaking of that though, since I don’t own prestige skins for any of my mains I can’t say the ones I do have hold much value to me as I don’t play them but bought it for more of an exclusive skin. Speaking of such I was wondering if they did bring them back would this upset those who may have worked hard by grinding out points to get them? Although a counter argument could be what if the older ones cost more? 150-200 prestige points so then it still is more exclusive and you can’t buy as many? 

I just wanted to address the rumours and ask if anyone has any information and can link sources to it that would be very helpful ^^ and please do have discussions below as I’m always grateful to hear other peoples prospectives and opinions. 

I don’t think they will bring them back as much as I do want them too as I do think it’s unfair to the people who did get the skins the fair way. But also owning some prestige skins I wouldn’t mind letting others be able to purchase them if it was available to do so.",2021-01-01 10:51:41

I love the idea of supporting my teammates since I do not have high reflex and I find champions with high skill ceiling like Zed or Irelia a little bit confusing.  Used to play Lissandra and Quinn (both top/mid) since they could roam around the map and help with map control. But now I find them to be kinda sluggish and Lissandra's movement speed is kinda slow so roaming isn't possible.

 Do you have other champs for my playstyle? Simple enough but can still support team in case I'm behind.",2021-01-01 11:33:46

Blitzcrank's Q is already one of the most powerful CC's in the game, only it's 5x stronger in ARAM. The victim is almost always going to die from it because Blitzcrank's entire team is always near him to follow-up on the grab + E knock-up.

leagueoflegends,2021,1,"Now it's harder than usual because they just go afk for anything. I ping my toplane that tanks 2 waves and the enemy Nasus  to go back, dies and is 0-2 now ""I afk because u ping me"" and then shouting all chat "" Twitch put me behind"" , i was never in his lane but enemy says they will report me.

Gank midlane  who is 1-3 and hold onto my E until enemy is out of my midlaner spells  and get the kill ,"" WHY U KS ME"" and then they go afk.  
Ganked my midlane who was not losing (6-1) and he went directly afk because i walked into his lane.

Another game my jungler went afk because i was not supposed to gank lanes and the only things he can do is farm and get drakes and there are no kills left for him.

My random adc i get rarely complain about my pick because i always keep them really fed but every other lane is a fiesta of mental trainwrecks.

And there is nothing i can do about that and the fact that people agrees with them and i get reported every bad match they have, just getting stuff of my chest at this point because nothing will be done.

I just want them to stop doing  that and play.",2021-01-01 11:57:58
leagueoflegends,2021,1,The Most Legendary Western LoL Team Ever? Where is Moscow5 Now,2021-01-01 12:03:13
leagueoflegends,2021,1,"So I have some thoughts. Let's say Thresh and Quinn were on the same team on Summoner's Rift and Thresh threw his lantern to Quinn to shield/bubble her during a heated fight with an enemy champion. Now let's say Quinn dashed towards the enemy champion using E while still being in the protective bubble/shield, by dashing to the enemy champion, she is literally in the enemy's face, so my question is this, since the souls are actively shielding her in a bubble during this time, what impact would it have on the enemy champion, when she is dashing right into them with E? Won't the shield/bubble (in theory) collide with the enemy champion that she is dashing to? What or how it would feel like being hit by the shield from the perspective of the champion that is fighting Quinn in this scenario? Would the shield/bubble make any sort of collision and/or impact with the enemy champion upon her dashing to said enemy? Of course I am not asking from a gameplay perspective, but rather trying to make sense of it from a lore perspective.",2021-01-01 12:15:37

leagueoflegends,2021,1,"I play League for a while now, I remember my first skin being Chosen Master Yi, I love star Wars and this was a obvious inspiration on Star Wars skin. But I always wonder why LOL does not make collabs, for example in Japan i think it would be successful a collab with the Fate series since the premise of summoner and legends working together are similar. 

Why Fortnite can make skins of the Mandalorian and other media like Borderlands and Walking Dead but lol never collabs, they sure make inspiration skins for example Spirit Blossom Riven is a nod to Susano Sasuke of Naruto. Does it disturb the game ambient? We have pop star and K pop skins does it really matter? 

Some champions would make great star Wars skins especially now with the Star Wars fever of the Mandalorian. Is it hard to mix the champion kit with the lore of the franchise? 

Smite did this with Avatar the Last Airbender and I think it worked fine.

leagueoflegends,2021,1,I play both but I don't know who to fully main out of Hecarim and Thresh who has the most advantages when playing and least counters?,2021-01-01 13:09:52
leagueoflegends,2021,1,"So far, it seems that with some more adjustments the goal of giving every class different mythic options game to game can be met. But it's come at the cost of alienating champions whose builds fall in between or outside of classes, more than they'd already been. 

Namely: Gangplank, Gnar, Yasuo, Yone, and Tryndamere. 

We'll set aside Tryndamere, since his passive and ultimate make him the least vulnerable to item changes. Unlike Yasuo or Yone, he doesn't have to buy crit to have it and as such doesn't have to build it at all if fighter items become better.

And Yasuo and Yone have already received buffs, but more importantly the Mythic passives of the marksmen items they have to buy suit them. Shieldbow essentially replaced the old Phantom Dancer and provides defense on top of that, or Kraken Slayer provides more AS and can be stacked by their Q's. Even with those aside, it'd be a simple matter of readjusting their crit bonus to account for the per-item reduction.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, for the two it hurt more.

Gnar's in the same boat he's always been in, being a marksman most of the time who turns into a tank instead of a damage dealer like other transforming champs. Which I think should be adjusted somehow but has been exacerbated by these changes. Marksman items still won't work because he still needs to be able to survive in Mega, but now his core item-- Frozen Mallet-- has been removed completely. Sunderer, though it does have health, doesn't suit him well since he only has two long-cooldown abilities to proc it in mini *and* its damage is penalized for being ranged. 

Gangplank's main issues stem from sheen and being melee. He lost a ton of mana with the recipe change, and none of the sheen options suit him. Sunderer doesn't apply its %HP damage or heal if you use it on barrels, and the Mythic passive is heavily reduced when combined with his barrels because of how %armor pen stacks. He has no synergy with AS and difficulty continuously attacking, so both Trinity's new passive and mythic passive work poorly on him. For the same reason, he can't build Essence Reaver even though it's now a sheen item, and no longer suits most of the crit items because he can't afford to sink 3 items worth of gold into it now that the stat itself relies more on attack speed. 

&amp;#x200B;

The solution is probably going to have to be mini-reworks to the two of them, since they don't have the mechanics to just do stat changes like the other three. But regardless of what Riot decides to do, they do need to do something.",2021-01-01 13:12:59

leagueoflegends,2021,1,"Basically, any champion that relies on healing in their kit is now useless, while champion that build multiple vamp items (omnivamp and lifesteal) and use all the vamp runes heal usually so much that sometimes it's really better to invest into ways to oneshot them instead of gw that feels useless against them anyway. So we need grevious wounds to be more punishing for vamp effects, while not throwing healing champions even more into the gutter. 

This would have to be precisely balanced by the numbers, but to illustrate, I was thinking something along the lines of 30/30 for the basic items (resulting in total 51% reduction for champions getting their heal from vamp) and 50/50 for full effects (resulting in total 75% healing reduction for champions getting their heal from vamp)

This would help a bit currently struggling healing champions, while further affecting things that get ridiculous healing just from runes and items. Goredrinker would be buffed by these changes, but if goredrinker alone is the problem, there's nothing easier than nerfing the active. Also the changes coming in next patch look promising already.

I don't know if this is the best way, but I'm certainly getting sick of the way thing currently are, and I'm not alone.",2021-01-01 13:41:32

leagueoflegends,2021,1,"Hey everyone! I’m really interested in making the switch to LoL. I’m a long time MOBA player, specifically Smite. I’ve been playing since the game was released and I’ve generally been a diamond player so I’m quite comfortable within these genre of games.

However, I know nothing about LoL. Never played it or watched any videos on it whatsoever but I really want to get into it. Any tips on where to start?

I’m a hardcore competitive gamer that’s played on teams and in leagues for Smite so I’m more than willing to put the time and effort in to learn the various champions and items in this game but I recently read that there’s like 140 different champions. Who do I start playing first? (Smite ADC Main) What game modes are best to play for someone with MOBA experience but still needs to figure out the game? Any good suggestions for websites with builds on them or specific content creators to watch? Also, will any of my Smite knowledge transfer over to LoL and give me an edge on other new players or are they so different that it doesn’t matter?

I haven’t even loaded up the game for the first time and I already feel very overwhelmed by the whole thing, yet at the same time I’m so excited to learn everything. Any help would be appreciated! Thank you to anyone and everyone that takes the time to read this post. I appreciate all of you.

Edit; Wow, thank you to everyone who responded! I got a lot of great suggestions and I’m looking forward to putting them to good use. Hopefully I’ll see you all in game soon!",2021-01-01 14:02:44

leagueoflegends,2021,1,"Just wondering if anyone else is having this or noticed it, but is healing reduction bugged at the moment, every game I play in which I buy a healing reduction item, it doesnt stop nearly enough healing as it should? 

Like the aram game below for example, they have mundo, liss and seraphine all of which heal + the healing shrines. I bought oblivion orb litterally first item and stopped 172 healing all game which I would think more would should be done in 1 fight not 172 the whole match? 

Anyone else noticed this? It wasn't just me either, tristana has healing reduction and jhin at one point had it but none of us were above 300 healing stopped in a 23 minute game?

leagueoflegends,2021,1,"It has been 5 years since I played for the first time and my journey ended in plat4 78 lp, it was enough.

So why did I quit?

1. terrible matchmaking experience, unbalace. There wasn't single game where at least 1 person wasn't toxic. I won't talk about OTP Irelia and autofilled top. The game is basically telling you to play as team, but how can you cooperate with someone that basically wants to just destroy your day. feeders, toxic players, egoistic players, every single game.
2. Champion balance. We all know that being  metaslave is the only way to enjoy League. For me, playing champions that I like and I'm good at, playing against 70% winrate champ is straight unfun.
3. Champion/skin releases. Last season or so, it seems like Riot got bought by Disney. 2nd KD/A, just why.

Last words are, that League when you try to be better is just unfun, especially this preseason. I've spent 2.5k hours on this game, so I know what I'm saying. I like to watch League, but hate to play it. But good things it thought me are : patience, you have to wait for something in order to achieve it. Vision of me getting better at something, that I can be better in that game. Strong mental, knowing that getting mad won't solve anything and keeping focused is the only way to win games/solve problems. Ability to talk, negotiate and interact with imbeciles, egoists, ignorants, angry people, shittalkers, toxic people, bad players and straight assholes, is the best thing I learned. Few ways to talk to these kinds of people, getting them to cooperate or just to listen. Most of the time I had to show them their place, tell them to not behave like kids on playground and telling them to man up and focus to win the game and adding it's their mmr, lp and time too. Most of the time it worked and they actually were good players. It was just enough to spill my cup of patience. Peace out.",2021-01-01 15:21:26

leagueoflegends,2021,1,"**Funfire Wincape is still picked most of the time despite the nerfs.** Meanwhile, Frostfire Gauntlet and Turbo Chemtank remain severely underplayed. And no sheer number nerfs are going to change why it happened. Because **Frostfire Gauntlet and Turbo Chemtank effects are just meh.** That's it. They're useless for the class that they're supposedly destined for. Redundant with what tank kits already have.

First, let's list all the champions who are supposed to build Bami's Cinder and its upgrades:

* Tanks - Top: Malphite, Maokai, Ornn, Sion, Shen, Poppy
* Tanks - Jungle: Amumu, Sejuani, Nunu, Zac, Rammus, Gragas
* Fighters (mostly Juggernauts and junglers): Volibear, Dr. Mundo, Shyvana, Sett, Jarvan IV, Warwick, Skarner
* Cho'Gath (he's a Specialist, so not really bound to any class)
 
And here's an observation: Tanks almost never build anything else than Sunfire, the only ones who go Frostfire Gauntlet are Volibear and Cho'Gath, likewise for Turbo Chemtank which is Skarner's pick of choice. This proves the point that these items, while situationally viable, are not for Tanks, but other classes. Even the dedicated armor stackers Malphite and Rammus never really choose FG.

Frostfire Gauntlet is a great item for Cho'Gath, and Juggernauts like Shyvana or Volibear - champions who otherwise lack reliable CC in their kit.

Turbo Chemtank is a great item for Skarner, and some supports due to Shurelya being garbage.

**Both Gauntlet and Chemtank are just not made for tanks.** Tanks already have slows and engage in their kits, these effects are redundant with their spell patterns. FG and BC are neat for some offtanks, but mostly useless for true tanks.

#Why nerfing Sunfire wasn't enough

The problem with Sunfire isn't even that it's a specialized DPS item in a class that isn't supposed to be a main DPS dealer. The problem with Sunfire is that it's actually **too good of a generalist item**. It's equally good against all kinds of damage. Even if you need to specialize into a specific resist, **Sunfire+boots is a better choice than the resist-specific Mythic**. This is the other fundamental flaw of Gauntlet and Chemtank - they're awkwardly balanced between statline and effects, rarely ever optimal for the situation. Skarner purchases Chemtank despite the awful statline only because he wants the active all that much.

Think about it: **Even after the nerf** of Sunfire to 350 health, it's still a better item against magic damage than Frostfire Gauntlet (by 5 MR) and a better item against physical damage than Turbo Chemtank (by 5 armor). Sunfire will always remain the numbingly default option if this isn't addressed.

#Consider unifying defensive stats of all tank Mythics

This works in Mage Mythics. This works in AD Mythics. This works in Enchanter Mythics. The only outliers are sustain-providing ones (Riftmaker, Eclipse, Shieldbow). Establish a successful statline for the items, then make the players truly choose the unique effect of a specific Mythic.

For Tanks, this should be 400 Health, 30 Armor, 30 Magic Resist, 20 Ability Haste. Of course Gauntlet and Chemtank would need more powerful effects, then - but that's exactly the point. Effects that play into the tank fantasy of enduring damage, disabling opponents and protecting allies, not this ""mage bruiser"" DPS bullshit.

#Make Gauntlet and Chemtank unique effects more unique and impactful

Every Mythic item should change how you play the game, either adding something essential to your combo (Rocketbelt, Goredrinker, Duskblade, Harvester, Galeforce, Locket) or permanently enhancing your existing patterns (Mandate, Liandry's, Riftmaker, Krakenslayer, Triforce/Sunderer). Currently, tank Mythics don't really do that, mostly because they're doing a shit job at being Mythics for tanks. Gauntlet is a Juggernaut item and Chemtank is a bastard child of Shurelya's and old Randuin's.

Tank Mythics should assume that their user can already engage into the enemy (Vanguards) or is around the allies they want to protect (Wardens) and enhance the qualities they truly care about. Assume they have CC already and don't need the slows. Assume they want to get hit.

In comparison, other class Mythics make the user choose between the mobility&amp;burst, (anti-tank) DPS, or survivability. Let's try to follow that pattern here as well, but from the other side - tanks aren't supposed to be the ones dealing DPS or burst damage, but dealing WITH that damage. Consider the following:

* Frostfire Gauntlet becomes the anti-burst option. Think Malphite/Galio passive shield that serves as a soft taunt: while the shield holds, your basic attacks deal bonus on-hit damage. In tune with the item's name and theme, you choose between Physical or Magical shield by item toggle, which also switches between armor-scaling physical damage and MR-scaling magical damage, you get the point. It also plays into one of tank strengths: punishing enemies for stacking one type of damage.
* Sunfire due to its name and theme should remain the DPS option... but **stacking with enemy DPS instead**. Enemy team bought Liandry's? Perfect, you'll stack Sunfire in no time. You burn, they burn, it all burns. The Shurima Ascended theme makes it also a much better fit for %size passive.
* Turbo Chemtank can remain tied to mobility, but as we've discussed, only the likes of Skarner will utilize it as a main engage tool. It needs a secondary purpose as well in order to become a true tank item. Again, soft taunt - enemy team should feel encouraged to stop you and force you to finish your engage early.

#The Support Clause

The itemization landscape isn't complete without considering the tank Supports. At the moment some of them can opt for Chemtank as a possible purchase for the engage potential given the low appeal of Shurelya's. Long story short, Shurelya's needs a buff for low-income Supports to have a choice between more than one item; another concern is low power of post-nerf Knight's Vow and poor choice of 2300g support defensive items overall, but let's not jump ahead too far.

The weakness of Shurelya's, however, is part of the Chemtank problem - some supports like Blitzcrank or Tahm Kench can consider Chemtank for the engage potential, it's just so damn expensive. They would be pretty happy with Shurelya's if only it wasn't so horribly inefficient.

It took from minute 14:30 to minute 22:00 for me to load it back up, start league again and load into the game (I checked on the replay). I rushed to restart it and log back into the game, and we managed to win that game pretty easy, but I was marked as an AFK so I got -8LP (for a game that we WON, that I was there for the majority of it, the afk time was exactly what it took me to boot it back up).

Is there a point in logging back into a game if your PC crashes? Doesn't this feed negativity into the player base if your PC crashes?? ""Why would I bother logging back in if I'm going to get punished no matter what?"" is what I thought. Why bother rushing back if my team can win but it will still count as a defeat for me?

1. Probably getting reported/yelled at, if those things affect you.
2. LP loss no matter if you win or not.

Now Singed has always been countered hard by lifesteal/sustain mechanics. Now this is generally fine because heals are meant to counter DoT damage, but this preseason healing has been so present in every game, and so overturned that poison trail, his main damage dealing tool feels like it's just never going to do enough damage. 

[Take this clip for example](https://streamable.com/id047c). The enemy champions tanked almost my **entire** 25 second ultimate duration, strolling through poison trail, while healing hundreds of hp every few seconds. Sylas didn't even itemize for healing at all, building armor, and Wukong lost his lane heavily, while also having 0 magic resistance. I even had a demonic embrace. The crazy part was that I was pretty fed for a Singed at this stage in the game. Healing is just so strong that Signed and champs similar to him, like Morde, get gimped out of so many kills even when piloting their champs very well. 

I can back this up with stats:

[From Lolalytics: Singed's stats from patch 10.22 (final Season 10 patch)](https://i.imgur.com/tSKEb2h.png)

As we can see, at the end of Season 10, Singed's average kills per game was 4.35, and his max kill spree was 2.12. In addition, his average total damage was 18,108 damage per game.

[Also from Lolalytics: Singed's stats for the current patch 10.25 (Preseason 11)](https://i.imgur.com/Gtnn0NZ.png)

We can see here that Singed's average kills dropped to 3.92, max kill spree dropped to 1.82, and his average total damage dropped to 16.991. His winrate also dropped from 51.5% to 49%.

So not only did Singed lose a ton of damage per game, he also is getting less kills and is popping off in less games due to a lower killing spree. This is party due to DoT items being much weaker this season compared to old Rylais/Liandry combo, but also due to the huge amount of healing the game.

Singed and Morde are currently suffering hard from a lack of good itemization getting slapped by healing. This is not even a question of grievous wounds either. Singed is among the best applicators of grievous wounds in the game. Poison trail debuff lasts for 2 seconds, extending the duration of grievous wounds from 2 to 4, and Demonic ticks for 4 seconds extending the duration to 8 seconds. 

It's not really an issue with his kit either. I can still get into a teamfight just fine. I can still fling the right target and ground the right targest and still run around and spread my poison perfectly, but because of the healing enemy champions just don't die. It really sucks to pop ult ghost and Predator to run at the enemy carry, sidestep all of the enemy CCs, and get the perfect W + Fling combo only to see them get a massive shield from Shieldbow and start healing to full health in a few autos.

Items are also an issue because we were led to believe that there would be plenty of AP bruiser items but in reality there are only 3, rift demonic and rylais. Out of those 3, Riftmaker has been gutted for AP bruisers and Demonic doesn't apply enough damage. Rylais is very reliable but is not a damage dealing item as much as it is a utility item.

I'm trying to bring attention to this because the AP bruiser class is suffering hard right now. If you go on /r/singedmains the entire subreddit reads like a depression therapy session, and rightfully so. It sucks to main DoT champs right now.",2021-01-01 16:55:27

Although we got bored of playing the same champions so we started trying out other things to have fun. But I've lost all my rank, and now I'm back to bronze 2.

leagueoflegends,2021,1,"So a lot of people *think* they know the answer to all of the below, but there are so many contradicting opinions and riot responses that if anyone can actually try working out how all these systems work would be nice.

Dodging - Simple, 3 or 10 lp loss, your mmr is not impacted. Except riot have said dodging your provisional games CAN impact your mmr.

Remake - Presumed to not impact your mmr at all if you are not the afker, does the afker lose mmr? Can you remake hundreds of games down to iron without ever actually losing one? If not, is it just a bonus -15lp dodge if your jungler doesn't take smite or something to afk at start of the game.

Loss prevented - LP not lost, winning team gains half lp. MMR impact, who knows?

Loss mitigated - New system if someone on your team afks, you sometimes lose less LP, do you still lose the same mmr? Does the enemy gain the full MMR for a win?",2021-01-01 17:48:16

leagueoflegends,2021,1,"So I was playing Darius (Goredrinker, DD, Steraks) in an Aram with 4 adcs in my team (Graves, Ashe, Jhin &amp; Twitch) against Velkoz, Poke Varus and Jax (dont remember the other two). Because of their range I felt quite useless if I didnt have snowball up or they dodged it or i missed it. Other than Ashe R my Snowball into e was the only engage we had I felt. Early game I wasnt tanky enough to be focused  by all 5 enemies and im not good on Bruisers anyway (On SR I´m supp main and mostly play tanky engage Champs like Naut/leona and Amumu in jgl if I get filled). My 4 adcs managed to trade my death for 2 to 3 kills. So for our team these engages were fine but I wasnt doing particulary well gold wise. 

Some time later Jax came online (Triforce, BotrK and Steraks). He and Varus had the most kills and were the most threatening. One time when Jax was about the jump into the 4 adcs I had the option to snowball onto the Jax or onto the Varus. I chose the first to pull him away from the squishies. But after that a teammate why I´m focusing on the ""tank"" because ""it takes you forever to kill him"". He was ofc right - I couldnt kill him 1v1, but i thought maybe he can kill them 1v4 if they all get stunned by him. And I couldnt oneshot the Varus I felt. 

So - am I missing something or was he wrong there?

And: How does that translate to a teamfight in SR where there are 4 squishies and something like a Darius in a team and a diver in the enemy team? Ofc Darius (especially with Goredrinker) thrives when fighting in the midst of a lot of enemies because of q but unless he can 1v4/1v5 if the whole backline dies to the enemy diver it doesnt matter in the end. Just curious about your thoughts. 

&amp;#x200B;

Ofc I could have gone Aftershock and do the snowball into e play but I didnt want to play full tank (its aram...). We won the game in the end anyway so no hard feelings against my teammate.

what's reason LoL is still popular? not mentiong addiction; 2-3 million players every day

it's casual friendly but there are other casual games too and only minecraft and fortnite beats the numbers of LoL

so what's the secret of LoL? shuld i come back? i heard the game will be more broken than ever in s11 and it will be the worst season ever but even if the game gets worse every season it still stays popular; the reason cannot be just addiction",2021-01-01 18:11:52

leagueoflegends,2021,1,"So I have some thoughts. Let's say Thresh and Quinn were on the same team on Summoner's Rift and Thresh threw his lantern to Quinn to shield/bubble her during a heated fight with an enemy champion. Now let's say Quinn dashed towards the enemy champion using E while still being in the protective bubble/shield, by dashing to the enemy champion, she is literally in the enemy's face, so my question is this, since the souls are actively shielding her in a bubble during this time, what impact would it have on the enemy champion, when she is dashing right into them with E? Won't the shield/bubble (in theory) collide with the enemy champion that she is dashing to? What or how it would feel like being hit by the shield from the perspective of the champion that is fighting Quinn in this scenario? Would the shield/bubble make any sort of collision and/or impact with the enemy champion upon her dashing to said enemy? Of course I am not asking from a gameplay perspective, but rather trying to make sense of it from a lore perspective.",2021-01-01 19:31:17

Why this is a problem? Because healing/vamp/lifesteal items are good. They have things other than sustain on them, and are efficient items. Ravenous Hydra, for example, is 106% gold efficient. In addition to giving omnivamp to the user, it also provides waveclear. Blade of the Ruined King is almost always cost efficient, as the target needs to have 300 current health (for melees) or 400 (for rangeds) for it to become efficient; in addition to giving lifesteal, it also provides two powerful passives. It is a fantastic item for dueling.

Sustain items are probably items you would want to get even if they had no sustain at all. I am pretty sure a lot of champions would like to have waveclear or on-hit % current health damage. Not to mention, sustain is present in runes too.

Compare that to the Grievous Wounds items. For example... Morellonomicon allows you to inflict Grievous Wounds to enemies and... nothing else. It is a very cost inneficient item (you pay more for this item than what its stats are worth in gold). Chempunk Putrifier also only gives Grievous Wounds and nothing else, it is also a gold inneficient item; other than Grievous Wounds, it is just an inferior Black Cleaver.

If weren't for the excessive sustain, no one would even bother with those items.

Before the pre season, those items used to have good things for them other than Grievous Wounds. For example, Mortal Reminder had a lot of armor penetration (helping you combat tanks), Morellonomicon had flat magic penetration to help you with bursting enemies, and Thornmail had a higher amount of reflected damage.

Those issues are made even worse by the fact that, thanks to healing being omnipresent, you still have to purchase those items every game. Imagine if, for example, every game had a champ with suppression. It would be shitty because QSS and its upgrades are actually mediocre items and they are only purchased to counter suppression. The difference is, because suppression is not omnipresent, it is not that much a problem if once every 10 games, you have to purchase it. Now imagine if every game you had to purchase an extremely inneficient item to counter something that is supposed to not be in every battle. That is what Grievous Wounds items feel like.

To solve this problem, Riot has three options:

* Reduce the healing on items and runes, so that Grievous Wounds become situtional purchases (as they should be).
* Remove Grievous Wounds, remove all current Grievous Wounds items except Thornmail (which should then be reverted to its 5.16 version), and balance all existing sustain around it not existing.
* Buff Grievous Wounds items, either by giving them better stats, or by making them have other good passives, so that they aren't terrible purchases on their own.",2021-01-01 20:49:21

leagueoflegends,2021,1,"league is too big to die on its own , but when it finally does , it will be due to devs constantly trying to one up each other . honestly at times it feels like there is an internal competition at riot to see who can fuck up the game the hardest and get away with it . its always the excuse of "" we are just a small slice of the player base"" , which is true  , but you telling me everyone in KR and China enjoy this excessive healing and one shotting ? the answer is no . one quick look at their posts and you will realize that this kind of league of legends (everything turned up to 11) is disliked by almost everyone . the correct step from here is actually acknowledge this is an issue , rather than doubling down on a mistake and force everyone to embrace this state of game . league loses a huge chunk of its complexity and gameplay when everything one shots everything ... if only more devs were like riot gortok. when him and his team realized the new ranked system they worked on for 2 years wasnt working well with the player base , he didnt say we worked 2 years on it so shove it down their throat and let them cope with it . instead , gortok and his team reverted everything back ... those are the true devs at riot that keep this ship afloat , and i hope these younger devs who constantly battle on reddit posts learn a thing or two from them .

leagueoflegends,2021,1,"So, we have all complained about master yi in the past at least once. Whether it's funnel or just yi dealing 70% true damage to a tank, we all have been there. But during those times, he was punishable by good dps comps that just kill him, point and click cc you can use after he gets out of q or even a skillshot cc that you land. Like he always was a scary force but at least he ran at you q'd your spell and then aa you to death.

Lehality duskblade/collector/navori yi is something else though. I can't say that he is like grossly overpowered or smth like that. He has his weakness which is earlygame but if he somehow gets out of it ahead (for example getting a single kill out of a lost dragon fight) he just starts doing disgusting shit. First: duskblade. Due to this item he has the ability to go invisible after killing your adc. Like i get it the item is not grossly op but combined with his q its just aids. He spends way too much time untargetable. I know that you can hit him while he's invisible but he can run away from where the target died and also some of his skins have really bad visual clarity of where he exactly ends up after his q. Also some abilities are targeted and you can't gold card a yi or liss ult him while he is invis.

Duskblade wouldn't be such a problen if it weren't for navori and collector though. Collector just gives him the stats needed to oneshot people but navori is a whole different level of broken on him. When he hits this item, he starts spending half of the fights in his q. It's frustrating and really hard to play against and I really hope something is done about lethality yi.

To be honest, my best bet would be just gutting his ad and crit scaling and maybe reverting some of his older nerfs to his onhit build which is not as strong anymore.",2021-01-01 21:56:49

What is even more annoying is sometimes even if you cast the skill after dashing with the snowball you will still use your aa on the target you dashed to without giving a command for it. 

What I noticed is your character always tries to aa the target you dashed to even if aa is off but you can cancel it with movement commands if the aa isn't instant like hecarim or Ekko's case.

leagueoflegends,2021,1,"Yes, damage is crazy high, and healing is in an arms race against it. But I don’t know why Riot is so hesitant to give shields the same treatment that healing is getting. For example, there isn’t a single shield item that scales with AP, and Seraph’s shield was removed and even that scaled with mana (RIP my sweet prince).

I feel like maybe shields can bring a dynamic that’s more interactive and fun to play with/against in light of the current complaints against all the sources of healing in the game, as shields can be an item active, meaning it takes some decision making rather than functioning passively like many sources of healing in the game, as well as offering a solution to the burst-heal dichotomy since shields can go beyond max hp.

Shields also decay, so there’s some potential interactions with CC. I think the current issue with shields in the game so far is that the lack of scaling makes it so carries can’t rely on shielding to stay alive. I can see potential counterarguments being Ardent Censer meta (although that’s different, since the item doesn’t provide a shield itself) and that scaling shields make a snowballing carry too hard to shut down, although healing kind of has the same problem and shields need to actually be consciously used (snowballing carries can just stat check with all the healing).

leagueoflegends,2021,1,"No matter how many MVPs you get on [op.gg](https://op.gg) you will never ever be capable of making people understand that low-elo is actually a problem at the moment. I have currently been duo que playing in silver as a plat 1 probably diamond level player. It is nearly impossible despite the amount of carries and MVPs as well as just over all great plays to carry the people who are stuck in the elo that they are in thus dragging down experienced players  and causing many players to give up on their attempts at climbing to a serious level due to the players around them. If you are to look at my account there are a few winstreaks where I either had carried or had normal players and they allowed me to play normally which is great in low-elo, however after a while it gets nearly impossible when you get matched with people who have no experience in jungle with an autofill. Honestly if you are auto-filling people in low-elo there is nearly no chance for any player to get better. The concept of putting people into situations that they are incapable of understanding blows my mind and it is an awful idea.  


This is why I am proposing that in low-elo there are higher que timers to put people in the roles that they are actually playing as their dominant role. If a person is willingly putting themselves in the jungle they most likely have a concept of how it works to make it atleast somewhat fair; however, putting low-elo players in an autofilled role of jungle is just unfair to them and the people that are trying to climb. There is no full way to notice that a player is autofilled unless you look them up and with an older generation computer this is nearly impossible due to my computer just not being fast enough nor good enough to handle that many apps open at once due to advertisements. This is my personal change that I would make to solo-que because being in a lane practice makes perfect and the same thing goes for being a jungler.  


This is one of my experiences of a player who was bronze I and had a record of 4-17 and then got autofilled jungle for his FIRST time might I add. No experience playing jungle ever and clearly a new player. The game was over as soon as it started with AMUMU BTW being down 3 levels and 40 cs with 0 ganks completed. Who in their mind is going to not abuse the amumu being awful? It's causing solo-que to be completely based off of everyone's solo experience rather than being the ""team game"" that everyone tries to cover the problem with. There are real problems besides this game being a team game as well as some problems with the client that can be fixed with minor fixes. I feel as though my computer science major speaks for itself when I say I can see the problems in the client as well as the games development due to being a gamer for nearly 10 years strong.   


To continue with the problem at hand there are many different kinds of ways to be toxic and there is not enough management on the end of fixing the banning problem that soft inters and snowflakes can easily dodge with being a quiet nuisance to the game and or ruining everyone else experience over their own mentality. I feel as though games with KDA's lower than .5 should be looked at in everyone instance comparatively to their other games. In most instances where games end early there  are multiple people with bad KDR's and that is a simple solution to getting rid of the players who do not ""try to win"" in ranked games. The concept of intentionally feeding has been thrown around with a grain of salt with many different variations of intensity and this has caused the lower intensities to undergo no punishment. Even if  people do not agree there should be the same punishment there should be some punishment to prevent people from repeat offending.

leagueoflegends,2021,1,"Rocketbelt isn't Harvester, Prowler's isn't duskblade, stridebreaker isn't goredrinker, yet riot is balancing their damage together. 

To me, the most ridiculous is prowler's vs duskblade. One is on short cooldown, provides a bit of utility and offers resets with much bigger utility, the other has long ass cooldown, on paper great but in reality very clunky dash, and a damage amp. When those two effects have same damage, duskblade will always be much better. Prowler's, as the premiere single target assassin item, should have much bigger upfront damage than the utility oriented duskblade, that has resets and much shorter cd.

Harvester and rocketbelt are a lot closer, most champs that use one can relatively well use the other, on some it's even just a preference. Still, as rocketbelt is much more utility oriented than harvester, that is just ""more damage"", I think harvester should have slightly bigger damage, or at least the scaling.

Between gore and stride, I think stridebreaker should have bigger damage scaling, or scale some other part of the active off ad. Currently both share the same damage and damage scaling, but goredrinker gets heal scaling with missing health and ad, which is incredibly strong compared to stridebreaker with fixed dash and slow.

I can perhaps understand the two ap items, as a lot of champions can use both, so riot has good data on their performance.

Like obviously getting starved out is bad and you always melt if you're behind but I don't really feel like I'm any more or less tanky in games past a certain point in the midgame even when I'm a full item ahead of carries. 

Which isn't to say that things are unbalanced and there are champs like Cho or Sion who can still become crazy tanky because of their kit. But I find that past two items, it doesn't really matter what I build because the health/resistances feel pretty much irrelevant and it's more the passives/kit that matters. I guess cause so much is %hp true damage now that you die in the same amount of time now regardless of whether you have 100 armour / 2,000hp or 150 armour / 3,000hp

leagueoflegends,2021,1,"Like, I don't understand how they are allowed to exist in the game in the state that they are. There's just no counterplay at all to their overloaded kits and every game ends up feeling like you're getting punished just for existing.

It's honestly baffling to me how Riot hasn't addressed this yet. There game simply becomes unfun whenever a champion like that gets picked as it forces the entire match to revolve around their pick.

This ends up creating a pretty toxic experience for the 9 other players, players who often just want to play a game and have fun with their silly, yet balanced picks, because some random tryhard just wants to pick the bullshit champ and run over everyone with their over-the-top and uninteractive play pattern.

It's honestly kind of disgusting that these abominations are allowed to remain the way that they are for some many years just because they sell a shitton of skins while all sucking all the fun out of the game.

And as if that wasn't enough, then we get a whole bunch of new and old overpowered items that are simply broken by design and creates a pretty untolerable experience for most people.

But still, the one thing I just can't stand is when some random ass redditors come into these threads and start throwing out buzzwords like ""splitpusher"" or ""counter-matchup"" that don't mean anything but makes them sound smart to the average reader.",2021-01-02 00:34:10

leagueoflegends,2021,1,Hey reddit. I've noticed that there has been a lot of negativity in this subreddit but honestly I've found this years changes more on the positive side for me. I'm an ADC main and for the past 2 years I haven't had as good of an experience with ADC as I have now. This new item Galeforce lets me play ADC much better than I used to. I don't know if its because my positioning is bad or something else but that extra flash and the movement speed you get from the mythic passive is helping me a lot. I don't know how to explain it but it just feels like I'm actually playing a role where I impact the game more. I feel like a very squishy yet slippery and fast moving champion that does damage. I feel like ADC should've always been like this. Characters that get killed easily but are very quick and deal damage. I'm loving this change so much that I haven't really taken a break from league yet. I know many people probably don't agree with me and think the item is useless but I'm honestly loving it and I'm glad riot is giving us ADC's more options for our build path.,2021-01-02 01:41:58

Anyway off topic I was worried about sucking so much it would turn me away from the game but I feel like I'm currently doing alright, I've had games where I've carried, where I've comeback from behind to carry and gotten destroyed. I've been watching videos on marco on when the best time is to recall and the macro stuff in mid game when everyone is normally roaming as that's where I seem to fall off. I said in the other post I feel bad about not hitting 10cs per min but got told it's unlikely anyone will hit it normally (other than pros of course). But I just checked my [OP.GG](https://OP.GG) ([https://euw.op.gg/summoner/userName=ZakWardyy](https://euw.op.gg/summoner/userName=ZakWardyy)) and this is the avg cs I put up now is it good or could I be better because sometimes I get so worried about missing cs it affects me through out the game as I'm always tabbing to see my other laners and teammates to compair them to mine. Sorry for the long post I don't want my anxitiy to ruin what could become the role for me.

leagueoflegends,2021,1,"You know, meaning his gameplay would either revolve around basic attack or be in-between that and ability usage.

For example:

Yi focuses around autos, since two of his abilities make his auto job better with a gap closer, and a true damage buff.

While Wukong is a bit in between, needing to use abilities as part of his damage output with his autos being the 2nd half of his damage, stuff like that (I think, not sure if that’s true in the case of Wukong).

Or maybe needing abilities to do most of the job despite autos being the main damage dealer of the kit.

In the case of Udyr, if there is one thing besides his animal stances that people would like to have in a rework, it’ll be his auto attacking focused style.

But what kind though?

leagueoflegends,2021,1,"I have been playing a lot of Nexus Blitz lately to grind out the event pass and overall I'd say I really enjoy it as a more casual game mode where I can actually play the champs I want. However, even in its latest iteration it still has huge problems that Riot for some reason has done nothing about since the last time it's been around.

&amp;#x200B;

* The system that is supposed to balance where events happen still doesn't work. Sometimes a team is barely behind and the event starts in their jungle, sometimes a team is even ahead and the battle royale ends in front of their guardian, etc. Honestly  they could just make the events always happen in the middle of the map, cause I don't think it's possible to balance gold lead vs event location properly.
* The Yordle events are bullshit and need to go. They always wander off into one or the other team's jungle or under their tower and 90% of the time that just means that team wins that event. Getting gold for hitting is also really stupid when teams have high DPS champs that can quickly (solo) kill the Yordle and get 5k gold for it.
* The event buffs are very unbalanced between each other.  Some, like the Blitzcrank hooks, are borderline useless, while Elder and Ocean Soul provide a huge advantage and are also extremely unfun to play against. This is especially frustrating in combination with unfair event spawns.
* This is somewhat subjective but to me lane feels way stronger than jungle. In lane you actually get to fight your opponent and try to get a lead, while in jungle you're stuck clearing camps for 2 minutes until you maybe contest red or scuttle (though I have never had a fun fight over red buff when I played jungle and scuttle is really about whose lanes are winning). Ganking also doesn't feel very good, as a laner you ward one bush and because lanes are so short you're basically ungankable unless you're getting tower-dived. There are also no significant objectives to contest as jungler except herald which usually doesn't spawn until one team has basically won.

&amp;#x200B;

I think if these issues are fixed Nexus Blitz could become a really good casual game mode that doesn't get old as quickly as URF.",2021-01-02 04:54:04

leagueoflegends,2021,1,So I have been going through the grind of unlocking characters and I have unlocked like 35 so far? Anyway my question is who should I prioritize? Should I just buy whoever I have the shards for or should I buy based on the meta or some other factor? I main mid and supp secondary. Thank you!,2021-01-02 05:24:48

leagueoflegends,2021,1,"am not going to lie I was one of the people that said he was bad when he first came out

now? my goodness lmfao. time your knock up with your R. literally perma CC death, its like two yasuo ults where he gets to land autos while your also cced. twice except he does a lot more damage. hes absolutely too strong at the moment lol. you can't even itemize against him because of Kraken slayer if your a squishy. and he does a decent chunk of magic damage

its quite incredible how oppressive his E is and how good in all situation it is. I remember when they were in the champion spotlight saying you shouldn't use it if your gonna get a bad trade, but hell nah, if hes gonna lose a trade, he will just use his E to get away and wait for his cooldowns to come back up 

the move speed on his E insane, and the amount of damage this champion does from basically everything is insane, get perma cc aoe killed by a hyper carry. literal aids atm thats am gonna start to perma ban

people have figured out how to play him and layer his CC. I don't think a hypr carry should be as strong as he is, his attack speed is bonkers he literally kills people by using R to get near them and just destroys them before his E even procs.

literally getting one comboed by a 1 item yone early game is silly. his damage is too high",2021-01-02 05:32:51

I also just generally like mixing up emotes that 'serve the same purpose' like d'pengu and animated d'pengu. ATM the system is messy with rows of 4 emotes and with no options for preference clarity.

In a way, I kind of want to make her mostly different just so she can STAND OUT from her KDA counterpart, just like how the other 4 (Ahri, Evelynn, Akali and Kai'sa) are different from their KDA counterparts, with the simple similarity being that she is a Singer of something.

leagueoflegends,2021,1,"Hey Guys,

Personally, I don't really like Kog'Maw's passive. Here's a replacement I thought of (his old passive would be removed).

**Passive:**

1. Each of Kog'Maw's AOE abilities and auto attacks applies a stack to all champions hit. Each of Kog'Maw's single-target abilities applies two stacks to all champions hit. Each target can have up to 4 stacks.
2. *(Hidden)* Continuing to auto attack or use abilities on the target will prolong the duration of the 4 stack by 1 second.
3. Kog'maw takes 4-8% (scaling on level) reduced damage from the bearer of each stack, up to a maximum of 16-32%. The stacks will last for 3 seconds. 
4. Once a target reaches 4 stacks for the first time in (10-5 seconds, scaling based on level, affected by CD reduction), the target takes a moderate amount of true damage over 5 seconds.

I'm just trying to make him do a tiny bit more damage while being slightly more tanky, but I don't know how good this would be.

Besides his play rate at pro play is still very high as the only tank in the top lane being picked, that alone says enough. He just deals way too much dmg for a tank.

His Q has an AD ratio of 110% (TAD) +120 base dmg.

And his W deals 16% of a target's max HP on a 10 second cooldown at max rank. Add Ability Haste to that which is in his core build, and it's on roughly a 6 second cooldown. 16% a target's max HP on a 6 second cooldown while building FULL TANK, and this isn't taking into consideration his other abilities that also deal tons of dmg.

Well it never really mattered to me since no matter what do I do I'm still bronze and therefore suck at the game. Like I actually can't comprehend being in the bottom 20 percent, not even average?

Others say its because  u play with friends

Most of the times I play with my other friend but together we have literally like a 20 percent win rate, losing the majority of the time, most of the times being our own fault, the game is sometimes actually damaging out friendship.

Sometimes it feels like the game is a burden, I'm a high school student with tons of schoolwork and activities to complete. Yet every time I have free time league is always on the top of my list.

leagueoflegends,2021,1,"Ok, so I'm fairly certain, like at least to me its been almost confirmed, that the next champion released to League is gonna be the Ruined King. At the very least, the only champion so far who's been teased and not released. The jungling skirmisher. I'd go into why but I wrote this idea before and its a lot of writing and I don't wanna add even more.

Anyway, I decided to write down an idea I had for his kit, based on him being a jungler, a skirmisher and some of the stuff surrounding him (BorK, the Shadow Isles, the Ruination, stuff like that). Note that I'm not experienced in coming up with these sorts of things so yeah

\-

Passive: Despair of the Ruined King

Cooldown: 30 seconds

Periodically, TRK’s third consecutive basic attack deals (+40% AP) **bonus** magic damage. If *Despair of the Ruined King* targets a champion or monster, it will also slow the target by 10% (+3% per 100 AP), and reduce their resistances by 10% for 3 seconds, healing by the amount of resistances reduced.

Note: If the third attack triggers Blade of the Ruined King’s Siphon, then the slows will stack and the movement speed will be increased. This won’t work on any other item though.

Q Ability: Cursed Decree

Cast Time: 0.5 seconds, Cost: 50/55/60/65/70 Mana, Cooldown: 12/11/10/9/8 seconds

TRK thrusts his sword forward, dealing (100% **total** AD) physical damage to all enemies hit. The sword will also deal (40% AP) **bonus** damage, apply on-hit effects to and stun for 0.5 seconds the first enemy hit. 

W Ability: Mist-Veiled Swipe

Cost: 40 mana, Cooldown: 8/7/6/5/4 seconds

TRK’s next basic attack cleaves an area in front of him, dealing 20/30/40/50/60 (+40% AP) **bonus** magic damage to the target and 40/50/60/70/80 (+60% AP) magic damage to any other enemy in range. If *Mist-Veiled Swipe* targets a monster, its cool down is reduced to 2 seconds. *Mist-Veiled Swipe* resets TRK’s basic attack timer and applies on-hit effects.

E Ability: Royal Shroud

Cast Time: 1 second, Cost: 75/80/85/90/95 mana, Cooldown: 20/18/16/14/12 seconds

TRK envelops himself in mist, reducing the damage he takes by (10%/15%/20%/25%/30%) and increasing his movement speed by (11%/16%/21%/26%/31%) for 6 seconds. TRK’s next ability or basic attack during *Royal Shroud* will deal (30% AP) **bonus** magic damage but end the effect early.

*Royal Shroud* can be recast during its effect.

**Recast:** RTK will dash to the target location, becoming temporarily unstoppable until the dash has finished.

Ultimate: Ruination

Cast Time: 1 second, Cost: 100 mana, Cooldown: 160/140/120 seconds

TRK smashes his sword into the ground, dealing 100/200/300 (+80% AP) magic damage to all enemies around him and 50/100/150 (+50% **bonus** AD) **bonus** physical damage at the epicentre.

For the next 10 seconds, the mist will form in the damaging area, dealing 20/35/40 (+15% AP) magic damage per second to all enemies hit and healing him for the same amount, reduced by 90% against minions and monsters. If TRK scores a takedown during *Ruination*, he will gain 10% bonus damage to his basic attacks and abilities, increasing with each take down for up to 50% for 5 takedowns.",2021-01-02 12:22:58

leagueoflegends,2021,1,"Quick intro: I would like to thank everybody who has taken the time to give feedback on my rework posts (and those who will in the future). Somehow, I've managed to reach my ^(thirtieth)  kit iteration, and the thoughtful responses I've received helped me hit that milestone. 

I have made a [very detailed FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/user/HardstuckPlasticV/comments/j9wrhu/ryze_rework_faqs/). It's got a lot of important context that I've cut out so that this post is digestible. Take a look if you have any questions, there's a decent chance it's already addressed there. Now, onto the kit: 

&amp;#x200B;

\---------------------------

**TLDR:** Basic ability mana scalings are removed and replaced with non-damage scalings. Ryze has a new passive, The Scroll, which stores damage to be converted into shields. The rune charge system is removed, but Q resets remain. EW now slows, and EWQ roots. Autospread is removed and WE spreads flux. W can refund mana when it kills a minion. Realm Warp is removed and replaced with a new Desperate Power ultimate.

&amp;#x200B;

\----------------------------------

# Mana Scalings Changes

&amp;#x200B;

\- RUNIC RESHUFFLING: Existing basic ability mana scalings and Arcane Mastery are removed.

&amp;#x200B;

\-------------------

# Passive: The Scroll

&amp;#x200B;

\- MAGIC BATTERY: Ryze stores 30% of pre-mitigation damage from enemy Champions in The Scroll, up to \[200-700 + 20% bonus mana\]. Only damage to Ryze's health counts, not shields.

&amp;#x200B;

Overload casts drain \[40-140 + 4% bonus mana\] if available to give a 2-second decaying shield for the same amount.

&amp;#x200B;

Consecutive Overloads (less than 2 seconds apart) remove &amp; refresh this shield, but only for half value (the drain is not halved).

&amp;#x200B;

Stored damage decays while out of combat with champions (full -&gt; zero in 30 seconds).

&amp;#x200B;

[5 bars \(5 shields\) is the maximum that can be stored. My FAQ \(linked at the bottom\) has a more in-depth explanation of my reasoning behind this mechanic. I think it's better structured to create openings for opponents \(especially in lane trading\) and work more intuitively.](https://preview.redd.it/n0rj6uk9xw861.png?width=1199&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=421c0744dbad9fe2d31288ad238f43ab99a5cab5)

&amp;#x200B;

\------------------

# Q: Overload

&amp;#x200B;

\- RUNIC DISCHARGE: Rune charge system is removed. Cooldown resets remain.

&amp;#x200B;

\- OVERLOADED: Damage increased to \[80/110/140/170/200 + 55% AP\]. Ult-scaling bonuses are removed.

&amp;#x200B;

\------------------

# W: Unstable Flux / Prison Flux

&amp;#x200B;

\- Renamed to ""Unstable Flux"". It still slows by 35%, and the damage is dealt as a DoT.

&amp;#x200B;

\- MACHINE GUN: Cooldown reduced by 2 (11/10/9/8/7).

&amp;#x200B;

\- MINION SLAYER: If Unstable Flux kills a minion, \[mana cost + 60-160 mana\] is restored. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

[Skilled players should be able to punish this more effectively by abusing the trade-offs from a \\""W investment\\"". At the same time, the skill gap from proper mana management should decrease, helping to make Ryze more approachable \(a common rework goal\). The reduced mana reliance should help open up new build paths and laning strategies. The mana restoration is WIP, let me know what you think about that number \(I'm mostly worried about the early lane\). ](https://preview.redd.it/wh86wv0ezw861.png?width=572&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=08cdb6bb1c2e101f13371c7866ec4c7d7f6b42c7)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\- SPELL SPLIT: When Unstable Flux is cast on Spell Flux (EW), it splits to create ""Prison Flux"" and slows by 35%. Overload hitting Prison Flux (EWQ) roots the target for 1.5 seconds.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

[My FAQ has some context, as well as responses for multiple common arguments. Overall, the intent is to reduce reliability. This adds vulnerabilities and limits CC setups that are disproportionately valuable for coordinated teams. I think there are also clarity improvements; the tradeoffs provide obvious weaknesses to play around, and the design standardizes \\""enemy-facing\\"" combos loading their effects onto Q hits \(IMO this is also a more satisfying root structure\).](https://preview.redd.it/1josdjoqxw861.png?width=1140&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=aa677dfe849516f473ca2fa2c175a77443bdb6d6)

&amp;#x200B;

\----------------------

# E: Spell Flux

&amp;#x200B;

\- LIKE BUTTER: Spell Flux spreads when cast on Unstable Flux (WE). This consumes W, removing the slow.

&amp;#x200B;

\- MACHINE-GUN: Cooldown reduced by 0.25 (3/2.75/2.5/2.25/2).

&amp;#x200B;

\- FLUX THEM UP: Spell Flux deals \[35/45/55/65/75 + 20% AP\] damage (including spreads). This damage is dealt again when Overload consumes Spell Flux. The consumption ratio increases to 40% at 200 AP and 60% at 300 AP (see FAQ section 8). 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

[This changes the W combo trade-offs to include waveclear and teamfight AoE. Ryze can no longer waveclear while conserving his root; he must \\""expose\\"" himself to push quickly or maximize teamfight damage. This should help limit his push priority, especially when skilled opponents recognize and punish these windows. I tried to find a replacement combo for EEQ, but I felt like I was overcomplicating things for no benefit. This mechanic \(specifically, the flux consumption damage\) is a useful lever to help balance glass cannon builds separately.](https://preview.redd.it/7sea4b0vxw861.png?width=1208&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=050c998d0719581d084cd6119f369fb3c426aade)

&amp;#x200B;

\---------------------

# R: Desperate Power

&amp;#x200B;

\- LET'S (NOT) GO: Realm Warp removed.

&amp;#x200B;

\---

**PASSIVE**

&amp;#x200B;

\- GET OVER HERE: Ryze gains \[20% + 2% bonus mana, capped at 40%\] movespeed for 3 seconds towards visible enemy champions that damage him from outside Overload's range. This damage is stored in The Scroll with 100% efficiency.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

[I think that this Ryze \(in terms of his \\""threat profile\\""\) is like a juggernaut. He doesn't have good tools to take the initiative and engage fights, but he's extremely dangerous to face in the middle of combat with his high durability and consistent damage. This mechanic helps Ryze enter those fights once opponents initiate. I expect that this will be quite useful in lane against artillery mages, and it should also help vs. long-ranged backline threats in teamfights. Since I've added many weaknesses in the kit, I feel like there's enough room in the power budget to give Ryze this boost and help him function more effectively. In my FAQ, I explain why I think this is healthier than a \\""generic\\"" speed boost for the kit.](https://preview.redd.it/6jc553n4yw861.png?width=931&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2248491955ff5b71fda21c38138aeccd4cad3a76)

&amp;#x200B;

\---

**ACTIVE**

&amp;#x200B;

\- This has a (150/120/90) second cooldown and a (6/9/12) second duration.

&amp;#x200B;

\- KEEP YOUR DISTANCE: Enemies in melee range (&lt;250) lose up to 20/25/30% magic resistance over 2 seconds.

&amp;#x200B;

\- THIS ENDS BADLY: The ultimate passive speed boost is applied at half strength to attacks outside 250 range. Charge efficiency is not increased. 

&amp;#x200B;

[Enjoy my editing masterpiece. I've been struggling with this part of the kit. I want mechanics that \\""feel powerful\\"", but the base kit should have enough power \(especially with the shielding\) that I want to be very conservative with the ult. The MR reduction is VFX-dependent, but it shouldn't be too difficult to make it satisfying. Movement speed is also a very \\""strong-feeling\\"" buff. The two degrees of speed may seem a bit overcomplicated, but it really just boils down to Ryze running at people that attack him. If they're far away, he runs faster. If they're close, he runs slower. I've been experimenting with a lot of mechanics, so let me know if you think there's a better alternative to fit my goal. ](https://preview.redd.it/apkne14dyw861.png?width=1677&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=db179e03c91cfc12842427c1592c6dff2aef0207)

&amp;#x200B;

\- PROTECT THE SCROLL: If Ryze takes fatal damage, he spends half of his Scroll charge to regain 50% of his health and remain active. There is a 1.5-second post-death animation. Ryze dies if his HP hits zero or after (5/6/7) seconds.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

[I've put my explanation for this mechanic in the FAQ. You might find it strange and\/or \\""wrong\\"" at first, but I think that there is a good basis in Ryze's lore. Overall, I think this serves its purpose as a mechanic that feels impactful without affecting the power budget too much \(at least, not for players that respect it and properly shut Ryze down\). Ryze will keep his ultimate buffs during this time.](https://preview.redd.it/x5gigg753x861.png?width=1536&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=df051ca7634dbf25df80525d1ee4caa24deafeaf)

&amp;#x200B;

\- OUT OF JUICE: Ryze cannot use The Scroll for 6 seconds when the ult finishes. Any remaining charge dissipates.

leagueoflegends,2021,1,"So this is probably asked a billion times already but can't find it myself. I'm playing Wild Rift (have played League a few years ago but just got back into it).

Played Master Yi for the first time and my match stats were 12-1-2, 5-0-1, 17-4-4.

Started learning Akali after getting slammed in lane to better understand her and I got: 5-7-4, 4-5-2, 4-6-1.

Either I was playing in very amateur games or it seems Master Yi is the easiest champion in the world as it's essentially a Q teleport and you've got a kill if they're alone. 

With Akali it feels much more difficult and that it'll take me hundreds of games to get to similar stats as I've had for Yi in my very first games playing him.

I read that Akali has a large skill ceiling but are we really saying that Yi cannot be played to be as useful in high-end competitive play? 

Feeling like learning and losing with Akali for hundreds of games is a waste of time if I can just be effective from my first game with Yi and feeling like I wish they'd make Yi a little more difficult to play",2021-01-02 14:31:17

My friend is having issues when casting abilities.
He presses the key and only a couple seconds later casts it in game. Anyone experiencing the same issues? Is there a solution to this problem?",2021-01-02 14:41:52
leagueoflegends,2021,1,"The idea is to increase the effective mmr of people who are in a premade to account for the fact that they will be coordinated and therefor getting more value from their abilities (which is effectively indistinguishable from having a higher mmr). This realization is what has driven the following adjustment.

Premade group member's mmr= solo queue mmr + ß\_N(group size dependant) + ß\_M(exists only if there are other premades in the group like 2+2+1 or 2+3)

where ß= C(N\^2)/5 +1 and N= the number of people in the premade and C is an arbitrary constant.

These are the values of ß for each premade size:

ß\_2 = C(1,8)

ß\_3 = C(2,8)

ß\_4 = C(4,2)

ß\_5 = C(6)

This means that ß grows quasi-lineally with premade size:

ß\_3/ß\_2 = 1,5555

ß\_4/ß\_3 = 1,5

ß\_5/ß\_4 = 1,42

These are the values of the 5 man premade compared to the others:

ß\_5/ß\_2 = 3,33333

ß\_5/ß\_3 = 2,14

ß\_5/ß\_4 = 1,42

In the case of mixed premades such as 2+2+1 and 3+2, where M= the size of the other premade in the group, the values for groups with more than one premade are like this:

2+2+1= ß\_2 + ß\_2 = C(3,6)

3+2= ß\_3 + ß\_2 = C(4,6)

The value of the 5man premade compared to the values of the combined premades:

ß\_5/(2+2+1) = 1,66666

ß\_5/(3+2) = 1,3

The value of a 4 man premade compared with combined premades:

ß\_4/(2+2+1) = 1,1666666

ß\_4/(3+2) = 0,913  =&gt; (3+2)/ß\_4 = 1,095

The value of a 3 man premade compared with combined premades:

ß\_3/(2+2+1) = 0,77777  =&gt; (2+2+1)/ß\_3 = 1,28

ß\_3/(3+2) = 0,6 =&gt; (3+2)/ß\_3 = 1,666666

The value of a 2 man premade compared with combined premades:

ß\_2/(2+2+1) = 0,5  =&gt; (2+2+1)/ß\_2 = 2

ß\_2/(3+2) = 0,39  =&gt; (3+2)/ß\_2 = 2,56

The comparison between the values of both combined premades:

(3+2)/(2+2+1) = 1,277777

Commentary:

This is just a first approximation to get the perfect equation. To advance this further i would need to get the winrates of all premade sizes vs all premade sizes and so i would adjust the ratios between the values--if needed--and i would be able to get the value of the constant C for the game of LOL. This is to say that this formula can be used to adjust the mmr inside of any 5v5 game and C is specific to each game and, probably, depends on time in some measure (under the assumption that the playerbase's average experience vs premades increases with time).

The constant C must be finely tuned with the help of said statistics so that the win rates for all matchups (i.e. 5man vs full solo queue or 3+2 vs duo queue or any other matchup) are as close to 50% as possible.

After adjusting the players' mmr using the here described method, one is to apply to it the common Glicko RD (rating deviation) treatment and you have then the tools to make balanced matches which result in less player frustration even with premades.

All the ratios between all values have been calculated based only on player perception of what is stronger than what and has no statistical foundation whatsoever. It would be fantastic to get the statistics to be able to make this equation exactly but, even with the inexactitude caused by the lack thereof, the incorporation of this adjustment to the current Glicko mmr system represents an upgrade in match making exactitude for any 5v5 game.",2021-01-02 14:44:49

leagueoflegends,2021,1,"I have thought about it a little bit for some time now. Before I have thought that Panth is one of the best reworks done so far because how they approached it and kept every single ability the same with just adjustment to Q since that was the root of all evil when it comes to old pantheon and gave him very interesting mechanic on E that gave completely perfect sense ( thematically ) and above all gave him passive that gives depth to his playstyle. And the thing is, does it really? Does the passive give him depth to be interactive and nonbinary character so that he isnt either super viable or waste of time?

They made his Q a skill shot, thats good and that already made his rework success since he isnt oppressive. But what about his plain and repetitive trade patter, get 5 stacks, use W, hit twice, use Q use E and back or use E and then Q ( based on enemy ).

I play panth in JG where some thing like whether champ is straightforward or is skill expressive doesnt matter a lot and when he could use E for towerdives, it made completely sense to make him into jungler since he was used as JG even before with his point and click stun and map control ult. But now that riot changed his E and showed that they want him primarly as toplaner, what do you think about him as design? Do you also think that there should be changes to shift or encourage shift of playstyles into different variations?",2021-01-02 15:38:49

leagueoflegends,2021,1,"Every kit-healing reliant champ in the game is doing poorly with the sole exception of champs who have abilities that read ""increase self healing by 100%"", which basically just means ""ignore grievous wounds"". Something needs to be done about this. These champs were balanced around less accessible 40% grievous wounds and now can't even close to compete with the champs who just heal from items bc for champs like zac, vlad, mundo, illaoi, and soraka you now just delete them from the game as soon as you get the upgraded grievous item or take ignite (who the fuck made ignite 60% gw lvl 1? Like at least make it scaling) as it invalidates their entire kits. In contrast the champs who abuse healing items, don't care all that much about 60% gw because they have working kits that don't depend on healing to function.

Multiple suggestions to fix this have been given: 

&amp;#x200B;

1.Make gw only apply to item healing and then rebalance healing skills to numbers that aren't reduced

&amp;#x200B;

2.Reduce item healing and then either buff kit healing or nerf grievous wounds

&amp;#x200B;

3.Rebalance every single champ in the game that heals or buys healing items around 60% gw being applied 100% of the time

leagueoflegends,2021,1,"**TL;DR:**

1) Fix the bugs

2) Change toxic interactions with the jungle guardian.

3) Rework problematic events and rewards

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**1) Fixing the bugs**

I think Riot has actually done a good job with this one in between the last iteration of Nexus Blitz, and this iteration of Nexus Blitz. The mode does still have some bugs, but they happen far less often than before and there are far fewer of them. I remember bugs like Sion ulting out of the prize fight to his fountain or Syndra dragging the Jungle camps behind the cannon, or the enemy team surrendering causing them to win, which really ruin the overall game experience for both casual and competitive players. Whatever Riot did between the last iteration and this iteration helped a lot.

**2) Change toxic interactions with the jungle guardian**

The jungle guardian is basically like a fountain laser in your jungle. It's slow and clunky but the second it gets close enough to hit you it does half your health in one attack, and the other half very soon after. This means that any prolonged time spent in the enemy jungle (basically more than 5 seconds) will need to mean you immediately retreat or die to the guardian. Even if you do manage to kill it, which is no easy feat, another one spawns very soon after.

What this means is that counter jungling topside is limited to raptors, but the bigger glaring problem is that any event that causes you to go into the enemy jungle is an auto loss (Bardle Royale, DPS Check, and King of the Hill), and Loot Teemo/Veigar always seem to run there for prolonged time and then proceed to run behind the enemy's tower where they are low enough to be killed. 

The consensus seems to be that the jungle guardian is fine to exist to protect against counter jungling, however, the placement of events needs to be changed out of the influence of the jungle guardian.

**3) Rework problematic events and rewards (basically all of them need fixing of some sort)**

*Loot Teemo/Veigar:*

The pathing of these yordles needs to change. They should not be allowed to walk in the enemy jungle or behind enemy turrets considering how much gold they give. For this event it doesn't even matter if you lose it if your team got 5k gold from hitting it so much.

*DPS Check and King of the Hill:*

Don't spawn these in the influence of the jungle guardian. It's hard enough when it's close to the enemy's tower because they are down 2k gold, but spawning in the enemy jungle when the gold lead is less than 10k is literally just an auto loss and feels really bad as a player.

*Push the Cart, Scuttle Race, and Protect the Soraka:*

Aside from buggy interactions, I think these events are good examples of events that are pretty well balanced.

*Prize Fight:*

Reset everyone's cooldowns before the fight. The event is supposed to showcase intense close battles, but when your ultimate is on cooldown, it's really not a fair fight. They do this for URF so I don't see why this would be unhealthy for the game. You don't get any advantage from flash ulting right before the event starts.

*URF:*

My favorite event. I think it is pretty well balanced and actually fun.

*Bardle Royale:*

Just don't make the event end near the enemy jungle guardian. Everything else is really great about this event.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

*Rewards:*

I saw another reddit post that advocated for ""tiered rewards"" meaning that winning events by more should give you better rewards, and winning harder events should give you better rewards. For example winning 3-0 in prize fight versus 2-1 should give you a better tier reward. It is no secret some event rewards are far better than others (looking at you elder soul). Another example would be the losing team winning a mid game scuttle race. They should get a slightly better reward than if the winning team won. One way to implement slightly better rewards would be to slightly modify existing rewards. For example a slightly bigger shield from the huge shield reward, or more minions with hooks or less time between hooks for the Blessing of Blitzcrank. Elder Dragon could execute at higher or lower HP damages or add a slightly larger burn damage. The champion cannon could get more range or do bonus damage on impact or have a larger radius in which champions get knocked up. The cart could do more damage, or have a larger snow impact radius or a larger slow, or do more damage to tower. For gameplay clarity, the reward could say ""slightly improved"" or something along those lines.

Rewards should also be around the same tier in game. When one team gets Elder Soul while the other team gets Blessing of Blitzcrank, it leaves a bad taste in your mouth. This is easier to do. Things like the champion cannon and battle sled are on similar levels of strength, and the dragon souls are similar levels of strength.",2021-01-02 18:02:43

[I spent about 45 minutes making this pepe on Microsoft paint. At the start, it was mostly a troll since I was chilling with friends on a discord call, but after working on it for about 10 min, I realized I've had the same goddamn discord profile pic for 5 years so I decided to finish this and make it my profile pic. The problem is, I already started working on paint so I had to push through, and Microsoft paint has this weird feature where it leaves small white spots when you use the paint bucket, so I was forced to do some small touching up on photoshop. As you can probably tell, there's still some white spots on the edges of the staff and body, but its way better than it was before.

leagueoflegends,2021,1,"Void Staff is cheaper + the cheap component gives 15% upfront. Some popular Mythics give % pen per legendary. Meanwhile no fighter/ad/bruiser mythic gives +resists.

Visage got nerfed for most champs, FoN is legit trolling and weak. Since according to my knowledge DoT damage still counts as singular instance. If you face a Liandry+ Demonic Embrace Disney reindeer/ Malzahar/Zyra you simply have no counterplay if you get hit and in Malzahar's and Zyra's case you will get hit.

No wonder everyone just goes full omnivamp: there is no other way to deal with this shit. Other than fully heal on creeps or teamfights. 

And each time I have to choose a defensive item as a toplaner it is second or third item Steraks into Gargoyle. Even on champs like Sion or Sett that apparently would be buffed by the shielding increase from Visage its better to go pure health or Gargoyles. Abyssal Mask? No one but tanks theoretically want this item, but then why would you go the Mask over Gargoyles? Why even go an item that is now a conditional damage increase on immobilization nerfing mage usage of said item, they also took catalyst and cdr  away making it a generally much worse item overall for nothing to gain.Gargoyle is literally the only good MR item in the game left. Wits End is trash, way more expensive, shittier buildpath without recurve bow and unecessary ad strapped onto it+ loss of healing. The whole point of Wits End was a huge and cheap midgame spike for on hit champs or anti-mages. It fell off due to no on hit dmg scaling. Why are mages(and ap assasins which are arguably a bigger problem) allowed to keep their fuck you super defensive item for the same price and a still strong Armguard but fighters and on hit adcs are left with a crippled Wits End with a more expensive buildpath?

Visage nerfed, FoN is banking on nostalgia but fails completely at its task compared to Adaptive Helm. Maw is neutral but still weaker than Steraks by a long shot that is a generally awesome item.

Armor items got shafted but Mr items are absolute trash. I can't grasp my head around it what Riot attempted with this. Did they really intend for us to just stack HP again for the initial burst and getting omnivamp for the teamfights?",2021-01-02 22:06:46

For a better example:

The Heavy from TF2,

He just shoots projectiles in a rapid succession, giving overwhelming pressure onto enemy teams at the expense of being big, not amazing in long range and being slow.

Another example league would be Urgots machine gun and Lucians ultimate.

The idea (Potentially) is that their machine gun attacks function a bit like lucians Ultimate with some homing ability regarding what target to focus.

Potential cons of this can be like: not so great range, not so great mobility and stuff like that’s.

It seemed that before I would usually be 2 levels ahead of my junglers as a solo laner if everything was going ok for both of us (not fed but not behind) but now it seems that the gap has closed.

I don't think it adds anything to the game to have people being filled into matches to hard throw the game by selecting champs that don't fit the role.

I would rather wait 15 minutes for a game, then have to dodge and wait 5 minutes to maybe not have someone autofiller throw the game.

leagueoflegends,2021,1,"In Riot's ""Preseason Goals"" article from 5 months ago, they stated ""Healing has become more prevalent in the game over the last few years, and we’d like to address a few specific problems."" Over time, the amount of healing has increased. With runes reforged, things like lifesteal, spellvamp, and other sources of healing became accessible to every champion, especially since many of them could be stacked together. In their article, Riot clearly saw a problem with this, and this was their first goal: 

&gt;Healing has become so common that Grievous Wounds has gone from a contextual choice meant for healing-heavy games to a viable option in  most games. We're looking across runes, items, and champ kits to trim some healing where we think it's unnecessary, which should in turn reduce the necessity of Grievous Wounds options in builds.

Not only has riot not delivered on this goal, but it's gotten a lot worse since preseason began. Not only are the healing runes still strong, but now many classes have access to healing on their first item that they wouldn't have had before. Goredrinker, Eclipse, and Immortal Shieldbow are good examples of this. In addition, the ""nerf"" ravenous hunter got ended up being a buff. Changing it from ability vamp to omnivamp ended up in more overall healing for many auto attack based champions, so lowering its healing didn't matter much. Riot's response has been to buff grievous wounds which they did also included as a goal in their article. While they carried through with this goal, since they didn't carry through on the first one, it's introduced more problems.

Grievous wounds is more needed now in games than it ever has been. With the buffs its gotten and the increase of healing everywhere, GW is needed in too many games. Any game in which the enemy team has two or more of: Goredrinker bruisers, Shieldbow fighters, Eclipse assassins/fighters, lategame AD champions, Riftmaker bruisers, or champions that have healing-based kits may force you to build GW. Having to build GW too often is obnoxious since it gets in the way of your champion's natural build, making it not feel good or fun. In addition, the GW buffs negatively affect champions with in-built healing.

Champions like Soraka and Zac are suffering from the influx of GW since its been buffed, but their healing hasn't. GW no longer feels like an optional counter for champions like Soraka but a necessary item to build almost every game because its too int not to. If widespread healing was lowered, GW wouldn't be required every game, we'd be able to build more of what we want, and champions like Soraka or Zac could play with their kits more.

TL;DR

There are too many sources of omnivamp and general healing in the game. GW feels necessary in too many games. Champions with in-built healing who can't build omnivamp suffer.",2021-01-03 02:29:04

leagueoflegends,2021,1,"**From an enchanter's perspective**

If you for some reason still want to play a squishy AP scaling hyper carry in charge of babysitting the AD hyper carry in preseason 11 with it's increase in burst damage, decrease in TTK and more grevious wounds and shield break options there are 2 primary mythics of choice:

Imperial Mandate and Moonstone Renewer.

This at first appears to be a step up from the last seasons one stop shop of Athenes as it's double the choice however Moonstone feels noticeably worse to use (even with the added visual effects).

And this is down to the fundamentals of fantasy. Just like a Yasuo player wants to perfectly windwall an ability dodge a bunch of skillshots by dashing through a wave and getting a 4 man knockup and ult off in a really sick play an enchanter wants to make sick plays just not necessarily involving high damage numbers. 

Mandate does this just well enough- it's nothing special but it's still satisfying to CC an enemy and have your team melt the person you marked out. 

With old Athenes you gained stacks by actively damaging an enemy and chose which ally would get the heal and big shield which meant in a team fight you could provide the same sustain as moonstone but because you had to correctly prioritise who got healing and in which order it was more satisfying when your team lived. 

(Again I'm aware that Athene's was problematic in that it would stack too quickly for small amounts of participation, and it would allow burst healing at seemingly random as you could keep the stacks indefinitely and use it on a low health ally in a fight you haven't got any stack in because you had them stored from earlier).

Moonstone by design cannot live up to the same satisfaction of decision making as it's contemporaries.

Moonstone is designed to provide ridiculously good sustain based on length in team fight to the lowest health ally. It is passive and is much less flexible due to it's ramp up mechanic. And this wouldn't be such a problem if we didn't have Athene's example looming over it. Because even though Athene's was problematic it better fulfilled the support fantasy than moonstone. Athene's really amped up the support fantasy of dealing damage and sustaining a team getting stacks to heal more gave supports a new decision when it came to healing because at times it was better to hold a heal/shield to get more damage on the enemy to heal your ally for more.

By providing more sustain but being entirely passive support players are less engaged with how much sustain they are providing. It just doesn't feel earned. 

What's worse is Moonstone is definitely way too strong. On champions that can abuse it's insane. And yet it still pales in comparison to what it should have been aiming for as a battle support sustain option. 

It's a shame too because if Moonstone had been made as a tank sustain option and only ramped up based on dealing damage to enemies it may have found its own niche rather than being in Athene's shadow.",2021-01-03 03:22:33

leagueoflegends,2021,1,"Hello,

I’m looking to conduct an experiment to see if it’s possible to improve remote non-verbal communication between team members. League of Legends seems like it would be a great game to test this theory with (teams of five are important).  

I’ll be replicating Rupert Sheldrake’s Telephone Telepathy experiment ([https://youtu.be/\_tQe7NXIcnw](https://youtu.be/_tQe7NXIcnw)), where one guesser will try and determine who out of a pool of four callers is calling. In the initial experiment, when the guesser chose their pool of callers (usually close friends and family), they averaged \~42% correct, significantly higher than the 25% you’d expect from pure odds. However, when they conducted the experiment using strangers for the callers, the scores hovered around 25%.

There is a familiarity factor at play here, and I think it might have to do with being in close physical proximity to one another. To test this, I would like to perform the experiment with people that coordinate/cooperate on a regular basis but have never met in person. Also all participants must be over the age of 18 and residing within the United States.

If you and your teammates meet these criteria and would like to participate, please message me and we can set up a time to conduct the experiment. I expect it will take less than an hour and can be done entirely through Discord. I can pay each participant $25 via PayPal or Venmo.

Thanks,

its fucking absurd how much shielding and lifesteal this item provides. on ad carries, you know am cool with it. they have no shields and its their only lifeline. on yasuo and yone? fuck no. especially yasuo. he has a shield that can proc multiple times in a fight and windwall. hes just unkillable at the moment.

you guys remember when he was doing great without his buffs last season and without buying any sort of ad until his second item? now lets slap all of these buffs. a giant shield, and more lifesteal than BT and see what happens

shit is gamebreaking on them right now imo. you actually can't kill them with most champions

Maokai though? He does the same thing, but WAY safer. Not only safer, but he gets to start doing it far sooner and with arguably just as good (If not literally better) damage early on as Teemo shrooms, just because of his Sapling coming with built in Max HP burn.  


Like, its actually nuts how good his saplings are. Especially when you consider the fact that there's virtually no counter play to them compared to Teemo's shrooms. THere is no sweeping them. If you get close, they trigger and somehow always manage to catch you unless you have a teleport/dash to quickly move yourself away.

Malphite W - big tanky rock boy

\- Assassin        (burst damage)

\- Fighter          (damage/survival)

AP:      - Battlemage  (damage/survival)

\- Burst             (burst damage)

\- Enchanter     (support)

Tank:   - Vanguard     (solo focus)

\- Warden         (support focus)

There will be no changes to the 3 AD-Sections. Mage, Tank and Support will be changed into 3 AP-Sections and 2 Tank-Sections. 1 AP-Section and 1 Tank-Section will be focusing on Support. AD-Sections will have red Symbols, AP-Sections will be blue and Tank-Sections will be green. Each Section will have 3 Mythic Items (Fighters 4) and a few Legendary Items. Current Mythic Items will be rearranged.

[Mythic Item Restructure](https://preview.redd.it/w5pqf5ith3961.png?width=593&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=12bfc5d3b92a4433a1e94ec2d27220cd01bab39a)

Up until this point, it was just restructuring. The following Part is about Item Changes and additional Items. The Core of these Changes is the Removal of Mana from Mythic Items and adding 2 new Legendary Items building out of Tear of the Goddess. Another part is the adjusting of Item Stats and the addition of 2 new Mythic Items (Enchanter/Warden).

Mana has a gold value of 1.4 per 1 Mana, which is 840 gold for 600 Mana. Currently Mana Mythics cost 200 gold more then Manaless Mythics. To compensate the loss of Mana, the price will be lowered by 200 gold and they will get 250 Health in addition. Also Manaless Mythics will get an additional 5 Ability Haste in order to make them even with Mana Mythics. Champions who mostly build Mana Mythics will have their Mana adjusted.

The new Legendary Items building out of Tear of the Goddess will focus on Champions, who prefer Ability Haste or Health over AP. Both Legendary Items will grant 50 AP and no additional AP based on Mana. Instead one of them will grant Ability Haste and the other one will grant Health based on Mana. Since they build out of Tear of the Goddess they can't be bought together. Once the Items are fully charged they will transform and gain an additional Passive. The Ability Haste Item will gain a similiar Passive to Muramana, but this one will deal 2 % Mana magic damage and it will only work on Abilities. The Health Version will gain the old Eternity Passive.

The new Mythic Items will cost 2500 gold like the other Support Items. The new Enchanter Item will have the same Stats as the other 2 Enchanter Mythics and will have an Active to shoot an Ice Arrow in a straight line ahead. The Arrow will reveal and slow any enemy hit, but it does no damage and is a single target skillshot. The Active has 2 charges. The new Warden Item will have the same Stats as Locket of the Iron Solari. Instead of a Support Active or Passive, this Item will be focusing on your own survival. It will have a Lifeline Passive and will gain Tank Stats from the Mythic Passive.",2021-01-03 12:02:25

leagueoflegends,2021,1,"We all know its coming its just a matter of time when. This probably wont get any attention or consideration but I think its fun to design champions.

This idea chooses to keep udyrs identity with his different forms but bring him more up to date and in line with newer champions so that he is easier to balance and a better experience to play as, and against.

Passive - Monkies Agility: After using an ability, udyr gains a burst of attack speed. This does not stack, but does refresh.

Q - Tiger's Stance: Udyr lunges foward a short distance with his tiger claws, dealing damage in a straight line and shredding a % of the targets armor. Until Udyr activates a different ability he gains Attack damage.

W - Turtle's Stance: Udyr sucks in the natural energy around him, this deals a small amount of magic damage in a circle around him and interrupts abilities being cast. Until Udyr activates a different ability he gains a shield equal to a % of his max HP.

E - Bear's Stance: Udyr lunges forward a short distance and smashes the ground with his fists dealing aoe physical damage in an area around where he lands, enemies struck are stunned for a short duration. Until Udyr activates a different ability he gains a moderate amount of movement speed. 

R - Phoenix's Stance: Udyr discharges natural energy from his body causing flame to erupt in front of him in a line. Enemies hit take magical damage and have their attack speed reduced. Until Udyr activates a different ability he gains bonus attack speed.

leagueoflegends,2021,1,"I have not played League of Legends in a about 2 years, but i want to get back into it next season cause I miss the feeling of climbing the ladder. The fact that I cant reset my Mastery bothers me and I have wondered about this for years now since the Mastery System came out.

I was a Yasuo Solo Main (yes, i know) back since he came out, with Zed and Talon as second Mains. The reason why I slowly became uninterested in the game was the reputation that certain champions where associated with over time. No matter how I played, the fact that I had over 1 Million points on Yasuo was sort of a ""last argument"" against me. Things like :""1 million points on yasuo omfg."" ""typical yasuo hahaha"" ""better mid laner wins"" where slowly growing on me and made me lose interest in the game. I played less and less until i eventually quit the game. To make it worse, the 10 Ban system made it so that it was nearly impossible to solo main him anyways (since he always was a goo bann choice). I contacted the support if it was possible for them to delete Yasuo of of my account and erase all my mastery points with him. But they said deleting Yasuo and all of my purchased skins (which i was fine with) was not going to get rid of his mastery.

And I know what some people might think of this situation. ""Whats the issue, just play whatever champ you like"" ""You don't have to play him anymore' ""Just make a new account"" First of all I put way to much sweat and tears (and money tbh) into this account to just throw it all away. I am the type of player who wants to play ONE champion and climb the ladder with him. Getting better with one of hundreds of champions and slowly developing this ""bond"" with a character is what essentially make me even play LoL so much. I just AM that type of player, and I KNOW I'm not the only one. And the fact that with the mastery system we have a way of looking into the kind of effort a player put into a champion is a good thing, and i still think the addition of a mastery system this way is not inherently ""toxic"", but it can become so. For some players its something very casual to get over, but to a player like me, it will ALWAYS bother me that I know this toxic champion that i don't play anymore due to various reasons will be shown as my number 1 played champion on my profile. Btw the reason why i essentially stopped playing him (and even Zed) is due to his ban rate, I hated that every other game I had to play talon simple because yasuo and zed were banned. His toxic reputation was just the icing on the cake i guess. 

The fact that there isn't even the OPTION to remove mastery for players like me bothers me, that's basically all I'm essentially saying. So even if you disregard EVERY personal aspect of my post my argument still stands that we need an option to reset the mastery. I remember there was a similar issue regarding the mastery points back when Aatrox was remade: [Here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/AatroxMains/comments/9lb21c/riot_wont_reset_mastery_points/) 

TLDR: Slowly stopped playing League cause there is no option of resetting mastery points.",2021-01-03 14:09:34
leagueoflegends,2021,1,"First of all I would like to clarify that I do not speak English as my first language, so some sentences may be spelled incorrectly, I apologize.
Lol and the world of mobas is new to me and that's why I'm not very good.  I started playing only against BOTs and rarely did a normal game.  Yesterday I reached level 20 and since I usually do very well with BOTs I decided to do some drafts, even though I ended up losing most of them. Some of them gone very well, some started well and ended badly, and some gone badly all along.  In these cases (when I always play badly) I am told that I am ruining the game and I end up being reported.  Obviously I can't do anything but apologize, in the end it is my fault, but I would like to understand what to do in these situations.  If I throw myself into team fights I die, if I attack from the distance and try not to die I end up being useless and if I try to farm I get attacked by stronger people and die (even with minions and even if I try to escape).  I would like to improve and try to understand how to avoid ruining the games I play, also because now I'm bored of playing against BOTs.  I usually play mid or jungle with characters I know how to use, if I have to try new ones I play against BOTs. To give an example in the last game I played in jungle with Nunu, the result in the end was 2/9/10 for me and my total damage was just 5000. Also the 10 assists cannot really be counted given the  little damage I did, plus the two kills were done early in the game (it was going well for me).  For the others it was going really well, the mid was 18/4/8, top 8/7/9 and adc 6/7/8.  So I'm sorry I ruined the game, especially for the mid laner, and I understand the report.  What should I do in these situations?  That is when their jungler already has 2 kills on you in the mid-game and you are too weak to gank, or when in mid lane you can't even attack the enemy scared to give them kills. Also I would like to know if there is a game mode with less strong people, perhaps of my skill level, not to win, but to avoid being the only one who sucks :/",2021-01-03 14:09:54

leagueoflegends,2021,1,"Recently there has been a lot of threads about toxicity, and the general toxicity in the game is increasing over time. 

I feel people flaming or being toxic in chat is not really an issue people should be worried about. 

It's human nature to be angry or sad when disappointed especially in a competitive environment. This becomes worse if the fault comes from your teammates. 

Example: Your tried your best in a group project, but your group mates barely put any effort, so you were awarded average marks.

Knowing all your efforts were in vain will surely cause disappoinment, but most people can't take their anger out on others IRL. But league is a very competitive online video game where everyone plays anonymously. 

My point is that people getting angry is not an issue, and not something that can be fixed unless we somehow change human DNA to not feel anger.  

Riot provided us with the option to disable chat permanently or mute everyone when things are looking bad, and we should fully utilize those features. 

Riot should work towards other problems such as Client and dealing with AFK/ Intentionally Feeding players.",2021-01-03 14:25:18

Also... I suck... and am wondering if blitz sucks at high elos because people are so good it is almost impossible to hit a grab... making his role almost nothing...

Grabbing people during the lane phase is a super fun game, but i hate it when a champ contributes almost nothing late game, and i would hate never being able to hit a grab because the ELO is too high

leagueoflegends,2021,1,"Hey guys, i wanted to point out that tanks are suffering so much from RIOT and maybe even ask why it is like that. Since 7 years my most favourite role is tank and second is support which is mostly tanks like Thresh, Leona, Naut and stuff. I stopped so many times playing this game but startet again and im pretty sure many people did that. Sad thing is this game seriously is going down even more then i expected. Now it feels like a mobile game that is made with ridiculous concepts. The gameplay feels like URF mode with no tactics, just a Clusterfck and anyone dies in under 1 seconds and YES even tanks. 

I love unique items especialy for tanks. RIOT really is creative with items not gonna lie even for tanks. Like Randuin Omen, Chemtank or Sunfire. But why are they made so weak even tho they have such a nice passiv/active?

For example Randuin Omen the perfect example how it is a good idea but a terrible scaling. Slows, reduce AD and crit damage if activated and passiv reduces damage taken based on HP. Nice right? But seriously.. reduces AD for 10%? Crit damage for 20%? And you give this item a 60 seconds cool down which is another point since almost every tank item with an active or trigger passiv has a cooldown higher then almost all ultimates in the game. This season is the season of items right? I mean we all can agree with that one but tanks? Since they cant tank anymore what should they do now if there are no items for them? 

Lets come back to the cooldowns. 90 seconds for Turbo Chem, 90 seconds for Solari, 90 seconds for Stoneplate, 60 seconds for Steraks, 90 seconds for Shurelyas AND IT LITERALY JUST GIVES MOVEMENT SPEED! Its a god damn weak Sivir ult which has double the CD of hers. What is with all that hate against tanks in this this company in the past years? You created an item (Kraken Slayer) that LEGIT gives Vayne W passiv i mean seriously its legit Vaynes W because all the other items and botrk is not enough right? What about other items made for other classes with cd?

Strikebreaker 20 sec, Goredrinker 15 sec, Eclipse 8 sec melee 16 sec range, Duskblade 15 sec, Botrk 20 sec, Edge of Night 40 sec, Everfrost 20 sec, Ludens 10 sec, Night Harvester 40 sec, Protobelt 40 sec.

Some of these items are LITERALY abilities. Everfrost has 100 base damage, 30% AP scaling and it slows 65% for 1,5 seconds OR freeze in the center. 65%! 1,5 seconds! Freeze! And its just 20 seconds CD. Lissandra can literaly have 5 abilities with this since its as strong as an ability. What about Goredrinker active? 110% AD scaling on his damage. You get 20% of your AD and 12% of your missing HP back oh and guess what? You get a passiv which gives you 1% AD per 5% missing HP with a cap of 15% which means you heal even MORE! And the cooldown? Yes. 15 seconds which can be reduced with cdr. It can even be reduced.

Many many more comparison are there but I already wrote too much. Im just a tank player in League who (and any other games that has classes) wants to TANK. I really dont want to feel like a Yuumi against one champ anymore. I just got 3000 damage from Senna with no armor penetration in under 3 seconds while having 200 Armor. 200 Armor thats 2 items..

leagueoflegends,2021,1,"I can't think of much and I'd like help with the mental.  Going back and looking over the item goals is actually depressing.  I found ONE point that they successfully addressed.  

This is legit the only point I've read that they even got close to succeeding with.   
 

* **Ability Haste as a choice** for Mages- With the rework from Cooldown Reduction to Ability Haste, we can use the stat to create another decision point in mage builds. This allows for some super Haste-focused builds and other powerful builds that give up Haste for other gains.

It does feel like mages have to make the choice which is nice.  I'm also someone who enjoys the mana changes but those weren't talked about anywhere in the goals post so I'm assuming it's something that was just overlooked and happened to become a nice positive for me.

But that's the only point of success lmao. And over half of this community sees the new idea behind mana to be a step backward.  So they accomplished one, maybe two, things.  And the rest of what they said is legitimately just nonsense because they didn't even attempt any of their own points.

The entire tank section is such a joke I'm just going to copy and paste the entire thing.   


* **More options to adapt to team strategy** \- Tanks need to fill a wide variety of functions for their team, so we want to make sure they have build options to support them while getting the necessary defenses to be a meatshield. Do you need to match a split pushing Tryndamere? Hard engage on an Azir? Protect a Kog’Maw carry? All of these directions should be clearly supported by new options.
* **Filled out magic resist options** \- The current MR options are a bit niche and feel like they don't offer strong options to deal with teams that require effectiveness against multiple AP playstyles at once.
* **Enhance tank utility** \- Tanks create value for their team by being immovable damage soaks while also providing CC and other utility. We want to create more items to showcase the utility attributes of tanks beyond their baseline defenses.
* **Late-game capstone items** \- We’ve seen a satisfying type of item across a few other classes that's only efficient when bought late game, but creates a satisfying capstone that feels like it completes your build (like Deathcap). We hope to create one or two of these items for tanks to be excited about in their very late game slots.

None of these points were accomplished and most of them set back even further than they began.  This is all of their points I'm not just pasting the ones that look particularly bad.  They failed them all.

&amp;#x200B;

So help me out guys. Right now I would like for the item update to be reverted. To me it has accomplished basically nothing and added so many more issues to the game. Let me know about anything you think the item update has accomplished. Something that has moved the game forward.  Because right now it just feels like wasted effort that could've been used elsewhere to me.",2021-01-03 15:57:09

leagueoflegends,2021,1,"Hello guys!  


TL;DR  


What kind of support do you think we'll get this year?  Rell was the last year's champion who's a tank. So 2021 support cannot be a tank. That leaves out an Enchanter support, or a first Mage support, or another experimental and nontraditional support like Pyke and Senna. Every mage support in the game was designed as a midlaner and we also do not have a true male ranged Enchanter support.  


  


I've been wondering what kind of support we may get this year. Recently, we've gotten:  


&gt;  
\- **Tank, Rell** (late 2020)  
\- **Marksman-Support experiment, Senna** (late 2019)  
\- **Enchanter, Yuumi** (mid 2019)  
\- **Assassin, Pyke** (mid 2018)  


The past 3 years were the most diverse in the history of league's support class. As you can see we got a marksman and an assassin. This is pretty wild considering support class used to consist of only tanks and enchanters at the early stages of the game.   


Interestingly, we have never gotten a **MAGE** that was designed as a support. Every mage support we currently have either was either designed as a midlaner (***Zyra &amp; Brand***), or as a mage-support hybrid (***Lux &amp; Orianna***)   


The closest thing could be Zilean, however according to his [wiki](https://leagueoflegends.fandom.com/wiki/Zilean) he is a specialist and does not fit into any class. I also cannot find the offcial Zilean's champion spotlight anywhere to confirm his designed role and class. So.. let's leave him out.   


Following Riot's recent trend with non-traditional supports (like Senna &amp; Pyke), do you think we will get an actual MAGE SUPPORT this year?   


What I mean by actual is a mage that was desinged as a botlane support and not a midlaner who got later degraded to a support + also has no ally shielding/healing.   


Given the fact that we just got Seraphine who's a Midlane **Enchanter\*** and not so long ago we got Senna who has enchanter-like features and an actual Enchanter Support Yuumi.   


Do you think it's possible that we'll get an Enchanter support this year?  


I think Enchanter role really needs their first **MALE** pure **Enchanter** botlane support.   


*I do not count Taric and Rakan as one since they're basically both melee and a mix of 2 classes. Ivern also doesn't count because he is only a jungler.. which is a shame.*  


Every Enchanter, or should I say **Enchantress**, is a ranged female character. (Soraka, Janna, Nami and the list goes on)

Yeah you can mute everyone and it isnt always about people writing toxic things.

leagueoflegends,2021,1,"Hello everyone, before anything else I would like to say that I'm not really used to using reddit and I'm also quite new to this subreddit. I didn't find any rules, so I'm not really sure if this post fits the guidelines. If It's not in order do let me know and I'll change it.

Now for the post

I would like to share my thoughts on getting duskblade instead of goredrinker on Aatrox. In the right circumstances, I really enjoy building this item.

First, in a situation where you are up against 4 or 5 ranged champions, it can get a little hard to make good use of the goredrinker's active, in a situation like this and depending on  both team comps i'll opt to get duskblade instead. The slow that duskblade gives can make it easier for you to stick on your target when they use an escape tool and helps you to land Q1.

Second, when you are in the middle of a teamfight and you manage to secure a takedown, the stealth that duskblade gives synergises quite well with the cooldown of your Q and E and with the movement speed burst that you get for having your ult reset. Indirectly, this also makes you tankier as enemies won't be able to hit you when you are invisible. After the invisibility ends, you are able to hit them with a new rotation of your Q. Instead of facetanking like you would be able to with goredrinker, you avoid taking damage.

I'll go over the pro's and cons now of getting duskblade instead of goredrinker.

**Pro's:**

\- It's very fun

\- You deal massive amounts of damage thanks to the lethality in your build. This usually is activated even harder as you would get this mostly against squishies.

\- Duskblade's slow makes it easier to stick on targets.

\- Stealth aligns really well with the cooldown of your Q and E and with the movement speed burst from getting a kill in your ultimate.

\- You avoid hitting damage in stealth

\- Mental edge. Going invisible in your ultimate can really disrupt the flow of battle for the enemy. Constantly not knowing where you will pop up makes it easier for them to mess up.

&amp;#x200B;

**Cons:**

\- Statwise it's squishier than goredrinker, plus goredrinker active can really give you that burst of health that can make or break a teamfight.

\- you don't heal as much as you would have if you got goredrinker.

\- It's situational

\- The red effect that appears on your screen collides when getting a reset in your ultimate collides with the blue effect from invisibility, which makes it confusing to know sometimes if you actually went in stealth.

\- When you get locked down by cc, you will go down far more quickly than if you had goredrinker.

&amp;#x200B;

In the end I would suggest to try it out as it really is a fun item to play with. It gives Aatrox some assassin elements instead of purely the bruiser/draintanker that he would be otherwise. I have actually won ranked games with this, but the main catch is that it's a situational item.

I would enjoy to hear your opinions on this :)",2021-01-03 16:32:30

leagueoflegends,2021,1,"I am by no means a Camille player, but this is an inconsistency I’ve noticed quite a bit.


How come Camille E was nerfed to not be able to stun camps (scuttler specifically) but graves passive lets him do it on a basic attack? Camille E is a high cooldown ability that enables her to gank and fight. Isn’t it enough that when she has to use it on a camp, she can’t gank/fight effectively for a bit?

He’s (graves) already virtually invincible in the jungle while still having a really fast clear, he can easily duel most champs, he has great gank potential, he can build whatever he wants as long as it gives ad, and he scales well into late.

Camille got this nerf when she was really strong so it was understandable, but graves and a few other characters have been at the top for a few months now and nothings been done other than some E armor stacking nerf.

I’m really not sure what the weakness of this role is supposed to be. Clearing camps has been a joke for years so they level very quickly and safely in the early game. Jungle XP never really falls off too hard until the game is basically over so they can stay even or even ahead of laners through decent farming. Red smite makes it too difficult for laners to 1v1 a competent jungler and is just a completely unnecessary “win more” boost as most junglers already are great duelists.  Objectives like Dragons, Herald, and Baron just blow the game wide open at any point of the game. And right now AFK farming the jungle lets you snowball out of control and you get dumbass shit like Yi, Kha’Zix, Hecarim and Graves just blowing up squishies with 2 abilities from midgame onward.  It seems like only way for junglers to truly be punished is by other junglers through counterjungling so the game just revolves around these two players to see which one gets to 1v9 the game.

Despite this, the surrender mechanic still waits to the 20-minute mark to allow a team to give up.

I've been in a ton of games where one team is horribly down, but they aren't allowed to surrender at the 15-minute mark because ""someone is holding us hostage,"" and the whole becomes a massive flame war until either **1)** they can get enough people to surrender at 20 or **2)** the other team wins.

If Riot is aiming for fast games, we should be allowed to surrender earlier too.  I think we should either be allowed to surrender at 15 with a 4/5 vote, or a staggered surrender system, where the longer it goes, the easier it is to surrender (ie, if a game is over 30 minutes, a 3/5 vote allows you to surrender).

Something has to be done, that why this suggestion to give support more gold with as compensation they receive damage reduction during their quest progress. An example:

# Spellthief's Edge 

15 Ability Power

10 Health

50% Base Mana Regen

&lt;!gold per 10 seconds removed&gt;

**Tribute:** While nearby an ally champion, damaging Abilities and Attacks against champions, Cannon Minions or buildings grant 40 gold. This can occur up to 3 times every 30 seconds.

**Quest progress:** During the quest progress you deal **10% reduced damage.**

**Quest:** Earn 600 gold from this item to transform it into Frostfang, gaining **Active -** **Warding**. 

**Final Quest:** Earn 600 Gold using this item to upgrade to Shard of True Ice, increasing the WARD active to instead have 4 wards in stock gain ""**5 Gold Per 10 Seconds**"" &amp; you no longer deal 10% reduced damage. 

&amp;#x200B;

A similar change could be done for the other 3. 

# Other changes

**Item costs**

Shurelya's Battlesong, Locket of the Iron Solari, Imperial Mandate &amp; Moonstone Renewer increased to 3000 gold. This would indirectly keep Ivern in check as well.

**Champions**

Champions like Zyra Q &amp; E damage buffed. This would indirectly buff her jungle clear &amp; solo lane position. Other champions like Karma could receive a similar treatment if needed.

&amp;#x200B;

Mythics need to be generalized more, support should be able to impact the game &amp; streamlining mythic would be the first step in that direction. Dealing reduced damage could hinder solo laners from abusing it once again.",2021-01-03 18:33:40

leagueoflegends,2021,1,"Hello I am new to this game, I started playing 3 days ago with my friend, but he became pretty toxic even though we were the same level. It’s hard playing with him because he expects everything to go his way which results in his death every game and him yelling at me over small stuff like sitting in a bush to sneak up on the enemy to kill it. Yesterday he got so tilted because I was a supporter and didn’t heal him while him and another person decided to go into the jungle alone to fight the enemy team no pings no nothing so apparently it was my fault he died when me and three other players weren’t notified to go in the jungle to help fight. My friend was the jungler, and he never once pinged in the jungle for anything or came to help the lanes, but as soon as he wanted someone to push a lane which was a full on suicide mission he costed us the game multiple times! After the game yesterday I decided I don’t want to play with someone like that so I came on Reddit to get some advice for these three characters I enjoy playing so I won’t be a disappointment to other teams like I am when it comes to playing with him. (We both started playing at the same time, but he acts like he’s so much better than everyone. It’s probably his ego.)

Tristana, Kai’Sa, and Sona.

I love these characters, but I don’t understand Kai’Sa’s “R” I need a strong build for Tristana so I can kill faster. She’s pretty strong and I am glad I started to use her, and I have no problems with Sona I do well with her until my ADC decides to run into the enemies and die which I’m not about to chase you in especially when I barely do damage, but if you have and tips about those three characters just leave them below. :)",2021-01-03 18:56:22

I know this probably isn't news to the greater player base but I am so tired of arguments in normals over ""who called it first"" because both players clients' show them that they personally called first and they are incapable of accepting it may not be accurate.

So yeah if you didn't know that was a thing, that's a thing. Hope that saves you from a little grief in the lobby and I know when I found out about it I was kinda happy that maybe not everyone was just being petty and lying.

We checked the game out and they were all silvers... and on top of that, he is unranked. So my GF decided to ask him about it (without breaking any rules or being rude)

 ""Why are u playing aganist silver players when u are claiming to be diamond 1? ""

Instantly banned

This made us chuckle a bit. Now it was obvious that he´s tricking his viewers. so I proceeded to react.

"" imagine banning people for asking a legitimate question about matchmaking  ""

Instanly banned.

Alistar has a lot of potential as League's very own minotaur, but hasn't aged well in terms of design. I wanted to explore a version of him that's long sinced escaped the Noxian gladiatorial pits and established himself as the king and liberator of his people. I also wanted to place him and the rest of his minotaur kin within their own space in Runeterra, and thought it'd be cool if they were to settle in an environment not unlike Summoner's Rift, which is an area that thus far has not really been explored lore-wise.

leagueoflegends,2021,1,"tl;dr Tanks with a lot of CC MUST NOT deal such insane damage. It's either CC or huge damage - both are toxic for the game.

Tank supports with insane CC that deal more damage than the ADC and you literally stand no chance to win a 1v1 against.

Having a TON of CC is needed in the game, I agree. But why does a Leona have to burst me for 80% of my health without ANY damage items as a tank support champion?   
Alistar is a perfect example. He has a lot of CC, he's a tank but he does not burst you for that huge amount of damage like Leona does.

\-Full tank Ornn comes from top, you cannot even take 5% of his hp yet he literally ONESHOTS you even though he only has tank items and he's not supposed to burst you like that.   
\-Full tank Malphite that you have no chance of killing even if you're playing the anti-tank ad carries because if he hits ult on you, you're dead. Oneshot. Yeah, he literally onehits you with his combo because he's a full tank Malphite, why not?  
\-Zac is ultra annoying because of his jumps and CC BUT he cannot oneshot you, you have a chance of doing something against him.   


To be honest, as an ADC main it feels like tanks are more dangerous for me than assassins. I can outplay a Kha'Zix that walks to me by not isolating myself etc and you actually deal damage to them. Of course assassins oneshot you BUT that is their job, they're squishy and dangerous. TANKS ARE NOT ASSASSINS! They are worse.",2021-01-03 20:12:51

leagueoflegends,2021,1,"# LoL Rewind (Year In Review Generator)

https://rewind.lol/

This website will generate a full match-history-in-review compiling data from every match played within the last 1-2 years.

Supported Regions: NA, EUW, EUNE, RU, BR, JP, KR, LAN, LAS, OCE, TR

See https://imgur.com/a/naYFYcv or https://rewind.lol/user.html?username=Shmikal&amp;region=NA for an example of what to expect.

## Features
- Free to use
- Fun facts like W/L streaks, likelihood of tilting
- Cool network graphs for your friend relations and item builds
- Stats per champion played by you, your team, and your enemies
- Friend stats
- Stats by match length
- Heatmaps of places you got kills/deaths
- Calendar heatmaps of when you play league
- Hourly winrate heatmaps
- Tables of items built by you, your team, and the enemy
- Lots of stat-appropriate colors

## Ideal Summoners
Feel free to try this website even if you don't meet the ideal criteria; but just know that certain sections of the website may be empty or non-functional. Have you played at least 50 games that meet all of the following criteria?

- PvP (not vs AI)
- matchmade (not custom games)
- 5v5
- summoner's rift
- non-RGM
- in the last 1-2 calendar years

## How to use it
1. Enter your name in the username text field.
1. Select a region.
1. Press the ""update/add summoner"" button if you'd like to see data from every match from the last 2 years. Otherwise, press ""add summoner 2020"" for matches played during 2020 only.
1. Wait in the update queue.\*
1. Return to the homepage and use the ""lookup"" or ""lookup 2020"" button once you've been processed.
1. Share it with your friends!

\***2020-only update requests will always be processed before generic requests.** For the fastest processing, I recommend you use the ""2020-only"" option. Otherwise you will be waiting for all the 2020 requests to be fulfilled before your request is processed. This queue policy allows us to process the highest volume of profiles for now.

## Limitations
- It is slow to process each player one by one (there is a lot of data to retrieve)
- It might have bugs
- It might look bad
- It will have data from the past 2 calendar years, so that would include data from seasons 9, 10, and 11.
- I am the only one working on it and I am providing it on a best-effort basis

Happy new year. I sincerely hope you enjoy it and discover something interesting :P I'll also be monitoring the comments for questions, etc.

Edit: The queues are getting a bit long but rest assured we are fully operational. It's still better to join the queue now rather than later.

Edit: For those attempting to reach the website from unsupported regions, I've relaxed the firewall rules so you can try to access the website again.

Edit: So far we've processed about ~~2300~~ 3000 profiles since this post has been up. Thank you to everyone for your patience. At this point, I will not be monitoring this thread regularly. Feel free to join our discord or to message me privately.",2021-01-03 20:31:15

leagueoflegends,2021,1,"Hey all,

It's that time of year again and hopefully this split I'm going to play you away, thanks as always for the support to the LPL team; hoping this year is even better:

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\#17 - LGD

&amp;#x200B;

Top - Garvey / Cult

Jungle - Flora / Kui

Mid - Uniboy

ADC - Kramer

Support - Peace

&amp;#x200B;

\- They exploded their roster and lost their biggest selling points in Xiye and Peanut. The only remaining element is Kramer (and technically Garvey + Cult).

\- They have a largely inexperienced roster who have had little stage time apart from Kramer and Uniboy

\- Kramer had a rough 2020 and Uniboy is not a big enough change to effect my feelings on what became one of my favourite teams in 2020 :(

&amp;#x200B;

\#16 - Estar

&amp;#x200B;

Top - Zs

Jungle - H4cker

Mid - Insulator / Irma

Adc - Rat

Support - ShiauC

&amp;#x200B;

\- The same Estar team with the addition of H4cker, Zs &amp; Insulator, not big enough upgrades to give me the confidence that Estar will be a good team

\- Expecting the team to lack a powerful identity and be able to rely on the upcoming solo laners from the LDL - Insulator/Irma &amp; Zs are at the bottom of their roles

\- Same issue as LGD - Quite a bit of inexperience in the roster and it will take a lot of time to develop

&amp;#x200B;

\#15 - OMG

&amp;#x200B;

Top - New

Jungle - Aki

Mid - Wuming / Bright

Adc - Eric

Support - Bafang / Cold

&amp;#x200B;

\- Exciting changes that I think could make OMG a contender for top 8 if the solo lanes develop in the way I hope; New was great on RNG &amp; Wuming was a blood thirsty mid laner on RW.

\- One of the most inexperienced Rosters in the LPL with only Cold holding more than a years experience in the LPL

\- A great example of a development roster; just very limited expectations in Spring

&amp;#x200B;

\#14 - TT (Previously Dominus Esports)

&amp;#x200B;

Top - Chelizi

Jungle - Xiaopeng / Bless / VV

Mid - Captain / Sky

Adc - SamD

Support - Teeen

&amp;#x200B;

\- A massive upgrade from their Summer Roster (With Captain coming from the IG Young 2020 LDL Champion Squad + SamD from the hype V5 Roster)

\- Still concerns on how Chelizi will stack up to other top laners when his last debut on Vici in 2019 &amp; 2020 were super underwhelming. Also concerned with SamD and his new support meshing as 2020 Summer was SamD's first LPL split.

\- The development of this roster is one of the most hyped and I think by the end of Spring we will get an understanding if its valid or not. This team can hit playoffs in Summer if all goes as expected.

&amp;#x200B;

\#13 - LNG

Top - M1kuya

Jungle - Tarzan

Mid - Icon / Plex

Adc - Light

Support - Iwandy

&amp;#x200B;

\- Another roster with big upgrades; especially with what I think is one of the biggest role upgrades in the jungle (because I thought Xx was not good). Tarzan debuting in the LPL is super hyped and something I think could make or break this team.

\- Have put them here because of the above fact as it might definitely take time for LNG to gel. Especially with Icon since he's moving into a new environment after being the Star on OMG for many years

\- Light and Iwandy have shown good development + now have more experience in their mid and jungle. Concern is for M1kuya who is coming from the LDL but has high prospects. It's a cop out but another ""wait and see"" roster with much stronger grounding due to Icon and Tarzan.

&amp;#x200B;

\#12 - Rogue Warriors

Top - Ziv

Jungle - Haro

Mid - Forge

Adc - Betty / Kelin 

Support - QiuQiu

&amp;#x200B;

\- Haro is still the driving force of this team so it does feel like roster swaps have to be incredibly major to change my thoughts on this crazy blood hungry team. Haro just has new pawns to make him happy &gt;:D

\- Big names joining however with Ziv who old LMS fans will remember + Betty from RNG. There's a lot more of a solid ground on RW so fills me with confidence on top of the above fact.

\- Will still be one of the most entertaining teams in the LPL; they will beat teams above them and randomly lose to those below them

&amp;#x200B;

\#11 - RNG

Top - Xiaobai

Jungle - Wei / XLB

Mid - Xiaohu / Cryin

Adc - Gala

Support - Ming / LeLe

&amp;#x200B;

\- RNG are essentially the same and a lot of the fans would have heard that Xiaohu is now back to mid which is a breath of fresh air (yes I also think Cryin needs a starting position but what can you do

\- Gala showed a lot of promise towards the end of last year and has a great path ahead of him

\- RNG still struggle with a strong voice and common direction most of the time; they'll sit around where they sat in Summer and let old fans down

&amp;#x200B;

\#10 - EDG

Top - Flandre / Xiaoxiang

Jungle - Clearlove / JieJie

Mid - Scout / Gori

Adc - Viper / Hope

Support - Meiko

&amp;#x200B;

\- Clearlove coming out of retirement is obviously super exciting but I'm skeptical on if it puts them in the comfort of playoffs right out of the gate...

\- They've upgraded Top with Flandre, ADC with Viper and have a hungry import in Gori behind Scout (The irony of another Faker-shadow going to EDG, just like Scout 5 years ago). It's a good move but I feel like EDG should have already been successful with the players they had in 2020 so I'm keeping them just out of playoffs.

\- Having said that, EDG have leveled up even more in 3 roles. The biggest variable for me is Clearlove, if he performs like he did when he brought back EDG in 2019 then this is a Spring Playoff team.

&amp;#x200B;

\#9 - Suning

Top - Bin

Jungle - Sofm

Mid - Angel

Adc - Jinjiao / Huanfeng

Support - Owo

&amp;#x200B;

\- This is probably one of the hottest takes; Suning are still the Worlds 2020 Runner Up with 4/5 of the roster. However, losing SwordArt was so much more than just losing their support.

\- They lost their shotcaller, their voice and the direction of the team. There is so much value to a strong voice for a high tier LPL league of legends team that I think Suning will be overshadowed by some of the more powerful and optimised roster changes.

\- I also go back to what I remember in the LPL which was that Suning were kept down in the regular season by a lot of the more decisive top tier LPL teams so I think in the LPL environment their impact will be limited in Spring.

\- If I've overvalued SwordArt I'm so happy to be wrong on this one.

&amp;#x200B;

\#8 - Rare Atom (Previously Vici Gaming)

&amp;#x200B;

Top - Cube

Jungle - Leyan / Aix

Mid - FoFo

Adc - iBoy

Support - Hang / Maestro

&amp;#x200B;

\- Vici were on the cusp of making playoffs in 2020 Spring and Summer; from what I saw at Demacia cup they've developed to be worthy as a Top 8 team.

\- FoFo was a huge roster upgrade and it broke him free of the drama on BLG, he's an incredibly mechanically talented mid laner who can have a team build into him

\- The development of the players on this roster in 2020 + iBoy getting back to his strengths give RA (Rare Atom or Ra Ra Rasputin) a serious chance to continue momentum as a playoff team in 2021.

&amp;#x200B;

\#7 - BLG

&amp;#x200B;

Top - BiuBiu

Jungle - Meteor

Mid - Zeka

Adc - Aiming

Support - Mark

&amp;#x200B;

\- BLG also massively powered up their bottom lane who were abyssmal at best. Aiming has been seen as a giga carry and Mark has just come back off of his first Worlds.

\- While BiuBiu is a sort of side-grade and Zeka is a downgrade from FoFo, it does mean that Meteor is finally free of that weird dramatic shackle (please ask reddit comments for full story between him and FoFo). Meteor was Rookie of 2019 and was a top 3 jungler, only to plummet in 2020.

\- The players on this roster are all people with massive ceilings (BiuBiu from V5 one of the best solo killers in 2020 Summer, Meteor having insane games in 2019, Zeka praised as an OP rookie on VG, Aiming talked about from the LCK &amp; Mark getting so much better). This is like the stars are aligning and I would be surprised if they didnt take a playoff spot.

&amp;#x200B;

\#6 - V5 

&amp;#x200B;

Top - Langx / Aliez

Jungle - WeiWei

Mid - Mole

Adc - Y4 

Support - PPGod

&amp;#x200B;

\- The same roster apart from the top lane, however, Langx is a flat upgrade to BiuBiu and is an incredbily versatile top laner. This roster got better imo.

\- WeiWei had an insane debut to the LPL in 2020 and was a big reason for the success in making V5 into that hero story in Summer (alongside blessed PPGod, of course). Their shotcalling and a quickly developed V5 makes it near impossible to not put V5 in playoffs once again.

\- Losing SamD when Y4 is essentially the same faciliting ADC doesnt make much of a difference and fans should be excited to see how far V5 can go

&amp;#x200B;

\#5 - FPX

&amp;#x200B;

Top - Nuguri

Jungle - Tian

Mid - Doinb 

Adc - Lwx / Prince

Support - Crisp

&amp;#x200B;

\- One of the most talked about roster moves with 2020 World Champion Nuguri replacing the long standing Gimgoon &amp; more recent Khan (Funny how they swapped). This gives a lot of raw power to the topside of FPX; something they've never really had or known how to play towards (with Khan especially)

\- Biggest concerns right now are Tian's Wrist Issues, LWX &amp; Crisp's average performances &amp; FPX's ability to be flexible with their style. A lot of their success was built on how well they played the map in 2019 and used Doinb + Tian as strong facilitators to beat down the doors of games.

\- This team is suffering from many issues but is still good enough overall for me to rate them in the top 5; Nuguri is incredible but one great memeber is not enough to push them into the top 4; as seen by Khan's failed integration in 2020.

&amp;#x200B;

\#4 - IG

&amp;#x200B;

Top - TheShy

Jungle - Xun / Ning (Technically Inactive)

Mid - Rookie

Adc - Wink / Puff / Snow

Support - Baolan / Lucas / Southwind

&amp;#x200B;

\- Putting the most inconsistent team here as many fans will know is risky business. IG flopped hard against LGD and missed out on going to Worlds. However, like usual, their ceiling has been seen to be this Top 4 level of good

\- As well as the usual antics, IG have their IG Young  Jungler starting over Ning (who is currently inactive), Xun is the same jungler who won the LDL in Summer. IG now also has Wink over from Estar who had a great showing in 2020 Spring LPL. There is a lot of potential for everything to go right, plus the fact that players fighting for a starting spot can only be a good thing for the team environment.

\- I said this on stream; Rookie carries this team so damn hard and is also a big reason I've put them in the top 4. He had one of his best years in 2020 and his laning phase was unmatched. The problem for Rookie is who's mess in IG he has to clean up and why is TheShy also inting!?

&amp;#x200B;

\#3 - Team WE

&amp;#x200B;

Top - Breathe (Previously Curse)

Jungle - Beishang

Mid - Shanks / TeacherMa / Yimeng

Adc - Jiumeng

Support - Missing

&amp;#x200B;

\- This is probably my biggest take next to Suning, considering WE were a team in 2020 that were a 6-8th Playoff team. WE not only made it to the finals of Demacia Cup with this roster but improved so much over the course of 2020 that this feels warrented.

\- Breathe is a huge upgrade over Morgan who dissapointed me greatly last year. Breathe was the starting top laner for OMG and was consistently trying to 1v9 in a hard team environment; now no longer. On top of Breathe, you have Beishang who turned into a top 3-4 Jungler in the LPL, Jiumeng who went from bad to great in the span of 2020 and Missing who remained one of the best supports in the LPL. This team has rising talent that is no ones equal. 

\- I think this team holds consistency and versatile elements that are hungry for a Championship; Team WE just need to continue their pursuit and it feels like the path is realistically a finals position in Summer; if not Spring.

\- The only thing that can stop WE is Shanks, he looked okay at Demacia Cup but is definitely the blaring weakness of this team right now.

&amp;#x200B;

\#2 - JDG

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Top - Zoom

Jungle - Kanavi

Mid - Yagao / Xiye

Adc - Loken / Mystic

Support - LvMao

&amp;#x200B;

\- While they were dissapointing at Worlds, they're still one of the most powerful rosters in the LPL; and that was BEFORE they took Xiye and Mystic to have alternating greats in Mid and ADC (Good to see 2017 WE reunited in some way :)).

\- Even without this, JDG would have the top 2 in every role bar perhaps those Mids and ADCs(?). 

\- Kanavi is a big driving force and can often come up clutch in a lot of crucial moments (Finals/Playoffs especially). You want to see him take over the jungle and bring his laners to him to force on his advantages.

\- I'm selling a horse to a horse salesmen; JDG are still a cut above almost all

&amp;#x200B;

\#1 - TES

&amp;#x200B;

Top - 369

Jungle - Karsa

Mid - Knight

Adc - JackeyLove / Photic

Support - Zhuo / YYJ

&amp;#x200B;

\- This one was just plain obvious; it doesn't matter that they dropped out to Suning at Worlds, they still have high expectations coming into Spring.

\- And holy shit was Zhuo good at Demacia Cup, he took initiative and worked so well with JKL on the rift. Even off of the rift in press interviews they have great chemistry so I think this is the missing piece. 

\- If Zhuo wasn't in the picture I might have thrown JDG in 1st but I honestly think this roster is unstoppable now. With the same great elements on top of a now coordinated driving force in the bottom lane; how do you beat this team?

leagueoflegends,2021,1,"So I have some thoughts. Let's say Thresh and Quinn were on the same team on Summoner's Rift and Thresh threw his lantern to Quinn to shield/bubble her during a heated fight with an enemy champion. Now let's say Quinn dashed towards the enemy champion using E while still being in the protective bubble/shield, by dashing to the enemy champion, she is literally in the enemy's face, so my question is this, since the souls are actively shielding her in a bubble during this time, what impact would it have on the enemy champion, when she is dashing right into them with E? Won't the shield/bubble (in theory) collide with the enemy champion that she is dashing to? What or how it would feel like being hit by the shield from the perspective of the champion that is fighting Quinn in this scenario? Would the shield/bubble make any sort of collision and/or impact with the enemy champion upon her dashing to said enemy?

Same for champions like Morgana, Nautilus, etc. 

So it doesn't matter if you are good or bad at this champion, you can int for 99% of the game but in the final fight you hit your cc chain and die, your team can still win the fight.

Why would a good Leona and bad Leona have the same level of threat to the other team? Makes no sense. 

So there should be a stats called something like cc power, which is anchored to items, More items with cc power enables you to cc longer. Like everything else, attack speed, ad, ap, mr, amor.... all should be bought with gold, not naturally gained. For example Leona Q can only cc for 0.1 sec unless she buys more cc power.

Why not? If tenacity is gained by gold, the other way around should too.",2021-01-03 23:10:04
leagueoflegends,2021,1,"So, this is a strange idea, but hear me out. There's a couple of weird things going on with Imperial Mandate and Everfrost. **I bolded my main points because I like to ramble, but I appreciate those who are insane enough to read the entire thing :D.**

Let's start with Everfrost. Everfrost has such a slow cast time and low range that it acts more like a Crowd Control extender or a melee disengage tool than what GLP was, which set up combos for champions such as Sylas and Veigar. **As such, Everfrost acts more like a defensive supportive tool that rarely gets picked, if ever, by DPS AP champions because they opt for, well, damage.** That's kind of their thing. Even with champs that revolve around hard CC like Anivia or Taliyah, they simply go for Luden's or Liandry's\*\*. In most champions where Everfrost is even considered an option, it falls under a 5% pickrate\*\*.

Now let's talk about Imperial Mandate. Imperial Mandate has been a curious design for Enchanters especially considering that one of the major concerns of s11 has been damage creep. **Despite Enchanters being classified as shielders and buffers, it seems like a large oddity that they were given an entirely DPS-focused item that seems more suited towards poke supports rather than Enchanters.** So much so that Imperial Mandate has seen play by characters such as Aurelion Sol and Ashe, and I'm sure champions like Aurelion Sol and other Battlemages and Control Mages would love to have that item more suited towards them.

Limiting the focus to Enchanters, those who pick Imperial Mandate rarely opt for anything else because it's just that effective, so much so that it has divided the Enchanter role in half: Healers (Yuumi, Sona, Soraka) and CC Enchanters (Janna, Nami, Karma). This distinction is important when you consider this: **CC Enchanters who build Imperial Mandate primarily can also utilize Moonstone Renewer effectively; Healers who build Moonstone Renewer primarily cannot utilize Imperial Mandate effectively.** This contention is normally lost when discussing the diversity of what Enchanters can and can build since one subsection of Enchanters clearly has more opportunities. That being said, the diversity of support mythics in general is disappointing, especially in regards to Engage supports, but that's a different topic for another time.

So how do we resolve all these issues? Well, what if...we swapped what the roles these mythics were intended for? Think about it. Swap the costs and recipes of the Mythic items and tweak the stats. **Both mythic passives give 15 AP/legendary item anyways, and both mythics give AP, AH, and Health too; so their stats, recipe, and cost can be easily exchanged and adjusted .** The only difference is Mana vs. Mana Regeneration which...is also very similar. **In addition, make Mandate proc off of any attack, sort of like a Crowd Control Spellblade that can be a novel addition to skill expression in terms of ability combos.**

If Imperial Mandate was designated towards being an AP mythic, **champions like Aurelion Sol, Swain, and Anivia suddenly have** **a much better CC-synergy mythic that enhances their kit.** Additionally, with the removal of Rod of Ages, this  change **provides stats that poke mages usually don't need like Health to fill in a gap that battlemages like Ryze lost**. This could provide an opportunity for a decision between Liandry's Torment and Everfrost, providing different ways of defense and offense.

If Everfrost was designed towards being an Enchanter mythic, **healers like Sona, Soraka, and Yuumi can have an actual decision between mythics, opting for either Healing and Ability Haste with Moonstone or Crowd Control and Ability Power with Everfrost.** This can also be used to **expand upon skill expression that Enchanters lost with the removal of Athene's.** It can also allow for Enchanters to be more favoured in pro play with some pretty ingenious plays revolving around the CC Enchanters and Everfrost. Imagine a clutch Janna combo involving some combination of W, Q, R, and Everfrost. It's like Galeforce Samira...except actually good.

At the very least, it's a nice thought experiment and a clean resolution to problems revolving around the design of these very similar mythics. What do you guys think?

I've ended up with 3000+ points to spend come the 11th. I was wondering what was better to spend it on, I don't care for any of the rif raf and decided on Orbs or Chests.

 I've started designing shoes that were inspired by LoL and I wanted to  know what themes, skins, etc. members of the league community would like  to see. My first pair (pictured) was inspired by the spirit blossom theme,  one of my favorite aesthetics. I would like to make a pair inspired by  dark star or maybe battle queens but I'm not making them for myself so  I'm asking for input from the community. My plan is to make 4-5 more  pairs to have as examples then start taking commissions. I might also  make a pair inspired by one of the professional teams such as SKT if  anyone would be in to that. Let me know in the comments what part of LoL  you would like to see brought to life!

leagueoflegends,2021,1,One of my best ARAM plays in 2020 on Nunu,2021-01-03 23:44:54
leagueoflegends,2021,1,"The honor-punishment system in League is a typical carrot-and-stick one. The carrot is Grey Warwick and some old Twitch skin. The stick is having to pay 5$ for another account off of e-bay, or less severely, losing a skin for a champ you probably don't play. The fundamental issue here is that Riot's carrot is very small, and the stick is very small as well. What this means is that nobody is incentivized to be a good sportsman, and nobody is scared away from being toxic. The motivation to being polite is *purely* internal, which is, clearly, not enough for most people, at times including even myself (think of the shopping cart theory).

Now we have all heard the typical arguments for giving better honor rewards and having a more transparent honor system: the carrot isn't big enough, players deserve more from Riot, etc. I think it's agreed upon that there is no material benefit to being a good sportsman in League of Legends. 

Whenever this argument comes up, I often hear that ""players don't deserve rewards for being good people in the game"", which, I guess if you prefer that brand of draconian interpretation, is fine. But I think those naysayers are looking at the problem incorrectly.

This is how I see it: As new players come in and learn to play the game, they will instantly be barraged by flame, harassment, and toxicity, and as a result either quit playing, turn off the chat (thereby lowering community engagement and contributing to the mindset that the worst part of League is it's culture), or join the toxicity themselves. When in Rome. Effectively, toxicity is a vicious cycle.

Making a different colored recall and a profile banner would not be very high effort on Riot's end, but giving any sort of meaningful honor reward, if it reduced toxicity even by 10% would contribute to reducing toxicity over all. If just one player chooses not to flame a noob so that they don't lose their profile banner or honor skin, then that person has a better experience, encouraging *him* not to be toxic, and so on and so forth. It may sound fanciful, but at the end of the day these changes are slow and gradual, not fast. The way it is right now, that Riot promises you a reward and then gives you an insulting gift-bag, makes it seem that not even Riot cares about dealing with the toxicity problem in their game, so why the hell should your average player?

(On a tangent: Riot should totally offer priority queue and autofill protection as honor rewards. Even things like IGN changes would be awesome goodies that are low effort on Riot's part).

You can never truly be rid of toxicity in this game, as at the end of the day LoL is a skill based game where your teammates can lose it for you. Nothing in a game will make you angrier than getting out of lane 7/1 and losing to a Master Yi who cleaned up your four teammates who couldn't game their way out of a paper bag. But doing *anything* to reduce toxicity even a little would be a great thing for the game.

**TLDR: If better honor rewards convince enough people to be less toxic, it could drag up the whole community with it.",2021-01-03 23:46:21

While tactically it wouldn't benefit you it would add an interesting dynamic to face checking the fog particularly for baron or Drake fights. Sending the tank ahead god knows if the enemy just 5 stacked him or if he's just caught a half hp kog maw out of position, or if your adc rotating mid stopped to do raptors or is kiting a sejuani or getting one shot by zed. It may be annoying but I think it'd be cooler than how it is now and make the map generally more interesting with more interactions. Granted certain strats or champs like fiddles or assassin's or 5 stacking gets more powerful but then again that might work inversely too.

Now, your gut reaction is probably like ""What the fuck are you talking about? BRAUM?""  


Yeah, Braum. The mustached shield man of no shirt. I am of the believe that no other melee champion can beat Braum 1 v 1 in top lane if he has Doran Blade + LT + Ignite  


His passive is a stun after 4 hits, which means not only do you get interrupted, but during that time you're stunned, his LT is getting stacked up. And then to further synergize with LT, all his autos after stunning you, do on hit magic damage for a short period of time.

leagueoflegends,2022,1,"Let's just say the friends I play with are not very experienced in league. They probably have an MMR somewhere in bronze but improving rapidly. We typically only play ARAM or the rotational game modes if available. When I play solo, everything is fine. I typically get matched with people my skill level and maybe a single smurf on the other team which is not a big deal. The game goes well, and it's enjoyable for the most part. I've won 16/20 games when playing solo. 

But man, when I play with my friends, it's smurf city and I have no idea why every game is a premade of smurfs. Last 6 games we've played were so low quality. The other team are all playing on iron/bronze 4 accounts and guess what, my friends and filler teammates are all actually bronze and the games are so incredibly unfun. I understand smurfing is hard to tackle, but my friends don't want to play anymore and when you call out the smurfs, they don't give a damn that they're ruining new/casual players experiences. 

My friends and I just want to enjoy this gamemode, as they like it over ARAM, but we're just stuck playing aram forever at this point because we don't typically get smurfs. The reason I'm posting this is because we just played and incredibly frustrating game against smurf premades, and when confronted, they told us to ""play against bots"" while they're the ones indifferent about making this game toxic for us. I know this game mode isn't supposed to be serious, but it's also supposed to be FUN, and fun doesn't exist, just us realizing it's going to be another 15 minute game over and over again. I don't think riot cares too much about improving matchmaking for ultimate spellbook, but I can't imagine the experience for casual/row rank players this is ruining. 

Should Riot do anything about this? The game mode does attract casual players, but it very quickly deters them due to horrible matchmaking and low quality games.",2022-01-01 02:19:36

leagueoflegends,2022,1,"You've all seen plenty of games with bots, because Riot can't seem to figure out that registration is one of the best tools to combat botted accounts. But when those bots start ruining ranked games, we have no recourse. Sure, MAYBE the account will get banned because other players on your team will think you're just being toxic (even when the bot account has a history of 10-20 deaths in every game and is heavily negative on the losing side of games) and report you instead, but that doesn't solve the issue at hand: You just lost your LP. Maybe worse, you're on a slump because you get matched against some smurf or an Irelia main who stomps your game, or an invincible Tahm Kench, etc, and now you just got demoted because you had a bot on your team that just walked at the enemy team.  


Remake needs to be something that triggers FAR more often, and there needs to be a means to negate losses from these bot accounts. There needs to be bigger opportunities beyond just someone having connection issues. A remake should trigger if a player is severely negative to the point of unreasonable (like, for example, one death every minute) and something beyond ""having a bad game"" or ""skill gap"" judgment. You can easily tell when an AI can't make up a decision and it starts dancing back and forth unable to process. Likewise when someone does not respond to any prompting, pings, etc, it's very likely that they are an even lower tier of bot that doesn't have reactive scripts in it's subroutine.",2022-01-01 02:42:10

I have played a number of other Esport Competitive titles, and CSGO is the game I use as an example. Previously, to win a CSGO match, you needed to reach the 16th victory, but if the opposing team plays on par with your team, the match will last up to nearly 1 hour. Valve could have realized this and launched a shorter game mode, which is the 8th win

leagueoflegends,2022,1,"Hello, I spent hours in testing and calculating in practice tool, and I can say for sure that Shadowflame is NOT giving the Magic pen it is supposed to give. 

The description in game says ""max benefit when the target has 1000 or less health""

The description from wiki says basically the same but more detailed :   
Formula: 10 + 1 for every -150 target's current health starting from 2500 target's current health and capped at 1000 target's current health.  
Source : [https://leagueoflegends.fandom.com/wiki/Shadowflame?so=search](https://leagueoflegends.fandom.com/wiki/Shadowflame?so=search) (hover the passive description on the right of the page to get the formula)

**Unless it is a bug specific to the practice tool, which I highly doubt, Shadowflame is granting 1.6 to 2.9 less magic pen than intended/stated in the tooltip**. It's not a gamebreaking bug, but nobody seem to be aware of that and this bug persists at least since Shadowflame went live (probably was already on PBE but I did not test there)

I tried on different champions and I never saw Shadowflame working as intended. The easiest way to test is to remove any damaging rune that could interfere, then start a practice tool.  
Buy only shadowflame, put a target dummy with minimum health (1000) and 20 MR.   
Attack the target dummy with a simple spell that does a single instance of damage like annie Q.  
Note the result, then sell Shadowflame, and buy instead sorcerer shoes + needlessly large wand + blasting wand to have the same AP than shadowflame.  
Attack again the target dummy with that new build using the same spell like above and note the result.  
In both situations you have 100 AP so your base damage in the same, only Mpen changes with the 2 builds. Since target has 1000 hp or less, shadowflame is supposed to grant 20 Mpen against that target, and pre mitigation damage should be equal to post mitigation damage (you have 20 mpen and target has 20MR, but the values are always lower than the predictions because in that case, for some reason in that situation Shadowflame gives 17.1 Mpen instead of 20.  
Additonally, the sorcerer shoes 100 ap build always do slightly more damage than Shadowflame only.  
But you are supposed to benefit from 2 additional magic pen against 1000 HP targets when you shadowflame instead of sorc shoes.  
After making the math, I could find out that Shadowflame grants 17.1 Magic Pen exactly on targets with 1000 current health or less. I tried to reduce target below 1000 current health to try but it always give the same results than 1000 hp target, so it does not scale below 1000 current health as stated in the tooltip. Also it grants 8.4 magic pen instead of the intended 10 on targets with 2500 current health or above, and it doesn't decrease further as the health of target increase.

The general formula to calculate post mitigation damage is :   
Post mitigation damage = base damage\*100/(100+armor)  
It is the same formula for magic resist and ability haste  
Source : [https://leagueoflegends.fandom.com/wiki/Armor?so=search](https://leagueoflegends.fandom.com/wiki/Armor?so=search)  
Graph for ability haste into cdr or armor/mr into damage reduction : [https://www.desmos.com/calculator/atkt8mr6qf?lang=fr](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/atkt8mr6qf?lang=fr)

So what I did next is picking Annie because her Q is simple for tests, I removed any rune that give any offensive benefit to not interfere with the test, I went for Shadowflame/Rabaddon/Lost chapter/Spellthief edge, which granted me exactly 374 AP so my Q does exactly 500 base damage at rank 5.

Then I put a target dummy with 20 mr and I tested my Q damage on it for each HP value possible.  
I tested for 888, 1000, 1100, 1200, 1300, 1400, 1500, 1600, 1700, 1800, 1900, 2000, 2100, 2200, 2300, 2400, 2500, 2600 hp  
(For the 888, it's 2 auto before Qing at Annie level 9, was just to make sure the magic pen doesn't increase further if target goes below 1000 current health)

Here you can see all my data in a google sheet screenshot :  [https://ibb.co/8b22D3Q](https://ibb.co/8b22D3Q)  
You can easily reproduce my results step by step with all the infos I gave.  
For the **Expected Mpen** column, I am just following the wiki chart (but from my testing, the formula is linear and not working per 150 health threshold as stated in the wiki - but it's really a detail, whatever.  
For the **Calculated Mpen**, the formula is : MR-(-100\*Post mitigation damage+100\*500)/Post mitigation damage  
For the **Expected dom,** the formula is just 500\*100/(100+MR - Expected Mpen)  
The **Damage done** is just the post mitigation damage displayed on my screen at the moment my spell hit

The column about the damage done with sorcerer shoes instead of Shadowflame is meant to confirm there is no error in formula or math, in that column every observed result match with the expected result. (Specifically, 500 base damage on a 20 mr target when you have 18 magic pen turns into 490.2 post mitigation damage which is what the formula predicted. 500\*100/(100+2) = 490.19

This is by the way what should happen with Shadowflame on the 1300 and 1400 current health target but the damage done is 478 and 475 instead of 490.19 because the Mpen granted by Shadowflame is 15.4 and 14.7 instead of 18 and 18.

Additionally, I did not test against shield but I assume I would get the same values than I get while attacking a 1000 hp target or below.   
Also for those who wondered, it works as usual Magic pen for the void staff interaction (and similar effects like morde E passive), the % magic pen is applied BEFORE the flat magic pen, just like sorcerer shoes.

**TLDR** : **Unless it is a bug specific to the practice tool, which I highly doubt, Shadowflame is granting 1.6 to 2.9 less magic pen than intended/stated in the tooltip, depending on enemy current health**

It's obviously not intended. And it's lasting for very long already. Any thoughts? I'm going to contact support to ask and see what they answer. If you think I am missing something, feel free to correct, but I really triple checked all the informations I gave there!",2022-01-01 05:28:21

leagueoflegends,2022,1,"It's not about matchups, it's not about ""counterpicking"" or any of that shit... assuming there isn't a monumental difference in skill... the better champ always wins. 

Like, pick any AD assassin, and have someone else pick Zoe. It doesn't matter if that person has 5M mastery on Zoe and has been no lifing the champ since her release... there's just nothing that Zoe can do about some braindead one shot machine clicking on her with their entirely targeted kit -- even if she lands her abilities, there's 20 runes and items to save the assassin's ass... and all Zoe's got is Zhonya's, which really just delays her death for a second under normal circumstances.

Then look at top lane. Pick any tank, versus any bruiser. There is quite literally nothing the tank can do to that bruiser, to the extent they can't even win or even hold their lane without jungler intervention.

Look at support. Unless you have hard engage or you're a mage pretending to be a support... you have no agency at all. You just have to hope someone on your team is less than braindead, or you lose automatically.

I think it would be of benefit if under 20s are grouped together, above 30s grouped together etc...I see no actual downside to it except a smallish increase in queue times, which for me does not matter, would rather have like-minded teammates and wait for 5 mins, then have completely not like-minded teammates and wait for 2 mins...

Kids would play with kids, be super competitive, aim for win, be toxic if losing and so on

Meanwhile over 30s would focus mostly on troll champs or builds, drink beer, crack stupid jokes and sur at 15 while winning because why not, its fun and stupid

Not saying all would, and for sure it would be better to differentiate by for ex. a survey or game-mode, because currently the fun people are in ARAM and toxic in Rift, which is a shame since I prefer rift map, but would prefer being with fun people, but survey and stuff takes time, this can be turned on a jiffy...

It doesn’t feel like this problem comes up few to the lack of characters, but rather when playing a champ I find myself feeling torn when I loose a game. Every character has pros and cons to keep the game balanced, but either an enemy has a champ that looks better/cooler to play or I feel like my champ lacks something.

leagueoflegends,2022,1,"If the verbal toxicity bot is able to detect toxic behaviour and this behaviour is never allowed; why is this system not made to screen what people type and simply produce blank fields as output from offensive input. Some words like the N word are homophobic slurs are never allowed why can a person still produce them (there is even an offensive language filter so it's not like the technology of toxicity bot can't be matched with live chat).  


So if starting today Riot would decide that (the system also recognizes context to some degree; as we know by the automated feedback produced by the bot):  
Angry person: I hope you die dirty N word  
Output: I hope \*cuddles my friend\*

OR

Output: I hope (followed by nothing)

OR

Output: warning text: if you feel heated take a small break (or something similar: only visible to you and nothing being posted in chat; seems like the best solution to me)  


To me implementing this seems so logical (why is it even possible to say N word or homophobic slurs). The part that makes me wonder if I am paranoid is the answer I keep gravitating towards when asking myself this question:  
This is not being implemented because Riot knows toxicity in all it's forms is perceived as a major (probaby the biggest problem) in league. But unlike verbal toxicity the other forms of toxic behaviour are extremely difficult to punish with an automated system without a high risk of false positives (and would probably require trained personel actively monitoring/watching live games which would cost a ton of money and not be feasible).   


We all know that perception/media is everything and he whom loses control of the perception risks major damage to it's brand. If riot would have the option to overnight make verbal abuse a thing of the past would this be in their best interest (in my opinion they have this power); my answer is NO! They would be left with the problem the majority of people are actually discontent about (the griefing, the trolling/running it down etc.).   
But unlike verbal abuse it is very hard to produce feedback for consumers to see they are addressing something in regards to these problems; so less instant feedback reports, less impressive stats that problems are being adressed (we punished X people which is a higher percentage/number than last year guys so we are cleaning the streets! type of messages). Which would make them lose the grip on how they are perceived in regard to this subject; leading to possible extreme damage to their brand.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: Riot could very easily eradicate the vast majority of toxicity they are PUNISHING for. However, because they are unable to actually address the toxicity they are not able to punish, they need to keep the category that they are able to address ""alive"" to please the public eye.

- In case the enemy team wins (we are gonna use this term to talk about the team without the troll player), the team that has the troll will lose no LP or get a loss mitigation like when someone goes afk. The enemy team gets normal LP gain.

- In case the team with the troll wins, the troll player will get no lps.

In both situations the player marked as troll will be queue locked from ranked for 1 day and the system will be able to analyze the game to better detect this sort of behaviour in a future. Consecutive queue lock outs will increase the lock out time and will result in an investigation to see if this player deserves to be banned.

With this system the enemy team gets no beneffit at all for voting the troll player, the only reason would be to punish someone that is indeed ruinning games, and since you need the majority of both teams to vote this won't be abusable by premades or by a a losing team to mitigate LP gains

Obviously this is only a prototype and will need adjustments but I think it will be a way to get rid of the most obvious soft inters.",2022-01-01 14:00:12

leagueoflegends,2022,1,"Let's discuss top lane and why the role is good and why it's bad and things that just feel plain terrible.

My favorite thing is that top lane is the ultimate 1v1 me bro type of lane where you interact with the rest of the map less than any other role.

Easily the number one hands down biggest issue of top lane this season is lethal tempo, you know the rune that let's Yone, Trundle, Irelia, Jax, Tryndamere and more run you down from level 1 unless you pick one of their hard counters, and even then some traditional hard counters no longer beat them.  Most of these champs were already considered toxic to play against.  The fact that a champ like Yone who's meant to be weak early can survive and even hard win in top lane vs most matchups is a joke in itself.  The fact you can get about 2000 gold worth of stats at level 1 without a CD to play around is just bonkers and I can't believe anyone thought this was a good idea.  Conqueror only gives about 500 gold worth of stats and the duration lasts less time and falls off instantly.

The other issue that's become more and more of a problem is the amount of times when the 1v1 skill of the top laners matters less because jungle is having too large of an impact.  Hard outplaying your opponent but the enemy jungler decides to camp your lane congrats unless your jungler does the same you don't get to play the game.

While the lane is meant to be a 1v1 type island, winning your island should bring benefits to your team, the TP change on the PBE feels terrible.  Hard winning your lane and want to sacrifice a wave to help your team win that important dragon fight, well now you can't.  TP allowed top lane to be the ultimate 1v1 island while still mattering.  Want to help your feeding bot lane TP, it feels bad to be winning your island but your bot lane is 0-10 and the enemy team got all the drakes because of it, at least with teleport you get some sort of say, after the TP change top feels like a worthless role.

Last the fact that a champ like Akshan or Vayne is playable as a top laner is just pure aids Vayne is broken thanks to lethal tempo and Akshan is just a terrible design that I really wish never made it into league.  Stealth reveive insane mobility it's like they took every mechanic people hate and put it all on one champ.",2022-01-01 15:21:24

leagueoflegends,2022,1,"So I play as an ADC at the moment, I always hated Yasuo since release (damn you CertainlyT).  
But nowadays we have lots of people who know how to play him well, it's not 2014 anymore, Shieldbow gave him lots of survivability, Lethal Tempo and Lifesteal give him lots of power and little ways to counterplay.  


Now the most obnoxious non-ultimate spell in the game, in my opinion, is Wind Wall. Countering almost every ranged champion with 0 interactions, it's cooldown may be long, but still, costs 0 mana and if used well enough is basically a 4 second immune against certain champions. If you can't dash out of it's way, or if there's minions nearby, you'll be juggled, there's also the hitbox, stronger Yasuo Players know how to use it, the wall is thick enough that Yasuo can be on its center and not be hit by anything.

So, my proposal is that Yasuo is really tanky enough right now due to itemization, we don't need the Wind Wall to be thick anymore, it should just be thin, if you don't know and wanna test out, the wall is really extremely thick, hitting from the side of the wall will result in your shots getting deflected, and this interaction is really bullshit, let us hit from the side of the wind wall, make him move more if we're needing to move as well.",2022-01-01 16:02:47

leagueoflegends,2022,1,"First Strike is obviously a controversial rune because it literally gives gold just for hitting people. Which I guess is fine, the rune is pretty balanced on most champions. But good lord, this rune is so infuriatingly strong.

I want to start with who I think is the primary abuser of this rune: Gangplank. Most of the games I see Gangplank in, he tops the gold charts. And it's not even close. Just build Prowler's claw/Triforce and do some absolutely obscene damage that, would you know it, increases your gold even more so you can buy more items after!

&amp;#x200B;

[This is my Irelia. I have 13 kills and 291 cs.](https://preview.redd.it/7f0d0dg1k3981.png?width=226&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e9c7fdb44e2246db68c80729d81c5f1ccd80177e)

&amp;#x200B;

[This is the enemy Gangplank. 9 kills, 238 cs. ](https://preview.redd.it/nslp3775k3981.png?width=217&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=85dd9952a1b62ff9c489887658c0a9aae84db307)

The game was pretty close throughout. No team was winning by more than 4k gold until the enemy pulled away at the very end. Gangplank started off lane like 1/4, so he got a couple shutdowns. That's fine, I got a couple shutdowns too off of fed enemies. Based off these stats, I should have more gold than Gangplank. Even if he gets turrets (I think we had even turrets) our gold should be even at worst. Right?

&amp;#x200B;

[This is the gold graph at the end of the game. Gangplank got 3.5k more than me. This is, of course, down 4 kills and 50 cs. ](https://preview.redd.it/i4cub9n0l3981.png?width=289&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6d3b77073b0316ca5b8dbe95c7153aea994dff2f)

Here's another example:

&amp;#x200B;

[This is my Jax. Kind of a poor game, but still respectable 11 kills and 324 cs.](https://preview.redd.it/26ftcjkpl3981.png?width=227&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=43e776e8b39f026fb79c9cb15664d29f26a0ae0f)

&amp;#x200B;

[This is the enemy Gangplank. 373 cs, 15 kills. ](https://preview.redd.it/ikxpp2iul3981.png?width=226&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bb65dc1e8c197c51d2af97f4275b78751d3c8208)

In this game, the enemy was leading the entire game. So there were no objective bounties, no shutdowns, etc.

Obviously, the Gangplank got the better of me. So a decent gold lead would be fair. A couple thousand maybe, considering I was getting some shutdowns?

&amp;#x200B;

[This is the gold graph at the end of the game. A 4 kill and 50 cs deficit warrants a 6.5k gold lead? Since when? Also notable: the Vi had 19 kills and the Aphelios had 17 kills \(albeit worse cs numbers. But that doesn't cover 6k gold!\)](https://preview.redd.it/o4k2q8uhm3981.png?width=296&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2ca876992529c9e5ddf0359f6fa701d48520ebfb)

Obviously, two game examples doesn't tell the full story. Well, here are some other interesting statistics! On Lolalytics, Gangplank ranks #1 in highest gold income. 

&amp;#x200B;

[These are his exact stats. Patch 11.24, Plat+.](https://preview.redd.it/virrzrs2n3981.png?width=308&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a1f4abc68a1c0680b9f2bb972db1439317c21335)

Stats without context are meaningless. 

&amp;#x200B;

[These are Gangplank's stats on Patch 11.22, one patch before preseason \(and before the introduction of First Strike\).](https://preview.redd.it/8tb5gkh7n3981.png?width=312&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=959b17e7e8059c3769450affced38155d90001d1)

So Gangplank's gold income has increased by around 800 since the start of preseason. That, in my opinion, is absolutely nuts.

Let me note that Gangplank is a skill-intensive champion. So these Plat+ stats based on the average playerbase don't really do him justice. I'll just take Solarbacca, one of the more known Challenger Gangplank players.

&amp;#x200B;

[These are his Season 11 stats on Gangplank. Mostly in line with the average.](https://preview.redd.it/3oiilznap3981.png?width=530&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c62774586f24a2a5ca2ea946dcf0c23c320c8d81)

&amp;#x200B;

[These are his stats for the past 30 days. Note that his gold\/min has gone up an astonishing \(!!!\) 55 gold per minute.](https://preview.redd.it/2b0e74sfp3981.png?width=490&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=386de7b7d2e186900a55ce66a671d8e09d607642)

Let's take another player. 

[This is the rank 1 Gangplank on leagueofgraphs. Obviously he's not the absolute best, this is probably just a smurf. But we'll stick with these stats, which are from season 11.](https://preview.redd.it/fuw0yrxvp3981.png?width=496&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1dfeb58c0ccd86cbf0b93df927cfe8adaa5e2d14)

&amp;#x200B;

[These are his stats for the past 30 days. Note the gold\/min increased by \(!!!\) 58 gold.](https://preview.redd.it/qwglm831q3981.png?width=493&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6c0cdfabbc22d605bb92fda190702fe8b82834d3)

So this gold-earned discrepancy is even more extreme among otps. 

Maybe Gangplank is an outlier. Well, let's see.

&amp;#x200B;

[These are Jayce's stats on Patch 11.19, the World's patch. Remember, Jayce had a 55.4&amp;#37; presence at World's on this patch. ](https://preview.redd.it/vkl0o631o3981.png?width=302&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e0fd2bc7460f989e49b622be694285bb83fd9aa0)

&amp;#x200B;

[These are Jayce's stats on Patch 11.24. He has an even more egregious 1k gold increase.](https://preview.redd.it/4j56stk9o3981.png?width=308&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d7414a0976b9548785a728bf6e1b99b7397d1d84)

Just one more. Bear with me here.

&amp;#x200B;

[Viktor's stats on Patch 11.22. Mid-tier pick, not that good.](https://preview.redd.it/pbuotzdio3981.png?width=302&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cf5354e48147f64a81d9624e095dbe7693bcd79b)

&amp;#x200B;

[This is Viktor on Patch 11.24. S-tier pick \(not necessarily because of First Strike, but it certainly contributes\). His gold generation has gone up 600g.](https://preview.redd.it/x2xga6jmo3981.png?width=308&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d39a9542e56a390cd8a0decdfddd069b17c5240d)

I don't know if it's just me, but this rune just seems completely out of line. It is polarizing champ select, because certain champions can earn gold much, much faster. I'm not sure how we can even balance this rune (maybe delete it? lol) but champions earning 500-1000 gold on average just from this rune seems insane to me. I think we need to ask ourselves if we want this kind of cheese in the game. It's simply earning gold through brainless fighting, and at no risk for champions like Jayce or Viktor. I think we're in for a very rude awakening if this rune stays unchanged through preseason and pro play comes around. We'll see Bin and The Shy abusing Gangplank and Jayce with quite little counterplay. 

These stats speak for themselves. The average player benefits largely from this rune. The OTPs benefit largely from this rune. First Strike gives way, way too many resources in the midgame for very little damage tradeoff. And let's not forget that taking this rune allows you to go biscuits, boots, and cpot for more added sustain!

Please, save just a bit of my mental. Let's change this rune. We can make it a New Year's Resolution or something!

tl;dr: First strike is giving way too many resources and is too strong.",2022-01-01 16:28:30

Do supports out there actually think it's a good idea to leave their escape lacking ADC to fend for themselves against a 2v1 bot lane that has hard stuns? To be clear he never came back. A won lane was turned into a lost lane.

I would understand if I was doing terribly but I wasn't. I honestly don't get it but it keeps happening and the game is becoming unplayable without friends. No matter how good an ADC is 2v1 is not winnable/farmable against certain champs. Especially when Jinx's biggest weakness is lack of escape.",2022-01-01 18:44:06

leagueoflegends,2022,1,"""6% more damage against enemies with more hp than you"" is ridiculously niche, and unfun.

Adc's mow down bruisers much faster with it giving them 6% more damage against them for the majority of the fight against them. Assassins as well. This buff is also ridiculously overpowered on Tryndamere. It's almost impossible to win against a Trynd who get's 4 chemtech dragons. (24% damage buff during ult). 

This buff also is completely useless on any champions that are actually building health or have health in their kits such as sion, chogath, nasus, darius, garen, morde, etc.

**The base buff should be changed so it's valuable and worth getting for every champion.** Atm the only reason to get this dragon as a bruiser is ""so the other team doesn't get it"" which is really not the way a game should be designed",2022-01-01 20:47:25

The video linked below with Tyler1 basically shows this concept in a nutshell. 

To sum it up, he is in a perfectly winnable game and then his J4 jungle and Zed midlaner get heated over basically nothing and the J4 just completely throws the game into a loss because the zed ""didn't say sorry""

The worst is when people play like garbage, and then get called out for playing like garbage, and then start crying and running it because they're ego just can't handle it.

leagueoflegends,2022,1,"I didn't do a whole lot math wise or consider how busted or not busted this would be. This is purely for fun, and something that I'd consider fun on a marksman. If there is a subreddit for this, please link it as I have a few fun ideas that I'd also like to share. This champion is my idea, dm me if you're considering using it in any shape, form, or fashion.

Passive: Crag has top of the line chem-tech built into the suit, as such, he has increased capabilities over his fellow Zaunites. Fire fight: The more champion abilities and autos that Crag takes during an engagement, the more aggressive he feels he needs to become. Converting percentages of his auto attacks to true damage as he becomes more accurate

Q: BeaconCrag chooses a target and marks them, gaining move speed towards them as well as bonus range. Ability resets on takedown

W: BeatdownCrag does a spin attack with his non-dominant hand, stunning all in the range for ‘x’ time. If the target is marked with ‘Beacon’, the move speed becomes a general buff instead of just towards them.

E: Zaunite ElevatorPassive: Crag ignores minion unit collision while ability is down

Active: Crag leaps, using the first thing he hits as a jump post. If it’s a wall, the jump is doubled. If it’s a champion, he still chooses a direction; displacing the target away from said direction he goes. (Not unlike quinn, but with lucian dash range and camille secondary)

R: Chem-tech authorityToggle, costing X mana per x seconds, ramping like Kog/Kass ult

Crag pulls out a Piltover crystal enhanced rifle, with all the fits and trims a Zaunite could want. The weapon has increased range with ramping range against the champion he designates with his Beacon. This rifle is also magically weightless thanks to the gem, removing the need to stop to auto attack.

The mana cost resets on takedown

Crag uses a pistol as his main form of weaponized combat, though he has plenty of experience in unarmed combat. Relying on his custom weapon, he could fight his way through the lanes if he had to. The rifle he carries, folded in half, would look almost out of place if it didn’t have a litany of chem-tech adorning it. The shine that once held over this beautiful weapon, long gone. With how much of his gear is nothing more than cobbled together chem-gear, it’s all surprisingly well put together. There’re scuffs and scorches all over his gear, though metal still shows through it all, the weight seems to not be a concern to him. Magic stones, stolen straight from the pilty penthouses seem to run his suit and rifle. This is what gives him the edge now. He fought his way up to the top on scraps, now he’ll never forget his roots, and stay on top with his advantages

He has 550 base range

Beacon has his auto range +50/125/150/175/200 as the cast range, and extends his attack range to this extent against the marked character

His ultimate, when toggled, will also increase his attack range by 75/150/200. Mana cost will lower slightly, extending the duration he can use this ability by a semi-consistently usable margin",2022-01-01 20:56:02

leagueoflegends,2022,1,"No matter what class of champions you prefer, I believe that we can all agree on one thing ; the item overhaul has completely defeated the purpose of most classes.   

I mean, you can take a look at AD assassins, they have invis. Take a look at Marksmen, they have a shield. Take a look at mages, they have more anti-burst options other than Zhonya’s. If you told me all this a few years ago, I would have told you that you’re crazy.    

All classes have an item to solve their weaknesses, so in return everything is broken. That’s why we all hate the item overhaul so much, and we’re not wrong. Looking back at it now, what went wrong?

What was Riot’s intention with the item overhaul anyway?  Riot claims that the goal of the item rework was to “broaden players’ strategic choices”.  Seems like a good idea in theory right?  

1 whole season has passed and I believe we can all agree that this did not really happen..? Apart from SOME marksmen’ having 3 very unique options, I think most champions have a standard mythic item for every game.

leagueoflegends,2022,1,"I think it's about time to rework Jax, and I have some ideas.

First, design wise, we should just change it completely. He looks like a trash bag on 2 legs. I think turn him into a human. Everyone love humans! Then, I think that his purple color scheme is really ugly. Make it yellow! With the mix of silver here and there. I think we don't have a lot of yellow champion in game, right? Then, turn his mask into goggles, but make them BIG. I want to see his beautiful lips, but I still want him to have multiple eyes, because that's cool. Then, take away his lamp and turn it into a sword. I know, but let's be honest, lamp is pretty stupid. A blade is much more fitting for the grandmaster that he is. Also, to emphasise the fantasy of being the grandmaster, add several blades on his legs too. He might not use them, but at least he looks threatening, right?

Now, for his passive, I think instead of gaining attack speed, he should just attack twice. Kind of like old ult passive, but without the bonus damage. However, I think that would make on-hit and crit builds even stronger on him!

For his Q, he should teleport and kinda do several slashes. His leap was always boring. But with this ability, he looks cool AND enemies can't do anything to him while he is slicing them up. Finally, make cooldown decrease on each crit hit and make the ability damage being able to crit too. Just to add more crit synergy, of course!

For his W, he should meditate and restore health, while gaining damage reduction and gaining passive stacks. His old W is super boring. And you can still reset auto attacks using this too! With this, he really feels like some kinda master of yi energy. We can call him Master Yi, or something like that haha!

For his E, he should enhance all his auto attacks to deal bonus damage. Yep, like old W, but multiple times! And to make him actually balanced, since he loses his stun, he should instead deal true damage over the duration. 

And for his ult, he should become more deadly instead of just being more tanky. Come on, Jax! You should be a threat, after all! Let him gain more movement speed, immunity to slows, and bonus attack speed to compensate for his old passive loss. Also, make his ult extend on takedowns, kinda like how he challenges enemies one by one and immediately rushes in another battle! 

Now, since his new kit and look are set, we should please all old Jax fans too. I know that many people dislike huge changes for their champs, like in case with Aatrox or even Volibear. So, to please everyone, we should just take an already existing champion named Master Yi and pretty much turn him into old Jax. But what if Master Yi mains complain about the loss of their champion, you say? Fear not! I can assure you that new Jax will play pretty similar to old Master Yi, so everyone can be pleased!",2022-01-01 22:45:49

leagueoflegends,2022,1,"So I just watched arcane (EDIT: I started working on this again like months after I made this draft so..) like a week ago and probably my favorite non-champion character was Silco. Although I don't play this game anymore, I figured I share the design I created for him while I was at work. Yes, I also heard the news that Silco be in TFT and not league of legends. Anyways, enjoy!

&amp;#x200B;

**Silco - The Heart of Zaun**

Silco is a thoughtful slippery AD melee scaling support who specializes in singling out targets and empowering his most loyal of ally. Silco has a weak early game, but if he's allowed to stay even he can easily take over the entire game.

HP - 2/5 base | 3/5 scaling \]\[ Regen -4/5 | 3/5 scaling

Armor - 3/5 base | 3/5 scaling

MR  - 4/5 base | 3/5 scaling

Mana 4/5 base | 2/5 scaling \]\[ regen - 2/5 | 4/5

AD 3/5 base | 4/5 scaling

AS 2/5 base | 5/5 scaling

MS - 340

&amp;#x200B;

**Passive - Shimmer**

Upon 3 basic attacks or abilities, Silco fills a syringe with shimmer empowering his basic attack. Using it on a target will have different effects depending on if they're allies or enemies. Allies will gain a stack of shimmer giving them additional attack speed and adaptive damage. Repeated applications will reset and extend the timer of shimmer. Enemies with shimmer will be slowed and lose armor. This bonus scales with Silcos bonus attack damage.

**Q - Desperate Swipe**

Silco attacks in a wide area in front of him dealing physical damage. If silco's passive is active, this move can apply his passive on the first champion hit. If Silco is CC'd this ability can be used or finish casting and will deal double damage and apply shimmer. Damage is reduced for targets hit beyond the first. Low cd (8-5 seconds). (this hits 600 range in front of him).

**W - Hexheart**

Silco activates his artificial heart emits a burst of energy giving silco a shield that scales with attack damage and a short burst of movement speed. After a 4-5 seconds, the shield will explode dealing magic damage and slowing enemies in range. While the shield is active, the first enemy champion that is hit by silco is marked. If this target is attacked by silco or his allies, the shield gains HP. If silco reactivates this ability, he can pass the shield. If the shield is full, that target gains a stack of shimmer. 12 CD -&gt; 9.5 CD.

**E - Backstab (yes I know shacos E is also called backstab.)**

Silco jumps behind the target, stabbing them and kicking them forward dealing physical damage and pushing himself back. That target gains a stack of shimmer. This move can be used on allied minions. (No it isn't a poor man's 1 button insec, okay maybe a little) 15 CD -&gt; 10 CD (400 range)

**R - This Ones For Me**

Silco sticks himself with a massive vial of shimmer growing in size and unleashing a devastating backhand dealing physical damage, knocking enemies back and stunning them. While in this state silco takes heavily reduced damage. After the ability is over, Silco loses all bonus armor and MR. This will hit targets who are kicked forward from backstab.

180 CD - 120 CD

&amp;#x200B;

# Gameplan

Silco wants to take it slow in the early game and pick his spots carefully. His W-E engage is strong, but very risky. When level 6 hits, silco starts to become a force to be reckon with, however with the long cooldown on his ult and the cost of using it, you still need to be careful. Silco specializes in buffing his most loyal ally to a monsterous degree and singling out his enemies. Play back to get stacks of shimmer on diving tanks and bruisers, while peeling with backstab and W. Or even, pick out a single target from a fight and knock their team away with your ult. Silco doesn't mind a 1v1 if he has enough gold, but he works best with a friend.

**Weaknesses / counterplay**

Catching silco alone can be a death sentence for him, so look for picks. But in a competitive environment, it's best to put big pressure on his lane early and use AOE cc to stop him from stacking his W to shields the burst. Catching him with cc when he dives in can get him killed. Be sure to harass him if he tries to stack shimmer in lane.

Solo lane? Not recommended, you can probably pull it off. But his wave clear and early game are too bad to take him anywhere like that.

Jungle? It might be good, but you lose out on his passive and his clear would be dogshit. He has good ganks but his damage would be too low and his clears too slow.

(forgive me for not knowing any champ after veigo)

Syngergies - I basically designed him around his syngery with jinx (not really) but yeah that's intentional. Also consider pairing him with kog'maw or kai'sa. He'll even side with a piltovian like caitlyn who can cover him with her range and capitalize off of his cc. Champions who aren't super mobile or quick and attack fast work well with him. Tanks that can enable his engage (maokai, malphite, ornn) are also quite strong with him as well. He'd also be great with a seraphine who can bounce her ult off of him and the target he uses E on as well as help him peel for the carry.

**Counters him**

Caitlyn's outranges even his Q and never has to engage with him, ezreal can poke him down with Q and doesn't have to worry about his waveclear.  Malzahar can pick him easily with his ult, silence to stop him from doing anything and shrug off his CC. Mordekaiser can take him to the death realm (which also fits in nicely as a metaphor for fucking killing him). Morgana can easily land q when he uses e and stop his cc with black shield. Assassins can keep up with him and burst him down before he can take advantage of his passive or w.

**He counters**

Low mobility mages champs and especially Anivia. While she has the cc to stop him she needs to be on her toes and he singles her out stopping any teammates from saving her. Bruisers like darius are easily peeled off and shredded by shimmer against most defensive silco players. Whereas tanks fare no better if the game gets late enough, engaging tanks can get more than what they bargained for when he uses E to push them in and ult to keep the enemy team out.

leagueoflegends,2022,1,"Hello League Community!  


This is something I've been working on this for the last month and a half or so, and I'm super excited to announce it today on the first day of 2022!

# League of Charity

This is charity group with a simple premise. I have volunteer coaches who are willing to give their time to help with this project. Anyone can request coaching, and instead of paying the coach, you donate to our fund that will go to charity. We have both League of Legends and TFT coaching. Feel free to join the server here: https://discord.gg/yrVte25n

# What charities does the money go to?

Right now, I'm only affiliated with LiNK, but the plan is to branch out to other charity orgs as the server grows. I'm still waiting to see how big of a thing this can become so that I understand the scale of this before I get too many other organizations involved. LiNK is a human rights group based in California that helps North Korean refugees adjust to life in the developed world.

# Can I be a coach?

Sure! I only have 6 right now, and I desperately need more people especially for top and jungle if I want this project to grow. The qualifications are simple: 1. Be passionate and excited about the cause. 2. Hit diamond in the game (tft or league) that you'd like to coach (it's recommended that you maintain diamond actively, but not required)  


If you're a coach, you're welcome to stream the coaching sessions if you're looking for some content for your growing youtube/twitch channel as well ;) just make sure you get the student's permission first.  


If you'd like to be a coach, message me a couple of sentences on why you'd like to be a coach. My discord is wawi#2599.

# I like the idea but I don't really want to pay for coaching

On one hand, I get it, but on the other hand this is....sorta free for some people? I think most adults have a budget set aside for charity each year, so in a way, this is money that you'd be spending anyways, you can just get some coaching on this dumb game that you're addicted to and spend too much time on in the meantime. :P",2022-01-01 23:53:49

leagueoflegends,2022,1,"I see lots of complaints about how the game is unbalanced and that it needs to change, but I rarely see any real suggestions for balancing. People always say ""200 years"" but don't say anything about what needs to change. Personally I don't even know where to start with balancing. Probably with items, but riot seems to like where their items are at(?) Lethal tempo definitely needs toned down. At least in the early game. 

But when it comes to champions I feel like it's harder to change just numbers. If you take away base stats it makes the nerfed champion objectively worse than one with higher stats. It's a rocky road. In my opinion I think making a champ deal less damage or have less resistance isn't the way to do it, but at the same time it's hard to change anything else without changing a Champs identity.

While you can stop mid dash with abilities, there's still a considerable number of unstoppable dashes and blinks which make getting into the backline easy.

To date the only characters with actual hard anti-mobility are Poppy and Cass. When are we going to get another champion with the ability to actually stop something like blinks?

Maybe it's because champions like that don't allow for flashy plays, and Poppy, when played well, doesn't let Lee Sin have the opportunity to make those spicy dash flash kick combos.

Today I returned to it and was thinking, why not create a Cardgame based on games i like to play that have a rivality ?

My main ideas for now:

* The cards will use MTG card model.
* The gameplay will be based on MTG, Gwent, Artifact (Dota2 TCG that Valve arruined because of the awful monetization model) and will try to use LoR (played it a little but didn't got used to).
* Decks will be or Dota 2 or LoL (this probably will change as mixing Heroes and Champions will be funny).
* Heroes/Champios card will have 2 abilities based on in game abilities (I maybe add the other abilities as ""Magic"" cards).
* Obviously Cards that are items that will be equiped on Heroes/Champions.
* The board will be based in Gwent (The Witcher card game)  and will have 2 lanes (based on Artifact that has 3 ""boards"" that represent the 3 lanes)

What do you think about it ? Feedback will be SOO MUCH appreciated :D.

The study evaluates the relative difficulty and reward for mastery of all the champions in League, based on different winrate stats across ranks, and, more importantly, across number of games played. However, I can’t seem to find any site which hosts the necessary “winrate by games played” data anymore. Champion.gg (the site used in the original study) no longer has this information, and while leagueofgraphs.com does show winrate by games played, it only goes up to 80 games, which is nowhere near as high as I need it to be. The data itself also seems a little wonky, though that might be because it’s so “zoomed in” on the first few games, so to speak. It would also be great if I could have access to this data across different patches, but I believe only Riot and e-sports teams keep those kinds of records.

leagueoflegends,2022,1,"So, I was doing some damage testing for Vel'koz with the practice tool.

My target was a single `dummy` with `3000 Health` and `100 Magic Resist`, and I noticed that when using `Shadowflame`, the damage I dealt was not matching what I had calculated earlier (by hand) - for all other items the hand calculation matched the practice tool.

I was wondering if I'm doing something wrong, or if there is a bug or something...

Shadowflame's passive goes as: Damage to champions benefits from 10 to 20 additional Magic Penetration based on their current Health... The wiki clarifies that you get the minimum Magic Penetration (10) if the target has 2500 or more Health.

So for my dummy; the damage calculation for one Vel'koz Q at max rank, equipped just with a Shadowflame, and without AP bonuses...

&amp;#x200B;

First I calculate the MR of the dummy, `100 - 10 = 90 MR`

Then I calculate the damage multiplier:

Where:

`dm` \- Is the damage multiplier

`MR` \- Is the Magic Resistance of the dummy, `90`

Which yields a **damage multiplier of \~0.526**

&amp;#x200B;

Then I calculate the Q damage:

Where:

`q` \- Is the Q damage

`AP` \- Is Vel'koz Ability Power, `100` in this case

Resulting in a **raw Q damage of  320**

&amp;#x200B;

Then I just multiply the Q damage with the damage multiplier:

https://preview.redd.it/uyhqddmny7981.png?width=241&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=659232e1729a06478a0f85f49dd9f4f2ac315658

For a **total damage of 168**

The **damage for the same scenario in the practice tool is 164**

leagueoflegends,2022,1,"They're all skillshots, they're immobile, they don't have any kind of shields or iframes or defensive abilities of any kind. They have long cooldowns, they have high mana costs, they have poor waveclear without several items, they take a while to scale into being useful, they don't have access to the very fair and balanced AD itemization. They're very telegraphed, and their combos are very easy to avoid -- even under perfect circumstances.

... why would I play them when I could just play Vex and mash my keyboard and automatically win and be unkillable? Why would I play them when I can just play Lux and mindlessly push E all game and win? Why would I play them when I could pick any AD champ mid, even shit like Pyke works better?

It'd be neat if all my favorite champs weren't gutted because of LC$ so that Riot can make Tencent money (which happens to fund genocide and the oppression of an entire country, but hey).",2022-01-02 09:20:35

leagueoflegends,2022,1,"Haven't slept all night and I just came to a very sad realization of the inequality caster minions face all day everyday. Why are caster minions the most invaluble compared to melee/cannon minions? This is just plain unfair and straight up discriminatory. Like, a caster minion is only worth 14 gold, while a melee minion is worth a whopping 21 G??? That's a 50% difference of actual living value right there, how is this ok? That isn't even the worst part too, because while melee minions are out there with their 50% extra, cannon minions are chilling being worth 60 FUCKING Gs. WHAT? It is quite literally a fucking 328.571% gold difference that has never been seen before, and what's even worse is that the gold for cannon minions INCREASES OVERTIME, all the way to 90 motherfucking Gs.

How? How is this ok? I've been staring at photos of caster minions for the past hour, crying my ass off, because while they suffer from such shame and disappointment from the game, they can't express their frustration as they hope someone out there can speak for them, and that hero they've been waiting for is fucking me. I want justice NOW. I'm done with this stupid fucking game. 14. 14 FUCKING gold. There's no way. THEY WORK JUST AS HARD. THEY DESERVE TO BE WORTH MORE. What if you were a caster minion? What if you were out here, trying your hardest, and then being told that you're worth no more than a snickers bar while your comrades get put on a high pedestal for carrying a sword or riding a fucking cannon? You know how hard it is for them to learn magic? Anyone could become a barbarian like the melee minion animals, or ride a fucking cannon like a chimpanzee, but it takes real skill to learn magic stuff like caster minions. None of this is right.

this is a [follow up](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/rt4pql/which_role_do_you_enjoy_to_play_the_most/) post for more thorough data.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm interested in seeing what the answers here are. Does r/leagueoflegends have a lot of support and mid players? a lack of bot and jungle players? Are those roles just less popular or is there a reason that people don't play them as often?

&amp;#x200B;

Regardless, this will also likely be followed up with another post in 2 days, a google form to try and specific more data about the biggest outlier role (likely to be support).

&amp;#x200B;

I'm expecting to make a rather large form now that I'm seeing that data. It will likely contain a lot of specific questions about each role. I would like to ask things about why you prefer the role, if you think the role is strong, what you like dislike about the role, as well as questions about sheer demographics (likely asking age, gender, rank, ETC). Huge info posts like this are HUGELY helpful to me and other people who enjoy making ""mega posts"" such as my previous \~5k word essays that you can find if you look at my profile.

leagueoflegends,2022,1,"The preset runes are... well, I shouldn't say *useless*, just *""sub-optimal""* for almost all champions, who would rather pick runes with better configurations. It just works out as a ""Better than nothing"" sort of thing if you end up needing to choose a champion you don't have a rune prepared specifically for.

&amp;#x200B;

[Here are the options that is given to everyone... I think? At least for me, it's like this.](https://preview.redd.it/ry28apknaa981.png?width=1003&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1c9a6e5d8ecbd255128cd14ef5babaa17a0e6a12)

However, I was curious to know; who exactly would do very well with these default runes, exactly?I don't have a lot of knowledge when it comes to knowing what a champion does, and I tried looking up a question similar to what I'm asking, but I had no luck finding anything.

It doesn't feel right to almost always ignore the preset options, since I want to at least know which champions I know I can use alongside a preset rune. This is in case I can't pick a champion with a rune prepared due to not working well with the team comp or something.

So, in your opinion; which champions do you think would benefit at least 80% min/maxed efficiency with one of the preset runes compared to a specifically designed rune already prepared for them ?

This is a question, but also an incentive for discussion, which I whole-heartedly encourage to spread around.

I don't like this direction and think it would be much better for the game as a whole if new champs followed the KISS method.

Champs like Akshan Viego and Yone just shouldn't have been made you could remove half their kits and still have functioning champions. 

Toxicity in game isn't on the rise because the player base are animals, toxicity is going up because of stuff like Akshan revive, Yone E and Viego getting resets and being untargetable every time he gets one did they honestly not learn anything from how people feel about Yi getting resets.  These 3 champs make me dodge every time they're on the enemy team because no matter what their win rates are they're toxic and no fun to play against.

However DOTA 2 seems to be the more latest release , so I am also drawn to that quite a bit since it would have better graphics and more improvements.

Overall I just want to try out a MOBA that won't take me weeks to learn , I am willing to put in some hours though.

After another whopping 11 hard loses in a row - and even giving up on my role as a whole - I was forced to leave a game (thinking they would remake) because I somehow didn't realize I was jungle and didn't pick smite... So my losing spree was ended by my team straight up winning 4v5.

Master Yi says “One strike”, implying he only  swings once. However in Alpha Strike we see him in many locations appearing to swing multiple times. Perhaps it is only one swing. 


Consider if Wuju Style allows him to bend space and time, causing him to appear in many places with many swings but ultimately he never has moved. This could be supported by the fact he always returns to his original location..

Wu Kong, another practitioner of Wuju. Has the ability to “Decoy” and dash to you with multiple images of himself. What if this is just our primate warrior appearing twice or more on the same timeline?

Edit - Yi lore also points to him being able to see ghosts of the past. What if these are really just instances of him interacting with his villagers in the past?",2022-01-02 18:16:45

She already has her own shield, and she has a consistent knockback with her Q which would go off ever 4ish seconds by the time she gets fimbulwinter (15 ability haste from fimbulwinter plus 20 from either trinity force or divine sunderer - those alone drop Q's cooldown to 4.4 seconds).

I'm considering having the secondary runes be Resolve - with Shield Bash &amp; Revitalize, making her very shield tanky with Shield Bash proccing every 3ish seconds helping to keep damage up. Especially since Shield Bash would help a bit with early with jungle clear due to her passive.

Or would this just take way too long to get online? (I feel like I'm always trying to put the mana tear gear into builds only to remember how long they take to come online.)

I really like the idea of fimbulwinter, but it feels like it doesn't work great on many champs.

leagueoflegends,2022,1,"So I recently got Akshan in an aram and was surprised at how amazingly fun it was to swing around Tarzan style so I decided to step into SR(rare these days) and practice Akshan.  It was then I realized that Akshan is the ultimate singed hunter.

Now, I get it, ""dont chase the Singed"" is classic league memes and usually good advice, but hear me out for a second because I think its safe to say everyone hates the dirty juice man as much as I do and would like to hear why Akshan is so good at sniffin shim. 

So first we've got his grappling hook which is fantastic for catching up to (and even getting in front of) enemies, but it will also often swing you OUT of the dirty Man's poisons.   


Second we have the Bangarang which is an on demand low CD ability that on both spit and swallow grants 40% movespeed so you can maintain auto distance.   


Now lets assume for a moment this known drug user is in fact on drugs and faster than you. Well its simple, if he's much faster than you what I noticed ends up happening is he will cancel your second auto by out-ranging you and that will automatically grant you move-speed as though you had purposefully cancelled it(take that pro players I can auto cancel too). But wait there's more! These are the smaller and more refined reasons why Akshan fits so smoothly into singed's glove. We're talking shields from his passive, the fact that a core item is wits end making singed unable to kill you by encircling you with the fart gas. And a long range execute for that 20% health singed just before he disappears into a shrub.

  
And last, but not least, in those moments when both you and the singed believe he escaped we have the W to help sniff out that filthy shim slinger and send him to the Viego realm.

So now its your turn, who's your go to gas trespasser?

Edit: this is all experience while the singeds were proxying behind tier 1 turret.

Edit 2: it's truly impressive to see half the replies be ""lol yeah right akshan can't beat singed"" and the other half ""wow so ur saying ranged top layers are OP BS? YEAH I KNOW IDIOT""

Oh looks like the enemy jungle karthus got a couple of kills and is strong too, should be fine still right? Then he ults and i lose 60% of my total hp, and his 1s cd Qs are doing about 50% of my hp bar, karthus has sorcerer void staff and shadowflame.

So yeah i effectively have 0 mr, so let me fix this by slowing down my build and snowball to get a negatron cloak! Now after slowing my build by almost 1000 gold i go from having 0 mr to having... 7 mr! I now quickly remember why i have been avoiding adc.

How is this in any world acceptable? Am i supposed to just go full tank as ad carries to not instantly die to anybody that gets 1~2 mpen items (which every single mage is building)? Oh right i guess im just supposed to go and and play a mage that can build shit like crown and hourglass, the only way for a squishy class to actually live in current league.

And dont you worry, magic damage is too weak and MR is too overpowered, so we are going to nerf wits end and shieldbow and do absolutely nothing about the current state of mpen, current damage levels in the game being this high is just not a fun experience and neither is having no counterplay (in fact, if you build MR you're basically throwing gold into a dumpster, you're helping the mage basically).",2022-01-02 21:36:06

In fact on [U.GG](https://u.gg/)  she has the worst win rate out of all support, only higher than the  ""off meta"" picks which isn't the best of titles to get. Now it could be  brushed off to inexperience, but the low win rates are the same across  all of the ranks. And people who had the best win rates on her, do not  even main her and have better win rates on other champions.

Another  thing I've noticed is the feeling of weakness while playing her. She  has so much in her kit, that some may call her overloaded. And yet she  never appears or have ever appeared to be called 200 years or so  compared to Sylas or Akshan (Other champions with nearly perfect kits).  Every time I see enemy pick her, I am always worried of losing to her  and yet I am able to pick almost any support (besides enchanters)  champion and win against her (primarly Nautilus, Veigar, Lux, since  those are some of my other mains). I thought it could be attributed to  the fact that she ain't a tank support, which for the most time where  the meta across almost all season. Yet it can't be? Her W although with  all it's downsides appears to be similar to Morgana, another stable  pick. And although lacking the ""no cc shield"", she has plenty of other  abilities to compliment for that.

leagueoflegends,2022,1,"After reading the short story ""Dead of Winter"" featuring Sejuani and Olaf, I have come to the realization that Olaf is an Absolute Giant of a Unit:

&gt; Shedding blood alongside Olaf the Berserker for many years had taught Sejuani that he was none of those things. Even on foot, he was easily the **biggest Freljordian she had ever seen**, the **equal of the mounted Sejuani and Urkath in height.** Some said **Olaf’s mother must have lain with a troll to grow so big**, but they never said it to his face. 

How large is Olaf? Like how immense is he actually? He is the biggest Freljordian Sej has ever seen and others compare him to the size of a troll, thus his height must be somewhere in between Braum (2.26m) and Trundle (ca. 5m). Sweet mother of Aurelion Sol! We're talking a behemoth of a man. He is comparable in height to mounted Sej. Sejuani is probably around 1.7-1.8m and Bristle may as well be 2m, that could mean Olaf is around 3m! 3m tall! He would look down on Braum as he was a child.

leagueoflegends,2022,1,"Hear me out here at least before I get down voted. Despite League of Legends' massive world and lores, very few characters have actually seen a lot of development. Thankfully, things are beginning to change with things like Arcane and Ruined King though.

Anyways, I would like to propose a thought experiment. Suppose you were caught in war, or at least the real prospect of it. There would be all sorts of emotions to be felt--trauma, fear, morbid satisfaction. There's a lot of room for character development at least. Even so, there's a surprising lack of character depth considering. Most champions have a personality and lore that very much go together as a trope. Garen is the walking embodiment of justice with a sword. Draven just likes himself and killing people. 

Seraphine on the other hand? We see the complex feelings she has dealing with popularity, pressure, depression, growing a career, all that. She's one of the most relatable characters in the cast, at least a lot more than everything known about Teemo, Azir, Darius, and Vayne put together. 

My question is why don't we see this with more champions who have a lot more to work with? I argue that it isn't that Seraphine isn't the pinacle of champion development, but that many other champions still fall below the minimum they need to stand beyond single tropes.

And no, Seraphine is only my number 2 highest mastery",2022-01-02 23:27:37

leagueoflegends,2022,1,"i think we're overdue 

with graves, quinn, vayne, akshan, corki all being viable in at least 1 solo lane and mordekaiser being reworked (terribly) into a toplane only champion and the garen-yuumi strat of season 8 long dead, we now lack *100%* of all botlane-viable juggernauts 

i think the potential design here could be very interesting and since bot lane is already welcoming to mages in the farming carry role, adding a new juggernaut to carry from bot lane would be a very cool niche to fill in for the team. or we could just buff one into duo lane viability. that might work, too.

leagueoflegends,2022,1,"Hey everyone, this is my first Reddit post. I've been playing League for many years now on and off. I'm pretty casual so I'm hard stuck in Bronze, haha. I do enjoy watching high level play so I follow the esports scene even when I'm not actively playing.

I don't have many friends to share my story with, so I would like to share it with the League community. I was born with an extremely rare genetic disorder called nemaline rod myopathy (approximately 1:50,000 odds) which basically means I walk with a limp and I have difficulties doing everyday things due to my muscle weakness. I've been through severe depression (suicidal) because of it and other circumstances in my life. I've always been overweight, and at one point even hitting 210 lbs (I'm 5'8"").

In 2020 I told myself enough was enough. I was around 175-180lbs at that point and rapidly gaining due to the pandemic causing everyone to stay at home. However, I started eating healthier and pushed myself to exercise. Through persistence, hard work, and consistency, I dropped roughly 50lbs in about a year and I have been maintaining it since (very difficult!).

Anyway, I picked up nunchaku training (Youtube tutorials ftw) as part of my workout routine and I've been training almost every day for a year and 3 months now. Here's a short video I made today. I wasn't going for the 'Lee Sin' look but people might think that due to the red blindfold, haha. It has been a very, VERY, difficult journey getting to today, but it has all been worth it.

leagueoflegends,2022,1,"Link: [https://lolcomps.gg](https://lolcomps.gg)

Hello all! I finally launched my website that I have been slowly creating for over a year now. The site is all about having fun with team compositions! The site features a team comp roller, where you can roll three different types of team comps - Themed, Random, and Pro.  


**Overview**

Pro comps are team comps taken from past professional LoL games. As of right now, all Worlds games (Quarterfinals and higher) are added to the site. These comps are for those who like to take the game a little more seriously, and could be a great drafting resource for Clash games!

Themed comps are hand crafted comps where the champions all have something in common. This could mean the champions are all from the same region (e.g. Zaun) or have some defining characteristic that they are share (e.g. Hook ability). These are fun comps to mess around with, even though some of them might be a *little* troll in order to make the theme work...

Random comps are just that - 5 fully random champions. This is the ultimate mental and physical challenge. Can your jungler keep it together trying to clear camps as jungle Yuumi? Only one way to find out!

Additionally, each team comp can come with a random modifier! The modifier can either be a rune or summoner spell that everyone must take, or an item everyone must build.

If you don't have enough people for a full team to run a comp, I created a Discord server that can be found on the website. I hope to make a community there for people who want to just goof off, play some wacky League games and have a fun time!  

&amp;#x200B;

I hope you have fun using the site and if you have any questions/comments/concerns feel free to DM me or join the Discord server that has a link provided on the website. I am a one man band, and this is my first ever website, so please be patient with me as I sort out any kinks that may arise! 

Thanks for taking the time to read this and check out the site, it means a lot to me!

leagueoflegends,2022,1,"Started playing back in season 3. Never grinded ranked that much, just made a quick climb to gold for the free skin and stopped playing. I always enjoyed playing with a group of friends, and having fun that way, playing what I wanted to, whether it was meta or not.

 Metas being a big aspect of the game: constantly changing with patches and tuning. I was there for a pretty decent chunk of it, and even watching the ancient metas before I started playing myself. The oppressive Tank meta, the various assassin metas that phased in and out, the overbearing mage periods, and just about everything else. I'm not that different from most people, things like getting mad at new changes, because for most idiots like me, change=bad. But also, things like getting hyped for new reworks and other cool RIOT  creations, like Arcane. I think as a whole, RIOT does a pretty good job at balancing the game and keeping it in a decent state. Not always, but most of the time.

But for the past few months of playing casually, the game has stopped being fun at all. New champions rolling the old ones, regardless of if they do good or bad in game. And in particular, the COMPLETE over abundance of healing for everyone and their mother, has actually damaged the game incredibly badly. Grievous wounds going from a situational buy, to a MUST HAVE every game is absurd. It kills the notion of item diversity, when every game often feels like and arms race of healing items, often regardless of class. The Yone feeding lane, and  building a shield bow and deaths dance makes him as tanky as a tank, while killing everyone. The Jax top, with a Divine Sunderer and a Spirit Visage making him indestructible. The Soraka healing 1200 Hp to someone in 3 seconds, none of these things are fun to deal with. 

Those reasons above have built up over the past few months, to someone who plays a variety of roles casually, have killed the game for me. I can only imagine what people grinding ranked must feel on the daily.

I seriously think EVERY PIECE of healing in the game needs to be cut in half, then I would consider playing again. 

I know I'm just one person with a half baked take on one of the biggest games in the world, but I have played for 9 years. I think that adds just a little bit of merit to how I feel the state of the game is. Ive stuck through lots of shitty metas, but I feel the one we are in is the worst one to date.

Thanks for reading, hyped for season 2 of Arcane.",2022-01-03 01:19:41

leagueoflegends,2022,1,"While malding over certain champions being too frustrating to play against I decided to look up if Riot had adressed adding more than 10 bans ([ASK RIOT: I WANT MORE BANS](https://www.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/news/dev/ask-riot-i-want-more-bans/)). 

Besides the obvious - that your champ might get banned, I really think they should consider why champs have high ban rates: 1) It's broken af, 2)It's annoying enough to not want to deal with it.

From this point on it seems like it would be easy for them to understand why people ban the champion so much and maybe do something about: 1) the champ itself (kit, numbers, etc.) 2) runes/items.

People will argue that hating on the new champs is just wanting the game to be booring and statcheck-y, but on the other hand. Who in their right mind would ever want to play against Irelia, Yone, Qiyana, Akshan? Whenever I look at the 15 champs released since 2019, pretty much half of them i'd rather see banned every game because \*insert malding here\*

I know the bottom line is they probably will never increase the bans because most of their cash-grab nightmare champs would be perma banned. But just saying something as asinine as: ""Many of our positions and champion classes could be completely banned out with more bans."" without seemingly considering why that might happen is just surprising.

Corki is a short ranged adc that got evicted to mid who spams rocket skillshots as his main source of damage on a charge system although his aa's still do damage

Chogath has short range and no mobility. Every other warden has some way of getting close. He alao has no sustain outside of laning phase. 

Tryndamere is a smirmisher who has no teamfight capabilites what so ever. That's why he splitpushes. After he's done with that, he's a shit version of yi.

leagueoflegends,2022,1,"Ghost poro is probably the most unpopular rune in the whole game, which is weird because I don't think it's even that bad, I feel like people just don't know what it does/can't be bothered exploring it. 

It's basically the same thing as zombie ward except you get stacks when your wards expire, rather than when you clear wards. The stacks give the same amount of stats, and the vision is the same. So basically to decide between the two, you should ask yourself, what will happen more, my wards expiring without being cleared, or me clearing wards? 

I'm not sure the answer to this question, as I don't know of any stats that track how many of your wards live a full life, but I don't think it's farfetched to say that there are a significant number of games where ghost poro would be a better choice than zombie ward, making its low pick rate a bit baffling. In high elo and pro play, it's well known that people buy more control wards and wards are cleared more often. So zombie ward kinda sounds like the better choice, but for the rest of soloq I don't understand why people don't take this ward more often, as wards often stay alive for their whole life due to less emphasis on vision control.",2022-01-03 07:10:00

I am a really try-hard player when it comes to competitive games and even tho I am Silver right now I try my best.

leagueoflegends,2022,1,"So I finally came across a Sion with Chemtech Soul in my game today, and let me tell you, this is NOT fun. 

Sion Passive + Chemtech Soul + Guardian Angel is the most frustrating thing I've played against in months of playing. They go 1/10, but have Hullbreaker/Spirit Visage to mitigate damage from my entire team long enough that they can take turrets AND inhibitors while they're busy not dying, and then also dying.   
I don't plan on continuing to play long enough to see this in action with champs like Zilean or Akshan, because if I do I will probably just quit right then and there.   
I've played this game for years, but changes like this really make me wonder if Riot is still working on the same game or they've fully deviated into what they consider to be ""game-changing mechanics"" and ""fun, versatile gameplay"". 

Open to comments and discourse, really want to know how other people have fared with these changes.

leagueoflegends,2022,1,"Do we honestly want low/no skill champions to have a winning record in high elo.  This is on top of being insanely broken and having the highest ban rate of any champ in low elo. Master Yi has the highest ban rate in the entire game in silver along with a 52% wr and 14% pick rate despite how often he's banned.  The tired argument of just CC him is a bad one since hard CC counters any squishy carry.  I really think we should be promoting higher skill champs in high elo.  Yi should be toned down and ideally reworked since he ruins games for newer players.

Tryndamere is now a flex pick and being played both top and mid in high elo if Lethal Tempo is nerfed like it should be maybe the Tryndamere problem takes care of itself but if not he also needs toned down.  His ban rate and play rate have both spiked recently.  And he's yet another example of a low skill champ who just runs people down.  My suggestion is making it so tower shots can kill him through his ult he'll still be an unkillable menace in team fights and side lanes if he creates a freeze but he won't be tower diving people for free anymore.

leagueoflegends,2022,1,"Who really builds stridebreaker anymore , after the dash removal almost no ever builds the items. So my question is what purpose does the item have now other than slow someone and stick to them. Though this might seem good the truth is if a mage or adc get close enough to the active to being with they are probably dead as most bruisers already have slows in their kits, so it feels redundant. Also the current bruiser itemization is very polarising it depends on weather you can proc spell blade easily. If yes, you build devine sunderer and if no you build goredrinker. As a result no one ever builds stridebreaker or trinity force. I would say mage and adc mythucs are very versatile atm, if you want damage you build ludens and kraken, if you wanna build safe you go crown or shield bow then u have items like liandrys for hp burn and galeforce for more mobility and everfrost even gives you slow/root.

leagueoflegends,2022,1,"I’ve thought about this question a fair bit, because I’m a huge fan of Targon, and where there’s Targon the antagonist is either gonna be the void, darkin, a demon or other targonians. And I really like cosmic horror. 

With the next cinematic leaked being called ‘the call’ I think it might be showing Jax’s call to arms. So which champs do you think will respond to his call?

Some potential requirements:

1) No heavy political ties or duty (think J4, Ashe, swain). If fighting the void requires a champion to abandon their people, they probably won’t. 

2) They poses exceptional skill in their field

3) They are at least vaguely good aligned

4) They are not a higher power, or do not defer to higher powers (like Taric and Karma) - the reason for this is that many higher powers would try and combat the void themselves without putting their faith in a ragtag crew of mortals

So of course we have Pantheon. He’s the perfect fit, being a superhuman who’s perfected the spear. I reckon with his spear and shield he could even beat Jax due to superhuman strength and speed (but would lose with any other weapon. Pantheon is made to join the void crew. 

Then there’s Yi. Master of wuju, not as good with the blade as fiora but up there, and his sword spirit wouldn’t object to killing voidlings, so he could slice and dice them all. 

I think they should have a mage, but I don’t know who. Lux would be ideal, but she’s untrained and busy with demacia’s problems. Ryze is still protecting the runes, syndra hates everyone. Veigar doesn’t fit. IDK for this one.  

Edit: hmmmm. Which master mage is anti void I wonder? I’m stupid. Ofc Zilean is in. 

Edit #2: Ofc Kassadin and Kai’sa would help out. Also poppy would be a great choice. Maybe the hero is one of the anti void squad. Pantheon seems pretty heroic.

leagueoflegends,2022,1,"Kai'Sa is commonly criticized for her design, but I find it very unwarranted. It seems like people just don't get how her design communicates her story.

&amp;#x200B;

For example, people say that Kai'Sa should have scars or other visible battle-damage. But why would Kai'Sa have scars? Protecting her from harm is one of the things her Void symbiote does.

Besides that, the lack of scars demonstrates her competency. Yes, Kai'Sa fights Void monsters. She's been doing it for a long time. She's gotten ***good*** at it. Kai'Sa fights to protect humanity from the Void, and we know by looking at her that she can handle the job. If she had scars, we wouldn't be able to have faith in her. It's the same reason that most superheroes don't have scars.

&amp;#x200B;

I really don't understand this point. Miss Fortune is a pirate. Shouldn't she have scars? Fiora's entire family legacy is centered around fencing: the sport of trying to poke your opponent with a saber. Shouldn't she have scars?

And it applies to the male Champions, too: Xin Zhao looks remarkably clean for a gladiator-turned-soldier. Lucian is a Sentinel who regularly faces the horrors created by the Harrowing.

I'd say most Champions *should* have scars, but only a relatively-small number of them actually do.

So why does it stand out for Kai'Sa? Especially when, like I said, she has a reason to ***not*** have scars because of her Void symbiote.

&amp;#x200B;

People criticize Kai'Sa's hair. Her hair is an indicator of her *health*. Healthy people have healthy hair. Unhealthy people have weak, brittle hair. This indicates that she's doing well in her circumstances.

&amp;#x200B;

People want Kai'Sa to be more ""monstrous"", when the entire point of her character is how she managed to hold onto her humanity, ***despite*** the harshness of her circumstances. She isn't some wild animal fighting against the Void. She's tactical, swift, and efficient about it.

And isn't it more impressive that she *hasn't* become feral? That she holds onto her humanity despite having a Void symbiote grafted onto herself and facing otherworldly horrors? That she can operate with a goal in mind beyond simply surviving: protecting the world from the Void?

Besides, we have already have the ""feral apex predator"" design covered in League: Rengar, and to an extent, Nidalee. We don't need even more overlap in that design space.

&amp;#x200B;

And there's even a reason for her plunging neckline, too:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knVlCogF2Yc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knVlCogF2Yc)

Kai'Sa would be susceptible to overheating when exerting herself if she didn't have enough surface area exposed to cool down.

But beyond that, they want to emphasize that Kai'Sa is a *human* who fights against the Void (with a Void symbiote).

From a design-perspective, they felt her look with the helmet up didn't communicate ""Human with a Void symbiote"" to the player very well. I'm thinking it seemed more like ""Human-shaped Kha'Zix"". So, they let the player see her hair, face, and enough skin to stand out against her dark-purple Void symbiote. This creates contrast and makes the fact that she is a human more apparent.

&amp;#x200B;

Like I said, I feel like people miss how Kai'Sa's design communicates her story and unfairly criticizes it.",2022-01-03 13:01:05

As I hate myself, I´ve been playing ADC exclusively since season 3. I´m far from beeing a good player (gold 3 atm.), but as I only have a little time to play besides work I´m okay with that. I´d like to improve, and I feel like it could help me a lot!

Is there any entertaining youtuber/streamer who is an ADC main and comments his/her gamplay the way I described? I prefer german or english people :D I cant help it but I am unable to find an (preferably higher-elo) ADC main who is streaming.  


Thanks for any hints :)

leagueoflegends,2022,1,"Recently, the release of Arcane and the promise of an MMORPG has got a lot of people excited again for the stories from the continent of Valorant in Runeterra. Here are some changes and additions that I thought would fit snuggly, and strengthen the lore.

I few years ago, summoners were erased and The League Of Legends lost its' reason for being. There is a better way.

  Summoners should be in the game lore for a few reasons and I have a way that would make it work. They should be there not for a champions lore to be built around, but to help support some. For example Sona hearing voices and brands iconic line- ""do you fear me summoner?"" Also the summoner story is unique and supports the formation and idea that The league of legends can exist.

The way this can still work is simple. Summoners can the summon a copy of the power, form and spirit of beings, without the original being aware or having their life affected. Summoners do this for either sport or political disputes. The people of Valorant are unaware of the institute of wars existence (for now).

Riot games are also working on an mmorpg. This story line could fit perfectly for a new character created and dropped into the world of Runeterra. 

Although the player will get involved in the real stories of runeterra, they are also on a mission from the summoners that have recently arrived there to seek out, people, monsters, beings and other powers that are strong enough to be used as champions, items and bosses (baron) to be used in 'The League of Legends'. This would be a fantastic backstory and explanation for your character suddenly being  present in the world with no family, knowledge or prior existence of the place.

The Bilgewater Black Market will be powered by Riot own Crypto currency: the Yasuocoin coded $YAS.

Riot server all over the world will participate in mining the $YAS. We estimate 40% of Riot server computing power will be needed, to accommodate we will limit the amount of Iron and Bronze ranked game that can be launched. It's a win for everyone.

We will retire Hextech crafting and convert all of your current skins in NFT for the Bilgewater Black Market with the price in $YAS calculated with the tier of the skin, method of acquisition and seniority. New investor will be able to acquire some of the rarest skins like Pax Sivir or Silver Kayle, we see no way how this could lead to toxic behavior or scam.

Skins are only the beginning. We plan to add icon, ranked border and honor progression level. For those who ask what are the advantages of using Crypto currency instead of just storing the items on your account and adding trading option, this is a great question.",2022-01-03 14:43:30

A lot of people also agree that Yone's kit has too much strength, too many numbers making him overtuned. So that raises the question: What champ do you dislike more to play against in toplane, Yone or Vayne? Same skill level, not a countermatchup to whatever champ you play.

leagueoflegends,2022,1,"Jungle is by far the most impactful role in the game, to the point that in many high elo games the laners spend most of the time not trying to break their lane opponent but help their jungler so he can have more presence around the map to make plays. In low elo games, the better jungler will typically just win the game unless there is a substantial skill gap in laners (which in fairness happens a lot in low elo) but that doesn’t change the fact that from minute one having the better jungler is a win condition.

However, it’s also very hard to nerf jungle, because if you lessen their ganking potential then they have far less ways to impact the map and express their own skill, but if you weaken their farming potential then ganking junglers become god (fuck you 2021 hecarim) and theres even more pressure for the jungler to get his laners ahead, which leads to more toxicity among other issues.

leagueoflegends,2022,1,"This champ's E has been blatantly broken since release. The lines it generates often make no sense and don't really limit the Talon whatsoever. Additionally, the cooldown per terrain is nonexistent. By the time he's back in x side of the map, all the limits are LONG GONE. 

---

Add a stack system to Talon similar to Gangplank's Barrels or Azir's Soldiers. I'm tired of watching Talon hop across the map with no repercussions. 

In combat? jump over the next 7 pieces of terrain in 15 seconds.

Ganking? Evade every ward on earth by jumping through vision no one every covers whenever you feel like it. 

Want to clear camps? Jump over every inch of terrain completely ignoring one of the most vital parts of Jungle balance, movement speed. 

It's not an ""identity"", it's just annoying.

There needs to be actual repercussions for Talon e'ing over everything. Currently they don't exist unless hyper specific criteria are met.

---

**Edit 1**: To everyone saying ""iT's 160 sEcONds aT rANk 1!!!"" 

Remind me again how we as his opponents see this cooldown? 

Remind me again with how *wildly* consistent the borders of his e's are so we can even guess where he can and cannot e next on a single piece of terrain? 

Remind me again which strategy involves only clearing 25% of the jungle and just sitting their until the camps respawn again ad nauseam (so the cooldown would even vagally matter).

You guys act like anyone in the game has any idea which walls are off limits for him; or even worse, which PARTS of the walls are off limit. His enemies have NO idea. They don't know if he e'd to clear jungle. They don't know if he took a weird route without at least 1 random ward. Nobody knows but him. So forgive me if I come off as harsh, but you're living in a fairytale. 

If Talon was instead limited by stacks, you know he has AT MOST ~2 stacks left when he jumps over a wall. The guess work is done. Hell, the cooldown could even be lower than 160 seconds per stack. God forbid, anyone, anywhere, had any idea what Talon's e is capable of, but him. 

The gameplay loop isn't healthy for a Jungler, and IMO even a Mid laner. The sooner you Talon white knights realize this, the soon we can work TOGETHER to improve his standings, for EVERYONE.",2022-01-03 16:57:19

Like wouldn't it be enough if it was nerfed only for melee champs, and Vayne got her own nerf? Cause this way they messed with Aphelios, koq'max, Kalista, Akshan, Ashe and so on. 

Now I don't want to whine here so i'm mainly interested in your opinions: Do you think ADC-s need a rework? If they do, than what could help them?

It's possible I'm completely wrong, and I miss some points, but here is how i see it:

Literally every class can carry atm: Tanks have enough dmg in the mid game, Assassins stomp everybody with one kill lead, bruisers have the dmg of an adc, but much better survivability. While ADC-s are very squishy, and their power spikes are pretty late into the game.

leagueoflegends,2022,1,"It probably happened to many of us. Enemy Bard uses his portal, you knock him up while he is using it (and hitting such abilities against people in portal is not easy at all in most cases), he gets knocked out.

What happens next? He just presses right mouse button on it again and he is out. You landing that ability meant nothing.

If Yuumi gets CC'd there is a 5 second cooldown before she can attempt to attach to someone again. It's a reasonable mechanic which is there to prevent her from being way too forgiving, and rewards you for hitting her when she jumps out to proc passive or just gets caught somewhere say trying to ward.

Almost every single dash can be interrupted if you time your knockup well, it will do nothing and go on a full cooldown - you are rewarded for skill expression.

I do not see why Bard should be an exception considering how strong his portals are. Just like with other dashes, stuns might not interrupt it, but various knockups should for sure prevent people from being able to use a portal again for a couple of seconds.

To clarify, no, I did not just lose a game to Bard nor played against him recently, it's just a thing that was bothering me for a long time and him being knocked out of a portal and just re-entering it happened on a stream I was watching.

I absolutely do not mind if he will get some minor buffs to compensate for this small nerf because it will make dealing with him a lot more interactive and provide a skillful way to deal with his portal.",2022-01-03 17:28:20

leagueoflegends,2022,1,"Hello everyone I am here to request your opinion on reducing the amount of smurf accounts dramatically. 

I myself posess many smurfs (something like 8) and I understand why someone would want one. 

Some want to try and reach their rank again to prove they arent boosted. Some as a test account. Some play a different role to challenger per account and thats understandable (have a nice day). 

However, most people do not need a smurf account or maybe one at most. Honestly I dont even know why I have so many accounts and now they are all inactive except for one. 

So here is my question: What do you guys think about limiting the amount of accounts per IP. 

So say Riot decides anyone may have two accounts, one main and one smurf, but they literally cannot access another account beyond that per device. 

Imo this ould solve some of the major issues league has like smurfs ruining a bunch of low elo games and toxicity, because now you cant just get a new account after being toxic and permabanned. 

For content creators who might need multiple accounts like Tyler1 with his ""reaching challenger in every role"" exceptions could be added or Riot themselves gives them another account that can be accessed form any IP. 

This would also make boosting a lot harder since the boosting services would need a new IP everytime they want to boost an account. 

I didnt really spend a whole lot of time refining this thought so there are probably a bunch of issues with it, but I am sure all of you will tell me exactly why its a good or bad idea, just like in my games ;)

Have a nice day.",2022-01-03 19:31:26

[**SPELLBLADE**](https://leagueoflegends.fandom.com/wiki/Named_item_effect#Spellblade)**:** After using an [ability](https://leagueoflegends.fandom.com/wiki/Champion_ability), your next basic attack within 10 seconds deals (📷 12% / 📷 9%) of target's **maximum** health as **bonus** physical damage [on-hit](https://leagueoflegends.fandom.com/wiki/On-hit) (from LoL wiki)

This item's passive should do bonus physical damage. Yet somehow, when I have to suffer watching deathscreen after accidentally meeting Camille, in death recap, it always shows tons of true dmg dealt by items. As far as I am aware, there are no items dealing true damage.

So my question is: Where does this balanced \~1k true dmg dealt by items come from? And if from Divine, how is that interaction in the game for so long? Feels like a massive bug.

leagueoflegends,2022,1,"So, i've been thinking recently. I've played League of Legends on and off since its release. Its a game I have sunken roughly over the years at minimum 5000 hours. What stops me playing?

The toxicity ultimately, or the frustration that comes with trolls. Here is some of the reasons:

""I afk as my champ banned""

""Surrender or I Afk""

\*purpose feeding to encourage surrender / quick loss\*

Or just constant flaming other players even though they make the same mistakes.

&amp;#x200B;

I have many friends who really enjoy the game but just wont play it any longer due to the trolls and toxicity from other players, yes.. we could make a 5v5 team. But as you know its not often 5 players can all be on at the same time to play.

&amp;#x200B;

What I think would help the community is to now move away from its free to play model and put an initial price tag on the game similar to small indie titles around £15 / $20 per account. This can allow you the choice to pick a handful of starter champions or maybe a choice of 3 skins? 

&amp;#x200B;

This in my opinion will discourage toxic behaviour or people purposely ruining peoples ranked games because they don't care and someone did or said something that they didn't like. I cant name any other game that allows 1 person to potentially ruin 40 minutes for 9 players by trolling.

&amp;#x200B;

Would like to know the general feel for this?",2022-01-03 23:07:29

Essentially, I used the previous two polls to figure out the best questions to ask in this poll.

For example, a few questions in this poll have to do specifically with how much role mains enjoy their role, which could possibly explain why support is such an enjoyable role despite being ranked third in terms of overall popularity; Support players may just really enjoy what they do. It will also let me ask questions that specifically have to do with what people like and dislike about certain roles.

leagueoflegends,2022,1,"**Significant Bugs (newer)**

(1) **Yorick's R cooldown will reset if you re-cast R just before Yorick dies**

Forgot to include this one initially but you can actually reset his ultimate's cooldown entirely if you re-cast your R shortly before you're about to die. [It's difficult to time versus random damage, but if you're about to die from a followable projectile then it's much easier to do.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWjcD8hMlEU) It also can cause not only your R to refresh but your maiden to stay alive too so you can effectively have two maiden's as soon as you respawn!

(2) **Chemtech Rift doesn't put pets invisible**

Yorick's Mist Walkers and Maiden of the Mist do not go invisible when inside the gas from the Chemtech Rift. Since his pets always walk behind him, this means you can literally see where Yorick is at all times because his pets will reveal his location.

(3) **Yorick's Mourning Mist (E) draws minion aggro**

Yorick's E will immediately draw minion aggro onto Yorick if at least one mist walker jumps to the target champion. This is due to the 40% bonus damage dealt on their first 8 attacks causing minion aggro for some reason.

(4) **Yorick's Pets** ***still*** **cannot proc cheap shot, corrupting potion, Ravenous Hydra or other 'spell based' items and runes**

Very straight forward - these runes and items do not work with Yorick's pets. Despite the target being slowed by any means, cheap shot will not activate and the Maiden of the Mist is the only pet in Yorick's arsenal that can proc corrupting potion. On the contrary, other items like liandries do proc?

**Minor Bugs**

(5) **Yorick's pets can block Yorick after he goes through the portals from Hextech Rift**

For some reason if you take the hextech portals and land near the edge of a wall, there is a chance that you'll get stuck inside the Maiden of the Mist and be unable to move and forced to recall unless you can move her via the wolf camp.

(6) **Yorick's pets will sometimes run straight past enemy units and attack a pre-determined target without instruction from Yorick to do so**

This is extremely interesting because there are plenty of examples for when Mist Walkers and the Maiden of the Mist are attacking the WRONG target. Two examples include:

* [When Mist Walkers walk directly past minions and champions to attack the enemy nexus](https://youtu.be/bOpSPHMQUn8?t=17).
* [When the Mist Walkers ignore the enemy inhibitor and run to Yorick, while the Maiden attacks a nearby inhibitor after instead of the enemy nexus towers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ah1MMULPpU&amp;feature=youtu.be).

(7) **The Maiden of the Mist now 1HKO's all summons as if she were a champion auto-attack**

Any unit that dies from a single auto attack, like Malzahar voidlings, will die from the Maiden's auto attack. The mist walkers will still deal damage based on their AD value like normal.

(8) **The Maiden of the Mist benefits from Lifesteal**

If I build a bloodthrister, the Maiden's auto-attacks are healing Yorick for whatever his lifesteal value is despite the fact that she isn't supposed to and she deals magic damage.

leagueoflegends,2022,1,"Ok so I've been playing league for a while now (5ish years) and most of the time I've been a OTP and mostly stuck to artillery mages. These mages have a unique gameplay style so I found the difficulty of trying to learn other champions fairly difficult. So I decided to look at all the game modes I could go to learn new champs and found that it's.... impossible.

So immediately ranked is off the table as a place to learn a new champ... unless you feel like getting stomped and losing your sanity.

Next up we have draft pick... which sounds like the perfect place to practice a champ casual, relaxed and minimal flaming..... WRONG draft is full of people with play to win attitudes, counter picks and people who will hard freeze a wave just to make your game unplayable.

What about aram? While aram is the best solution to actually learning a champions mechanics, learning how to lane is not possible via aram (though shoutout to aram for being the most chill game mode)

Next up we have blind pick, and lets just scrap blind pick from the beginning due to not being able to confidently get your chosen role... I mean how the fuck am I going to play  Syndra when I'm stuck jungle?

Now Lastly and the most egregious of them all the LTM fun game modes meant for people to try whacky things and have fun... WRONG again.

leagueoflegends,2022,1,"[These statistics](https://i.imgur.com/pflXSjA.jpg) come from League of Graphs/Porofessor. I am a 'Red Side Lover' according to the page-a person with 6%+ increased win rate on Red Side. Now, in my case it looks rather dramatic. 

* I have a 53.7% WR on Red map side. 
* I have a 42.1% win Rate on Blue Side.

 As for the remainder 4.2% ? I don't know what that represents if not a win on Red or Blue. But -if you average those numbers together you get 47.9 , which has roughly been my overall Win Rate for the better portion of  decade. Eight years, albeit I use to play a lot more. I find myself returning to the game. I have about 2200 games. My thoughts are, if I can figure out **WHY** I win on Red, then I can apply those same tactics/correct weaknesses on Blue side and increase my overall WR regardless of side to 53.7%

Now I want to say that it has been known for years that *Blue Side* is **supposed** to have a slightly higher Win Rate. In Ranked solo/duo play this [0.6% higher](https://www.leagueofgraphs.com/rankings/blue-vs-red/na) in Plat. In Bronze League (most of my opponents are Bronze II) the [results are similar](https://www.leagueofgraphs.com/rankings/blue-vs-red/na/bronze). That's a small amount -**not** the 11.6% difference I see in my own games.  

As to why, the reasons vary. Blue supposedly has a better camera angle that allows the dodging of skillshots. If you're a laner in top lane you don't have to Ward the River *and* the tribrush. Blue side also supposedly gets more Dragons and Rift Heralds. And it's supposed to be harder to gank a pushed top lane as a Red Side jungler, because you'd have to go into the enemy jungle. But the thing is....I'm a Red Side jungler. And Im not really able to pinpoint quite why I win so much more.

Have any of you Junglers had this problem? Was your WR gap as dramatic as mine, or worse and could you resolve it?",2022-01-04 06:44:44

I am a 25yo ex-Dota 2 player (5,5k hours) that switched to League after the Arcane series came out (‘cause I fell in love with Jinx, duh). I got an incredible response from you guys to my [previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/r4s2uw/dota_refugee_in_the_search_for_the_answers/) about me learning League, and since then I’ve been grinding this 30th level to get into the ranked by the time the 2022 Season starts. Now I’m just a few games away from this milestone, and I thought that it could be fun for some of you (proper League players, I mean) to get to know my experience of learning your favourite game from scratch in 2021/2022. 

Just a few facts to get started: I’m an ADC player, and I’ve been playing this role almost exclusively since the very start of my League ‘career’ (and I wish those few horrible top and jungle games never happened, honestly). I like to think that my champions pool consists of 6 heroes that I’m pretty confident with at this point, it’s Jinx, Jhin, Kai’sa, Xayah, Ezreal and Caitlyn. And I’m playing EUW, if that changes anything. Will do my best to answer every single question I see, if there are any of course.",2022-01-04 07:17:19

In games nowadays you can die 20 times and still easily be full build by late game due to shutdowns and the general high gold income in the game.

leagueoflegends,2022,1,"I know that this problematic won't touch many players and it's a limitate to just one game mode, but for people who play mostly ARAM, average team comps are becoming really annoying to deal with.

Lux, varus, xerath, velkoz, zoe, ZIGGS, nidalee, kog' maw etc; at least 1 or 2 of them is always present. Doesn't matter how many champs can be available through rolls, people obviously will pick the most safe and frustating (for the opponent) pick and i can't be mad with them, i'd do the same if i get the opportunity.

Poke strategies have risen really fast this preseason (just to nominate some of the adc's one: mandate ashe, lethality jinx, ap mf, etc) and i'm worried that since this game mode is pretty forgotten, it wont receive the proper attention.

Poke is frustrating in lane while in Summoner Rift, but if you play ARAM you know what i mean while i'm writing this post. Literally 20-30 minute of game passed by hugging the tower and being a moving target practice for the enemy. Two or three times in the entire game the least frustating team will try an engage, but that is a 50/50 (more of a 25/75 since the team who get poked will be at half hp). After that you lose/win the game or you return to be a practice dummy for another 10 minutes. Even if i'll win while on the losing side, that'sf NOT a fun game.

We need a system to balance certain champion drops, to make the game fair and overall fun for both team or at least a way to distribute evenly this champions between the two teams. I can fully understand that sometimes i'll still get to play against or with a full poke teams, but that can't be the normality of almost every game. I mean, they always speak about counterplay and how much that parametre can indicate how healthy a champion/mode is, well, in this ARAM enviroment counterplay has few space to begin with.

Please let me know what you think about this.   
(Maybe i should just log off and go touch some grass, i know.)

Sincerely,  
An ARAM player

Edit: I know it's all RANDOM all mid, but statistically speaking even with random rolls, the frequency of some champ is out of the fucking stratosphere, because people mainly pick them and IMO it's becoming an issue.

leagueoflegends,2022,1,"In recent times, I've seen quite a few tank players critique the fact that they're getting killed far faster than they should be, and that they would gladly give up some of their damage if it meant that they're actually tanky. Maybe not as tanky as during the height of season 6 tank meta, but quite a bit tankier.  


When asking them, they often state that the item overhaul caused this issue. With armor penetration now being a viable second item for ADCs while also offering damage against targets with more max HP, and the introduction of Krakenslayer they feel like the main strength of their class is being invalidated.  


This seems odd to me when we take into account that Anathema's Chains reduces an ADCs damage more than the added armor penetration from LDR would increase it, while also being cheaper. Other anti-tank options, like Blade of the Ruined King or the old Black Cleaver, which used to grant more AD and less HP, and therefore was built on few ADCs are quite unpopular nowadays as well.   


If ADC didn't get drastically better at killing tanks, the issue has to be in the other roles. I think that this is very much the case when looking at bruisers/divers.  


bruisers /divers are supposed to be decent/good in every category, while not being top tier in one of them. Renekton for example: Decent CC,  good survivability, good damage, decent mobility.   


Now, tanks are supposed to have great cc, great survivability, low to medium damage, and rather poor mobility. Maokai for example: Good/great CC, great survivability, low damage, slightly better than average mobility compared to most tanks.  


On paper, this is fine, but that's not the reality of the average game. Conqueror, Goredrinker, and shields or healing in most bruiser's kits are making them tankier than actual tanks. Sure, Ornn might have 1.5k more hp in the late-game, and more resistances, but if you include Sustain from items (Goredrinker, Death's Dance) and runes (Conqueror, Triumph) you'll be able to tank more damage when comparing Renekton to Ornn, for example.  


Now, if bruisers/divers have decent CC, better survivability, far higher damage, and greater mobility than tanks, what's the reason to play tanks?  


On the other hand, tanks have decent win rates, which implies that they're still... well... decent. One might say that that's just because they're easy to pick up, as they're not as punishable as squishies while being rather simple in their mechanical need. I believe this to be the case, too. This is why I'm going to look at diamond+ stats for tanks. In diamond, players are decently competent when it comes to mechanics, meaning that the gap because an easy and an hard to play champion won't be as big, because they are better in general.  


Ornn: [52% winrate](https://www.leagueofgraphs.com/de/champions/stats/ornn/top/diamond/sr-ranked) Malphite: [51,3% winrate](https://www.leagueofgraphs.com/de/champions/stats/malphite/top/diamond/sr-ranked) Zac: [51% winrate](https://www.leagueofgraphs.com/de/champions/stats/zac/jungle/diamond/sr-ranked) Sejuani: [51% winrate](https://www.leagueofgraphs.com/de/champions/builds/sejuani/jungle/diamond/sr-ranked)   
Maokai: [53,3% winrate](https://www.leagueofgraphs.com/de/champions/builds/maokai/top/diamond/sr-ranked) Gragas: [52% winrate](https://www.leagueofgraphs.com/de/champions/builds/gragas/top/diamond/sr-ranked) Amumu: 51,3% [winrate](https://www.leagueofgraphs.com/de/champions/builds/amumu/jungle/diamond/sr-ranked)  


The number go against my assumption that tanks suck, they have a slightly above average to significantly above average win rate. Meanwhile, bruisers/divers have slightly above average to below-average win rates.  


Renekton: [50% winrate](https://www.leagueofgraphs.com/de/champions/builds/renekton/top/diamond/sr-ranked) Xin Zhao: [49.5% winrate](https://www.leagueofgraphs.com/de/champions/builds/xinzhao/jungle/diamond/sr-ranked) Lee Sin: [47.5% winrate](https://www.leagueofgraphs.com/de/champions/builds/leesin/jungle/diamond/sr-ranked) Hecarim: [52% winrate](https://www.leagueofgraphs.com/de/champions/builds/hecarim/jungle/diamond/sr-ranked)  
Wukong: [51% winrate](https://www.leagueofgraphs.com/de/champions/builds/monkeyking/top/diamond/sr-ranked) Jarvan: [49.5% winrate](https://www.leagueofgraphs.com/de/champions/builds/jarvaniv/jungle/diamond/sr-ranked) Olaf: [49.8% winrate](https://www.leagueofgraphs.com/de/champions/builds/olaf/jungle/diamond/sr-ranked)

  
While every tank I've looked at had a positive win rate, ranging from 51% to 53.3%, only two bruisers had an above-average win rate, ranging from 51% to 52%. Rest ranged from 47.5% to 50% win rate. Average tank: 51.7%. Average diver/bruiser: 49.9%. 1.8% is not that much, but it proves that a decent amout of tanks does outperform many divers/bruisers.  


The question then is: Am I missing something here, or are tanks actually doing better than divers/bruisers?",2022-01-04 10:02:50

2. Appeal to their desire to win. ""Flaming doesn't help us win"" and variations of that can be useful.
3. Group. If your team won't group as 5, go with the largest group you find.     You can win some skirmishes in the jungle or wherever, and transfer those into a better score, which can mitigate in-game toxicity.
4. Recognize good plays, even on the enemy team. it keeps things more respectful.
5. Highlight your advantage. You may be behind in kills but ahead in towers.    The enemy can have a fed mid but that might be the only one on their team with kills. You may have better late-game, teamfight, splitpushing champs than they do. Make your team consider their strengths rather than their weaknesses.",2022-01-04 10:17:18

Use the rank you ended with this season (S11)!

Don’t lie!! There is nobody to judge you!

Since I can only use 6 options, I separated the options by where I feel to be the largest skill gaps to be. I think tier II to the next rank just have smaller skill gaps than tier 4 and 2 of the same rank - especially d4 to d2. And I think masters 200 is a common skill jump too where a lot of people get stuck at.

But I lose every single game in a row up to even 12 times in a row Bc every game at least one person hard ints. Sometimes it’s top, then mid, then my jungle. I never get a balanced team and I would understand if someone was behind BUT HARD INTING AND FEEDING. EVERY GAME? I’m sorry but wtf. I used to get on league to have a fun time, but now I get on and think to myself “I hope I can win one game today, please just let me win one game” I’m starting to think maybe I’m the issue, but I always have top damage on zyra, I always peel when I’m playing an enchanter and when I get my adc ahead we get shut down Bc someone fed the enemy team so hard.

leagueoflegends,2022,1,"I'm not here to cry about balancing or how strong or weak a role is. I just have a general question about the itemization of both classes.   


ADCs get Shieldbow, which is decent at protecting you against burst, at the cost of having lower damage compared to Kraken or Galeforce. Completely understandable: If you want survivability, you have to give up some damage. 

Other than that, they get Wit's End, Maw, and Guardian Angel. Since Shieldbow and Maw share the same passive, they can't be used in conjunction, leaving you with Guardian Angle and Wit's End. 

Guardian Angel has terrible gold efficiency at 78% while granting no crit or attack speed. The item is really only viable as 4th item due to its lack of variety in stats and gold inefficiency. The last option is Wit's End which is okay. Attack damage, attack speed, and defensive stats with some on-hit damage which is nice against tanks.

So ADCs get 2 defensive items that are a realistic purchase when going up against 2+ magic damage sources (Shieldbow, Wit's End) and 1 item that is decent against both damage types (Shieldbow) Lifesteal offered by Shieldbow should also be mentioned.  


In summary: ADCs can realistically get 1-2 defensive items in most games, which actually is quite a loss in damage. Going for Wit's End means that you won't have enough crit for Infinity Edge to activate at 3 items. Since most games end before you can get 4 Items, and you lose the Kraken / Galeforce damage, you deal a lot less damage.  


  
Mages on the other hand, get Crown of the Shattered Queen, Zhonyas, Banshee's, and many items that grant HP and AP.

Crown of the Shattered Queen grants a wide variety of stats, while also offering protection against burst that can't be directly countered. Serpents Fang counters Shieldbow, but no item counters Crown. Zhonya's is cheaper than Guardian Angel, has a lower cooldown, can be used at will, and offers a wider variety of stats compared to GA. Banshees is cheaper than Wit's End, offers about the same amount of magic resistance and doesn't force you to delay the big power spike item to your 4th buy (Going wit's End means having Infinity 4th, going Banshee's still allows you to go for Rabadon's 3rd)

Cosmic Drive, Horizon Focus, Morellonomicon, Rylai's, Seraph's and Shadowflame also offer HP.  


  
Now, the question is: Why do mages get to build defensive and offensive stats, on cheap, gold efficient items while ADCs have 1 item that is universally helpful but is countered by Serpent's Fang and scales with levels, when ADCs tend to be behind in levels.  


Is the idea that Lifesteal should make up for the lack in HP and resistances or am I missing else?",2022-01-04 12:38:43

For all you out there who think it's fine let me remind you of the number of times Conqueror needed to be changed/nerfed in the past.

This rune is like old Conqueror bad for the game and toxic to play against.  The fact that they don't plan to fix it before season 12 just boggles my mind.

He'd still use two monitors. In his interpretation this does not fall into the category of mods, hacks, cheats, scripts, bots, trainers and automation programs. The solution does not use ANY purpose-written software, not even running on microcontrollers inside the devices, it's all commercially available electronic parts. It obviously doesn't access any data in illegitimate ways.

leagueoflegends,2022,1,"I started league a month ago and after playing a lot of normal games I was invited by a friend to play ranked.

I'm not a good player, I play jungle Vi I'm still learning but when I play normal games it's always a different result, I can dominate like I can be stomped over, I can win like I can lose and I usually have a good time playing.

But when I play ranked it's totally different, Im always behind everybody, sometimes I win, often not but when I win it's never because of me. I feel like everything I learned becomes pointless, just like I'm not the same player that I am when doing normal games.

To be honest I don't really care about toxicity, I'm not a person who feels affected of tilt over some nerd flaming me, so obviously toxicity in ranked doesn't affect me, it's just my level as a player that makes me hate ranked. I don't know if I should continue to play ranked, keep learning in normal and after that going into ranked or just never play ranked ever, am I the only one in this case ?",2022-01-04 16:34:30

leagueoflegends,2022,1,"[Platinum:](https://lolalytics.com/lol/tierlist/?tier=platinum) 50% winrate, 20% banrate.

[Diamond:](https://lolalytics.com/lol/tierlist/?tier=diamond) 51% winrate, 33% banrate.

[Master:](https://lolalytics.com/lol/tierlist/?tier=master) 54% winrate, 48% banrate.

[Grandmaster:](https://lolalytics.com/lol/tierlist/?tier=grandmaster) 51% winrate, 51% banrate.

[Challenger:](https://lolalytics.com/lol/tierlist/?tier=challenger) 54% winrate, 52% banrate.

&amp;#x200B;

So, the first thing is that these winrates directly follow the trend that release Aphelios, Akshan, Gwen, etc. had where worse players play them worse and so supposedly seem to be 'balanced' by their 50% winrate, only for better players to get their mitts on them and show that they are busted.

After seeing my Master+ friends fight Talon jungle, it's safe to say that he is as broken as he's made out to be. Talon has immense safety while counter-jungling, the ability to bypass any wards, great early (which makes punishing him for the counter-jungling even more difficult) and scales well. It doesn't help that his full combo has a 420%-470% AD ratio, 520%-570% if you include Q crit and the following auto, 770% if he uses R, meaning he has damage on par with Zed (a WQER combo from Zed deals 495%\*1.25/1.4/1.55 (618%/693%/767% depending on R rank) AD assuming he hits every Q and every Q deals 110% AD damage instead of 66% like it normally would in a fight) despite supposedly giving up an ability for a utility skill that provides so much safety.

This wasn't so much a problem when Talon was mid, as Talon mid by roaming to get kills was limiting his experience and gold income if he failed to land one. Now, however, Talon gets to have both a reliable gold income and the ability to roam at the same time, which has pushed him into an untenable spot: he is currently *the best jungler*, most picked and banned, in higher elos and his win and banrate have remained pretty stable even following the nerfs on December 15'th which should've in theory had more than this minor effect, as it was a 40% reduction in W damage to monsters.

**Now for the reason for another post like this:** something that would balance Talon without nuking him for non-jungle players is removing the W bonus damage to monsters, moving it to his passive, and balancing it from there. This would slow his clear and make it less healthy (since he now has to individually attack the smaller jungle monsters to kill them) and give him the same sort of weaknesses that other 'I no care about wall' junglers like Kayn and Shaco have. It would also serve to add some counterplay to his jungling, as he now has to use Q to steal camps and the DoT from his passive could be countered by hitting the jungle camp at just the right time, thereby adding some risk to his counterjungling instead of keeping it both safe and effective as it is now.",2022-01-04 16:37:14

leagueoflegends,2022,1,"I have heard of the popular ""Jungle Wall"" idea on how to keep junglers AWAY from lanes at the beginning of the game. I like the spirit of this idea, but with the obscene amount of mobility in the game (*COUGH* KAYN *COUGH*) that would only hurt *some* junglers and buff others. I have dabbled greatly in the jungle, I like the jungle (in theory). The scuttle changes were a godsend for someone who did not like coinflip minute 3 fights. I like the dynamic macro style of play but I **DON'T** like getting flamed every second because I can't be everywhere at all times. And I know laners don't like getting camped from level 1. With the upcoming changes to TP, it is clear Riot wants to minimize early game clown fiesta cheese...


...So... To keep the integrity of the jungle role but minimize the earlygame stress and responsibility, and perhaps streamline the role to make it more appealing (considering it is the least popular role)... I propose the **GLOWING RIVER**!


**For the first 5 minutes of the game (until first dragon spawn), the river glows and gives vision to both teams (excluding bushes).** This gives an even clearer map dividing line, gives a safety blanket for laners early, increases the difficulty of early game ganks/invades (but doesn't invalidate them), allows junglers to couter-scuttle easily, and also frees everyone to place deeper wards/lane wards early.


Junglers still have the chance to duke it out with the other jungler, make their plays, or simply farm up. If you're a blitzcrank main and cry about no minute zero 5 man invades, maybe make the glowing river begin from first creep spawn to allow for a little cheese, or a deep ward. I would love some input because I do feel like this is a serious win-win for laners and junglers (unless you are mlg pro no-scoper or a filthy kayn player).",2022-01-04 18:22:43

leagueoflegends,2022,1,"Lately there has again been an increased interest in punishing ""badly"" behaving players, leaving people upset that Riot does not do enough.

Unfortunately many people are not aware that this is a much more difficult problem than they would think. To detect a bad behaving player, Riot relies on reports and player statistics. Both of those are often ambiguous. First of all, many people report others for having a bad game. Second, to take action based on player statistics there needs to be clear evidence for ""bad"" behaviour. You can't ban someone for having a few bad games. The evidence needs to be clearly above background noise, which will take some time and in many cases it's hard to tell whether someone is actively trolling or just playing badly (of course there are some obvious trolls but for each of those, there will be thousands of ambiguous cases).

So while having a human staff member look at each and every game would be ideal, it is not financially feasible in any way and would in most cases not even help too much.

What would however help is something similar to Valve's trust score system. But more in the form of a karma system. The simplest variation could be based entirely on reports (basically Riot has already implemented this with the honour system). But instead of linking high honour levels to in-game rewards, it could be used to match players with high honour levels in the same team. So players that behave nicely will be more likely placed with other players that behave nicely, while the opposite is true for the others. This would not only give people that behave nicely a good reason for doing so but may also lead those that don't to reflect more on their actions or just land in a cesspool of trolls. 

This certainly is not a new idea nor perfect but may be one of the simplest and best measures against toxic behaviour that would not require too much effort from Riot. And before people start calling for abuse, of course loosing players will report each other but statistically this evens out and less toxic players will get less reports (relatively speaking). Additionally, positive and negative feedback from pre-mades should not be included.",2022-01-04 20:05:40

The last legendary variant skin we got was Yasuo's- a texture swap ( quite literally, if you check the files ) and color swap between their models and abilities.   


However there have been other legendary skins that, a lot of people would like to see a variant of- *especially* the star guardians Ahri, Jinx, Xayah and Rakan.   
A variant of True Damage Ekko or Project: Yi. You know, basically skin upgrades like what was done with SG Soraka and Bewitching Morgana.  
It's quite literally one of the easiest cash grabs.  


A lot of skin universe lore goes stale, while many people who love the skinline have their thumbs up their butts waiting for the next release. However Riot never progresses the lore without something to sell. We don't need a massive character dump, for example Pentakill did pretty frickin well with it's off-kilter event- but there was still skins to sell.  


I don't think anyone who's a fan of the skin universes are going to complain about a rerelease of who the champion in that universe currently or could be- with a few new voicelines and some easy ability texture replacements ( trails are literally a drag and drop change ) with a variant discount.

leagueoflegends,2022,1,"Riot games does not maintain a fair competitive ladder as far as i'm concerned; and they're not willing to prove otherwise because they keep everything a secret.   


I've heard rumors such as the algo knows if you're a smurf or not within the first 30 seconds of the game because of APM ( Actions Per Minute ) which will effect future games.   


Winners que and Losers que are more or less verifiably real; and smurf que is broadcasted as a solution to a problem that creates a bigger problem for returning players.   


If you're a high skill player who took a long break from the game you're likely to come back flagged as a smurf. Instead of having a fun time climbing and getting comfortable with the game you will be placed into a totally new form of ELO HELL unlike anything that used to exist in this game.   


Being stuck playing with all smurfs regardless of your elo and having no real sense of what it feels like to play at the rank you're at until the clamp comes off. Once you're out all of the sudden its win streak time until you win too many games and the system puts you into losers que or back into smurf que.   


If all of the above is supposedly false then why all the shrouded mystery in the matchmaking system?  


The game should be randomized matchmaking based on your position on the ladder; thats it. Mixing in mmr and bs matchmaking to set up players to lose and or win in champ select undermines the competitive integrity of this game.   


And you wonder why the West has more or less died in the E Sports Scene?  


The ladder legit works against you the better you are to make it harder for you to climb; instead of letting gifted players climb fast enough to be able to consider that they should take being a pro seriously they instead just get stuck in the ALGO and expire.   


We need a new matchmaking system and also we need a way to get removed from being put in smurf que games like 2 factor auth or something.   


A new player coming back to the game shouldn't have to suffer through this abuse with a pat on the head "" It will all be ok just lose a bunch and you will then be in normal matches ""

leagueoflegends,2022,1,"On patch 10.23 Riot changed tear into a Basic item with this effect

UNIQUE PASSIVE - MANA CHARGE: Grants a charge every 8 seconds, up to 4 charges. Affecting an enemy or ally with an ability consumes a charge and grants 3 bonus mana, increased to 6 if it's a champion, up to maximum of 450 bonus mana.

This enabled champions such as Draven, Kog'Maw, Sivir, and Udyr to stack tear on every AA with their empowered Autos.

On 11.3 Draven had lost the ability to stack Tear with Q without this being documented anywhere.

On 11.5 Udyr was bugfixed with ""Fixed a bug where Udyr was able to trigger Tear of the Goddess' mana charge with every attack"".
With this Udyr change Kog'Maw W, Sivir W, Kassadin W, and potentially Hecarim E lost the ability to stack Tear which if this is an intended nerf was never documented.

On 11.6 Kassadin was bugfixed to have W stack tear again.
On 11.21 Hecarim was bugfixed to have E stack tear again.

Kog'Maw, Sivir, and Draven are yet to receive either a bugfix or confirmation that this interaction was never intended.


Since examples are needed here are some showing stacking and not stacking. Getting perfect patch dates for each is difficult due to it requiring an uploaded video along with them building tear.

leagueoflegends,2022,1,"Currently, Quinn sees a 1.4% pick rate in Top lane, and is more of a rushdown counter-pick against melee champions. She falls off hard in every other role and has a sub-0.1% pick rate, even as an ADC, which she was originally designed to be.

Quinn is also one of the very few dedicated top laners that can't jungle. Her clear speed is utterly atrocious until she hits a 2 item power spike, and she can't reliably gank until level 6. By then your enemy jungler will have shat all over your teammates and you'll probably be flamed and reported 4x.

If Riot want more champions to be played in the jungle or as supports, why not start by buffing this champion?

There are six very easy design changes that could make her at least semi-viable in other roles, by either improving her early game scouting, her ability to clear minions, or even her abilities, opening up the way for AP Quinn.

Q - Blinding Assault:

* Damage and disarm duration increased by 150% against monsters. - *Q is almost never worth maxing out first because it deals atrocious damage. Why not make it deal good damage against monsters so Quinn can actually clear camps?*
* AP Ratio buffed to 70% of AP, from 50%? - *Why does Quinn have 50% AP scaling on her Q again? It's like Riot wanted to make AP Quinn a thing but couldn't be arsed to complete her moveset when they reworked her. Also, 50% scaling on one ability is just bad.*

W - Heightened Senses:

* Active: Cooldown reduced to 35 seconds for all ranks, down from 50/45/40/35/30 - *It's a 2 second reveal on a 50 second cooldown, which is effectively worthless in the early game. Lowering the earlier game cooldown would improve her viability as a support massively.*

E - Vault:

* Damage increased by 200% against monsters. - *Similar story with Quinn's Q. Not actually worth maxing out because it deals really bad damage, but it is a slow.*
* Now also scales from 80% of AP - *See also the reason for buffing Q's AP scaling. Riot should either remove the AP scaling outright or do what they did to Twitch and make it an alternative playstyle.*

R - Skystrike: 

* Also scales from AP, dealing 60% AP damage. - *See also reason for buffing Q's AP scaling*",2022-01-04 22:53:48

I'm just kidding that's not a cat. Now even tho this is a skin for Teemo, this look is repeated not just for skins but in Legends of Runeterra and many other Yordles where Riot's designs for Yordles often fluctuate from usually smaller ears on top and larger ears on the side.

Now originally Riot intended to Update old Yordle designs to bring them all in line with a more common theme, take Kled for example, fuzzy guy still but with larger ears on the side like poppy and Trist, and now even Lulus smaller ears have been updated on Wild Rift and in LoR.

But Riot chickened out because of how Iconic Teemo is on his updates so he never got the change and I think that deviation has allowed so many other Yordles to basically go with this Cat like design which I think undermines the integrity of what Yordles should look like.

leagueoflegends,2022,1,"I feel like we have had the same few themes of champion design throughout the last few champions in terms of theme. While Riot has made some really cool designs, I feel like there are some categories that are neglected

&amp;#x200B;

For example, I believe the last time we had an original champion in clad armor or just overall big plate armor was Darius. I believe the last time we got a proper tank champion was Ornn. The last time we got a real monster champion I cannot even recall.

&amp;#x200B;

I would love to see some of these concepts revisited, I was really hoping when Viego came out would resemble something similar to Sauron or The Lich King, but instead we had a skinny kid with a six pack shirtless

leagueoflegends,2022,1,"Riot has previously stated that they try to avoid seasonal/holiday based skinlines due to issues with popularity in countries outside of their origin.

  
However, I do think there are ways to manage these skin lines in interesting ways to build hype and keep relevance even in other countries.

&amp;#x200B;

# Seasonal Celebrations!

&amp;#x200B;

So the idea here is to keep hype throughout the season by releasing gradual skins rather than a bunch at one time. I think that people may be more interested in buying skins/staying in tune with the new skins being released if they feel more like a special event/a weekly schedule.   


Along with the new release schedule, we should also be seeing 4 short stories each year. Each short story focusing on a fictional runeterra based celebration.

&amp;#x200B;

 For example!

During the winter seasons the children of Frejlord must survive through the coldest winter temperatures. They use folklore about the Frejlordian gods to entertain themselves, even mentioning the legendary Braum here and there. Some children have even started whispers of a reindeer who warms your cold dreams while you sleep... but no one has managed to spot them yet.

&amp;#x200B;

By creating these stories we get a lot of great thing. New Runeterra lore, a possible disconnection from religious events (Christmas), and skins that have to do with holidays/festivals outside of players native regions may now be more interesting to them. 

&amp;#x200B;

\---

&amp;#x200B;

**Winter**

&amp;#x200B;

The Winter Celebration stars the week of December 21st, kicking off with 2 Yule/Christmas skins. Starting the first week of January, we start our transition into Chinese New Year. Each week three-four skins are released to celebrate Chinese new year, this lasts into the first week of CNY. The final week will conclude with a zodiac based skin (A Tiger for this year) that will have a prestige! Into February 4-6 valentines day based skins will be released over two weeks.

&amp;#x200B;

**Spring**

&amp;#x200B;

Spring will start sometime in Early/Mid march with the Zhonghe Festival. 1-2 skins should be rolled out over 1-2 weeks. Between Zhonghe and Bunny day, we should get ""flower"" or ""plant"" related skinlines, possibly similar to Elderwood or Lotus. During the first week of winter we should get Bunny day, getting skinlines focused around cute animals. Over the next few weeks into June we should get 6-10 Bee, Bunny, Puppy, Kitty, and other cutesy skinlines (Possibly Cafe-cuties). Early may could also feature a Labor day/tourism based skinline to coincide with the Chinese labor day. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Summer**

&amp;#x200B;

Of course, Summer will start off with Pool/Beach party. These skins will be produced periodically throughout the first month of Summer. We could also possibly include Spirit blossom skins during this time period since it coincides somewhat with Zhong Yuan Jie (Ghosts/Spirits Festival).

&amp;#x200B;

**Autumn**

&amp;#x200B;

Autumn will start off with the Chinses Moon festival, Zhongqiu. During this time, we can expect a few skins possibly based around Lunari champions as well as maybe a revamp of the baker skinline. As we transition into October, we will of course be seeing our Halloween/Cinco De Mayo skinlines. Over the four weeks of October we should get 6-8 Halloween/Witchy skins. On the last week of October, we'll see 1-2 Day of the dead skins as well.",2022-01-05 00:25:47

leagueoflegends,2022,1,"Chart at bottom

EDIT: Updated chart to incorporate Guinsoo's ""apply on-hit effects twice each third attack"" effect ***and*** removed ""base"" from in front of ""attack damage"" everywhere to curb confusion.

EDIT: Which item/mechanic comparison should I do next?

TLDR: Guinsoo's grants a surprising amount of dps

First, I want to briefly discuss the relevant mechanics just so we're all on the same page:

Normal critical strike mechanic: a critical strike deals 175% of attack damage.

Guinsoo's Mechanic: Do not deal critical strikes. Instead, convert crit chance to on-hit damage equal to 40 attack damage per 20 critical strike chance.

Normal crit strike mechanic dps =  *Attack Speed* \* ( \[chance to ***not*** critically strike\]\*\[attack damage\] + \[chance to critically strike\]\*\[1.75\*attack damage\] )  ---  example, with 60% crit chance, 100 AD, and attack speed of 1.00: dps = 1.00 \* ((0.4\*100) + (0.6\*1.75\*100)) = 145 dps

Guinsoo's dps =  *Attack Speed* \* \[ {2/3\*(attack damage + on-hit damage from Guinsoo's)} + { (1/3)\*(attack damage + ***2***\*on-hit damage from Guinsoo's) } \] --- example. with 60% crit chance. 100 AD, and attack speed 0f 1.00: = 1.00 \* \[ 2/3\*(100+40\*60/20) + 1/3\*(100+2\*40\*60/2) \] = 259.6 dps

&amp;#x200B;

Using the above mechanics, I created this chart to show the difference in dps when using Guinsoo's versus when not using Guinsoo's. The x-axis is just attack damage and the y-axes are the difference between Guinsoo's dps and normal crit mechanic dps and the Guinsoo's dps as a percentage of normal crit mechanic dps, both with equivalent stats. When making this chart, the only stats allowed to vary are base attack damage and critical strike chance. Attack speed only changes the magnitude of the dps for a given base AD, it does not change where each line would cross the x-axis. Because it doesn't affect the conclusions the data provides, I used an attack speed of 1.50 to create this chart because it is a reasonable value of attack speed for marksmen during the mid/early-late game game.

**Conclusions to be drawn:** First, the dps increase granted by Guinsoo's is more dramatic as crit chance increases. This makes sense, since the additional on-hit damage it grants directly scales with crit chance. Second, the increase in dps granted by Guinsoo's diminishes as base attack damage increases when compared to the normal crit mechanic dps at the same base AD and crit chance. This, again, makes sense since the on-hit Guinsoo's damage is a flat value while bonus critical strike damage scales with base AD (at 75% of base AD). Finally, the percentage increase in dps granted solely by the crit-into-on-hit damage mechanic is staggering early on. If purchased as a first item or as your only source of crit chance your dps increases by \~30% *more* than it would if you simply bought an item/items that gave equivalent crit and attack speed.

# So what does mean?

EDIT: I was a fool to put my opinion on here too, lol. I'm just gonna give you guys the facts and let you do with them what you will.

Guinsoo's ~~should be an early buy for all AD marksmen. Its~~ effect on your dps is arguably the most dramatic of all marksmen-centric legendary items early on, even compared to Infinity Edge (gain an additional 35% crit damage if at least 60% crit chance). The additional 35% means a critical strike will deal 210% of base attack damage (110% additional damage). Using these numbers and 60% crit chance, the normal critical strike mechanic dps with IE overcomes Guinsoo's dps at about 242 AD. This a lower value than 340, the approximate amount of AD where the normal crit mechanic begins to deal more damage than the Guinsoo's mechanic. One that is somewhat reasonably attainable in an actual game. IE vs Guinsoo's is a legitimate debate. ~~I would argue, however, that Guinsoo's is better because of the ridiculous added attack speed that it grants (45%!), its synergy with Kraken Slayer, and that it feels better with equivalent stats. The 45% attack speed is nothing to laugh at either. This a large amount of attack speed coming from a single item, and attack speed is arguably the most important stat for marksmen these days. This allows you a lot more freedom and flexibility to buy items to properly adapt to the composition of the enemy lane/team. Instead of being locked into a long, expensive, and (mostly) inflexible item progression to get an equivalent attack speed bonus, Guinsoo's is a one-and-done giving you a huge boost to attack speed and dps to use to continue to out-scale the enemy.~~

Please comment with your thoughts and critiques.

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: u/Erknaite also pointed out that Randuin's Omen does not mitigate the on-hit damage from Guinsoo's like it would for the damage added to crits by IE. Not super important, but worth mentioning

You just have to pray for a fast-dive comp to interact with her. Her W is as far-range and huge as it is to combo with her R, but artillery kaisa never has to risk anything and go in. All she needs to do is land Ws, which is one of the easiest abilities to land because of how massive it is. In summoner's rift, chaining together Ws takes skill in knowing where enemies are and predicting their movement, but in ARAM, the lane is so narrow that it does most of the hard work for you. This, coupled with the fact that there are 5 people crammed in that lane means you can fire a W blind past the minions and most of the time you'll at least hit someone. Once she hits W, it goes on a 2.5 second cooldown, on an ability that can easily deal third or half a champion's HP. For reference, kaisa W has 50% more width than morgana Q, nearly triple the range, and moves almost 50% faster.
