VALORANT,2020,2,Valorant theme song leaked ???!!??,2020-02-27 09:53:04
VALORANT,2020,3,"Hi, welcome to the ***VALORANT*** subreddit. As the team behind it, we hope this becomes the official subreddit because it's the shortest thing to type. That said, if all of you want to go elsewhere to talk about the game, we'll follow.

If it wasn't obvious, we set this thing up with the help of previous community moderators and leaders known to us and will now **be passing off ownership to them.** The agreement here is that they'll act as the starter seed of mods who will then begin recruiting positive figures from the VALORANT community who want to keep all of us in check. Reddit is obviously a huge, crazy, *crazy huge* platform when it comes to putting eyeballs on things, and we want to make sure whoever's supporting the community doesn't *also* want their content to be on the front page of that community. It's fine to be one or the other, but typically not both.

Anyway, that's about it. The whole team is crazy hyped to finally be able to talk about this game - we love it and hope you love it too when you get in. More importantly, we hope you all become a VALORANT community *of* love: one that celebrates competition and skill and creativity, but also audacity and style and high-risk plays for the sake of it. This game is going to be hard to master but also (hopefully) worth the effort - let's bring together a global tribe of friends who make the journey as fun as the destination.

The team will be here to say hi - also I'll give out a random 5k RP to whoever shitposts the best, as dictated by me exhaling slightly out of the nose upon reading. This isn't an assumption that anyone who wants to play VALORANT plays League (I wonder about the crossover) but it's all I have to give.

If you're wondering when closed beta begins, follow us on:

* [twitter](https://www.twitter.com/playvalorant) 
* [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/playvalorantofficial) 
* [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/playvalorant) 

.. and maybe they'll tell you one day. There's definitely some cool stuff planned.

We'll swing by and do a proper AMA in the coming weeks once we get some other things locked down, but feel free to ask questions as we go and we'll be available. Happy discussing, folks.",2020-03-02 07:22:19

VALORANT,2020,3,"for preface im from a cs background and have had some experience playing at a competitive level through some lans and online leagues/tournaments so these are some things I found to seem important from a **CS PLAYER POV**.

* I did not see any sort of **'defuse kit'-like item** in the buy menu, but that's not to say that a champ/hero may or may not have an ability to decrease defuse time. after counting the defuse time from the round video, it seemed that it was around *8 seconds or so* (correct me if im wrong)
* **the in-game voice quality is really nice!** its refreshing to know that we can go into a team-based game with a well-establish communication system. one thing im curious on, which I highly doubt will happen, is whether there will be a point in the match in which there is interaction between the two teams. i remember in CSGO a few years ago, shit talking the enemy at half-time or at end of the match was a thing and honestly I think it not only gave the chance for '*friendly banter*' but it also gave the players another sort of possible 'motivation' to win the match they are in.
* \-in the buy menu, **you seem to 'buy' access to your abilities**. to some this might be compared to buying grenades in other FPS games. another major thing I noticed in the round gameplay video was the ability to **BUY FOR OTHERS, ASK FOR WEAPONS/ETC FROM OTHERS, AND OVERALL GIVE BASIC COMMS SUCH AS ""Let's Save""**. along the same subject, I really have to say that the buy menu is *really* well done and seems very easy to navigate.
* \-**the crosshair system** seems very similar to CSGO's and im excited to know that we the players are given access to personalize our own.
* **there seems to be an almost 30-second 'setup' time for what I am assuming is the CT side** that we were able to see in the gameplay video. with this teams are able to create set-pieces and tactics that might otherwise seem difficult without the '*grace period*' that we are given.
* **you can pick up and drop weapons** for your teammates similarly to CSGO. though it should seem like a no-brainer mechanic to have in an FPS, im glad to know definitely that it is present
* **the mini-map system and UI in general seem very sleek and do not take up a whole lot of the player's POV/screen.** It also is fairly *calm* which is a great thing in my eyes. excited to see what UI customization is available to the players on release (HUD Color, Scaling, etc)
* when it comes to movement, it's hard to tell just how good or bad it is without physically playing, however I do notice that again, similarly to CSGO and other FPS games, **movement speed increases with knife/melee(?) out.**
* **the damage report is very informative** in the fact that **not only does it show how much damage you each did to each other, but also where on the body you were and the other person was hit, as well as with what weapon the damage was done.**
* **recoil patterns do seem to exist,** so there will be more than likely different spreads for each weapon

i think i covered almost everything that stood out to me, but honestly after rewatching the gameplay, i will probably find something new. in general, im really excited for this game and what it all has to offer and i think the promise is there for it to blow some major names out of the water. let me know in the comments if there was anything you guys found interesting and why! looking more forward than ever to grinding this game out in hopes of becoming the greatest. *see you all in game* \^\_\^ - **cohnah**",2020-03-02 08:36:51

VALORANT,2020,3,"A pretty cool idea that came to my mind when I first saw the characters in Valorant was Crossover Events. Some of the Characters look similar to League of Legends Champions and we could get Skins based on League Champions.

Events and Missions could be pretty cool, Skins or Maps based on League and who knows, maybe a Valorant event in League (as the Continent in League is called Valoran)

Another thing that came to mind was Missions and Rewards similar to the Overwatch and Heroes of The Storm Missions. For those of you who aren't aware, you used to be able to play HotS for a Overwatch Genji and D.Va Skin. I think something like that should exist in Valorant and League, it could bring new players to both games.

What other things do you expect Riot to do?

Personally togheter with what I mentioned i'd also like custom Gun Skins, Skins that you could design yourself and maybe a Marketplace?",2020-03-02 10:25:13

But here I can legitimately say ""it's CS with grenades replaced with Overwatch abilities"", and anyone who played both games will immediately have a very accurate representation of Valorant.

So I'm wondering, who is this for ?

Most CS players won't move, I mean, CS Source was already too different for most of them.

Overwatch players probably won't move, the absence of respawn alone would probably drives them away.

I personally don't like either of those (I think CS is kind of boring, and Overwatch meta is too stiff), but I always wanted something in-between. But this is not in-between, it's a CS clone sprinkled with particles of Overwatch.",2020-03-02 11:28:55

I'm someone who has been passionate about the CS:GO for years and years, and this game intrigues me.  So I thought this would be the perfect opportunity to combine by love for statistics and analytics with something else I could potentially fall in love with! A shooter. 

So what's this promise?

Annyway, I wantes to adress the maps, they seem cool don't get me wrong, they just seem a little too box-ish (?) Kinda like a Minecraft Costom map.

I'd love to see Riot make some more fluid maps or just *parts* of the maps. Really all I'm seeing is a bunch of boxes wich can be good for a better understanding of the battlefield and will be important in proffesional play, I'm just saying a little more fluidity wouldn't hurt.

VALORANT,2020,3,"[via polygon](https://www.polygon.com/2020/3/2/21158439/valorant-system-requirements-pc-specs-minimum-recommended)

# PC HARDWARE RECOMMENDATIONS

* Windows 7/8/10 64 bit
* 4GB RAM
* 1GB VRAM

#  MINIMUM SPECS — 30 FPS

According to Riot, the baseline hardware that you’ll need to run the game at just 30 frames-per-second is basically equivalent to an older laptop, and won’t even need a dedicated graphics card. Unfortunately, at just 30 FPS, you won’t have the easiest time out-aiming players with faster computers, but you’ll at least be able to play Valorant pretty well.

* CPU: Intel i3-370M
* GPU: Intel HD 3000

#  RECOMMENDED SPECS — 60 FPS

&gt;60 FPS should give players a pretty good experience with the game. Running the game with these specs should let you hang with just about anyone in terms of aim, and your computer shouldn’t slow down when abilities start going off and rounds start to get chaotic.

* CPU: Intel i3-4150
* GPU: Geforce GT 730

#  HIGH-END SPECS — 144+ FPS

&gt;These are the specs you’ll want if you want to be the hardest of hardcore *Valorant* players. At 144 FPS you’ll be maxing out most consumer monitors’ refresh rates, and guaranteeing that you’re seeing every frame the game can give you. As far as this kind of top-end performance goes, these specs aren’t particularly demanding, and most gaming computers built within the last few years should have no trouble getting *Valorant* to run at over 144 FPS. Of course, just like any shooter, more frames may help you see things better, but the frames can’t learn to aim for you.

* CPU: Intel Core i5-4460 3.2GHz
* GPU: GTX 1050 Ti",2020-03-02 13:52:05
VALORANT,2020,3,"My knowledge is strictly limited to the gameplay videos shown and one article about the characters skillset. I also played OW and CS go a decent amount.  


My point is actually pretty simple. They wanted to make an ability based shooter where the gunplay is still important. How can they do that? Few damaging ability and tons of utility. People had bad experience with ""wallhack"" type abilities (or hack lol) so they hate even the ide of it in a ""skillbased shooter"". Wh is op in a vacuum, but big secret, you should watch the whole game to judge. As far as I know the sensor spells are still quite tricky to use in a sense that you have to have a line of sight  from the arrow or drone or whatever to actually see something. But the more important thing is, for every ""wh"" spell there are like 2 vision denial spells from other characters so IMO it would be unplayable without those sensors. There are other games with these kind of abilities where they pulled it off smoothly, like the hanzo arrow or widow ult, so just give them a chance.  


Also if you think the abilites are too monumental or have too big impact just go back to cs:go they won't tune down the only thing that makes their game different.",2020-03-02 13:53:14

VALORANT,2020,3,"This game seems to amplify that issue significantly. 

Between all the walls and obscuring abilities, I have a feeling it's going to create some frustration with players. Especially those coming from CSGO, which seem to be the target audience. 

I dunno. Just seems like a lot going on at all times. Central zones are going to be completely covered with these obscuring abilities and teamfights are going to devolve into chaos. Once a meta forms, parts of the map are always going to be shut down 100% of the time, which can lead to stagnation and stale gameplay.

Edit: you all can disagree with me but character design is clearly going in this direction. We will have to wait and see I guess",2020-03-02 14:11:32

VALORANT,2020,3,"**It's the amount of HP we have.**

It doesn't seem that important for CSGO players because in general, a gunfight rarely ends with both players alive. It's decided instantly with very few shots.

However, in games like Overwatch, where abilities are present, there's an HP pool large enough to back away to safety. heal. whatever.

&amp;#x200B;

**Here's is the problem : Is this game more of a CSGO or an Overwatch in terms of HP pool ?**

* If it's more CSGO : RECON and REVIVE abilities will be extremely important and powered. healing isn't worth it if you die instantly. Aggressive abilities like dashes won't be used. Except Grenades-like abilities.
* If it's more like OW : RECON and REVIVE will be important. But as much as Healing. we will see  a more diverse meta.

In any RPG, HP pool is important, its very existence is the reason we have the time to cast spells.

**In a FPS with low HP pool, I don't see any value to spells when you can spent your money on better weapons. So I hope this has been thought of during game design!**",2020-03-02 14:36:27

VALORANT,2020,3,"First of all I want to thank everyone who helped in dev this game and I hope this will be a succes!

 Alright guys so I wanted to talk about a character in the game. Let me introduce you to our MOROCCAN agent ""Cypher"" !  
Well, let's do this! I also wanna thank you all for your support.  
So just to be sure and make things clear there is no secret safe in Valorant when Cypher is in the game Detective!

He got some awesome stuff like :

• Trapwire  
• Cyber Cage  
• Signature Ability: Spycam  
• Ultimate Ability: Neural Theft

Cypher is a one-man surveillance network who keeps tabs on the enemy’s every move. No secret is safe. No maneuver goes unseen. Cypher is always watching.

• Free Ability: Trapwire - Place a stealthed tripwire between two walls. Triggering enemies are restrained and revealed for a short time. If the trap is not destroyed, it activates to daze the trapped victim. Can be picked up.  
• Cyber Cage - Toss out a remote activation trap. Reactivate to create a cage that slows enemies who pass through it. Look at a trap and press USE to detonate it, or hold ACTIVATE to detonate all.  
• Signature Ability: Spycam - Place a remote camera. After placing, reactivate to view the video feed. Left click while in camera to fire a tracking dart. Recharges when picked up or killed.  
• Ultimate: Neural Theft- Extract information from the corpse of an enemy, revealing the location of their living allies.

VALORANT,2020,3,"After today's release, I've seen what the current characters (or champions? Idk how they're officially called) can do and some of them look really interesting to me. Here are my first impressions on each one:

* **PHOENIX**: this is one that really caught my attention. His flame walls are useful to take out enemy sight of your team and his ultimate allows him to invade and get intel without worring about being punished as he will respawn right after, even having the chance of getting a kill in the process. Plus, it's specially useful if he is low on health, as he spawns with full health.
* **JETT:** it's not clear for me how useful her daggers are. Sure, they kill on headshots, but don't most of the other weapons do it as well? She can jump high, which might be an advantage to reach potential shooting points, but other than that I don't see much use for her.
* **VIPER:** useful for causing area damage, but even more useful to defend a bomb site with her ultimate. Her gas don't kill (aside Snakebite), but it causes Decay damage that heals after time, so I believe she is an amazing duo for all the other characters.
* **SOVA:** the abilities that tag enemies and the drone (specially the drone) are amazing. Droning is crucial in tactical games like this, specially in situations of invading or retaking bomb sites. Plus, the ""Hanzo arrows"" that tag enemies make excellent combos with Phoenix and Viper, for example.
* **CYPHER:** at first, his abilities seem good but I think they would be the kind of things players get used to search for after some time playing, killing the ""surprise element"". His ultimate is good, though, and his camera will be amazing if it can be placed anywhere regardless of height.
* **BRIMSTONE:** interesting character, but I wonder how will his gameplay be indoors. Will all the maps in Valorant have a great outdoor section?
* **SAGE:** another one that I think will find place in every team, as her ressurection and healing abilities are extremely useful. Her walls make it even easier to take care of wounded teammates.
* **OMEN:** his ultimate is extremely useful, but the rest of his abilities look like... somewhat of a nerfed Reaper? (from Overwatch)

&amp;#x200B;

Of course I need to play first in order to have a solid impression, but on a first glance I would find more sinergy in a team composed by Phoenix, Viper, Sage, Sova and... maybe Brimstone or Omen?",2020-03-02 17:18:00

I would much rather they implement ADS and hipfire how most modern FPS are doing it like Rainbow six Siege, Battlefield, etc. Having visual recoil and precision only by ADSing leads to a much more satisfying gunplay in my opinion.

VALORANT,2020,3,"It will be a lot of text, but there is a lot of new info so it's worth a read.*I want to state that he wasn't paid by Riot, he was just answering questions*

At the time, alfa testers could play only 2 maps - one of which is 3 sites map shown on the footage, and second is 2 sided map.

**That second map has 2 teleports which as a ct you can travel to second bombsite**, but only once (once you teleport you can't come back). He said it really changes the pace of map, but he liked 3-sided more 

But let's start from the beginning. There ware 8 characters but defs are working at 4 more which will be propably released with premiere. Every character has 4 abilities: 2 of them you can buy (in different amount for different characters), one is available in every round after cooldown (30/40 seconds - it depends) and one **ultimatum which you can't buy**. Instead you have to get points. Every point is counted by: kill, death, or you can pick orbs - there are 2 of them on the same spot resping every round. It takes 7/8 points to get ult.

**Maybe most important info about the game is that trailer doesn't really show how it feels**. He was saying that they are clearly overusing abilities just to show them in the short period of time. They are not more then addition, and not single one is better then precise aim or good movement. It's not optimal to use them so much as shown, because they are not so good - we won't see them as frequently. It's easy to counterplay them, they are easily noticable and you can't avoid them(shooting down wallhack arrow for example, rushing dron deployer, spamming mid air dart thrower). If you have good aim - you will still have an advantage 

**Weapons are clearly overworked cs weapons** There is AWP, scout, galil, famas, m4 with silencer, ak-47, smgs, shotguns and pistols, really same thing. Only diffrence is that they are two or three weapons that you can zoom in, and it changes the way you are shooting. For example there is weapon thay you can spray with, but if you zoom in you will be able to burst only. There is weapon that you can tap only too (it has 12 bullets)

Movement is similar to cs, but acceleration is visibly smaller. It results with that you can't really be killed by jiggle peaking.

**Shooting is 1 to 1 taken from cs go** Players from cs will have huge advantage over new or OW players. (PashaBiceps [cs go ex pro] for example when he was focused on killing, not using abilities - had 29 kills for map) Spraying is same as in cs, but patterns are diffrent. You are even less accurate than in cs while running.

Edit: Sounds are very clear, footsteps even more noticeable than in CS,  most of abilities can be heard as well

Edit: One funny thing: in CS there was an update with a menu that changes crosshair. He said that some alpha tester had to leak Valorant system to Valve because it's too similar. (As you can see CS is already trying to concur with it)

Edit: And a one big thing. There will be a new system called shadow of war or smth like that, which doesn't give your PC information where the enemies stand till you see them. It's supposed to be a weapon with cheaters. Edit: it appears to be in cs as well

On the downsides he said that movement feels a little bit too slow for him, and maps are too flat.

To summerize - it's cs with new stuff. **In his opinion it will be very attractive to cs go community**, and he thinks that **this game have huge potential, which isn't visible on the trailers**. Personally he loved it, in his opinon its in some aspects better than cs go and will hugely affect it (note that he has over 9k hours in cs) but he didn't like trailer

This is the one thing keeping my grounded. The Korean shooter art style has been by biggest concern since the reveal during the 10th year celebration stream. The toothpick visual models do not typically do well outside of the Asia scene. For a lot of people it makes character movement look weirdly snappy, to the point of souring the experience. Every person has their own tastes, and that's fine. At least people will be able to use stretched res to customize the look and fe-

Oh no. I know this is Riot Games first shooter, but look. Visual customization is a huge factor in competitive fps games. With this game catching the eyes of many CS:GO and R6 players, no stretched res is a big problem. A lot of people like their game looking dummy thicc. Let them play like that. It's only going to make more people like the look and feel of you game.

VALORANT,2020,3,"I know we don't know yet as to what the esport scene will look like, but I am terrified for Valorant's based off of the League of Legends scene. 

While a franchising offers more stability, in the long run it will stifle and suffocate the competitive scene, as it only offers opportunities for good individual players to be picked up by orgs. 

In CS:GO you have tournaments with open qualifiers, which allows for people to have a chance to make a name for themselves *as a team*. In league there is just no opportunities for teams to ever be able to make it to pro because you would have to buy in, or magically get picked up by an org that drops their whole roster (never gonna happen).

The last thing I want as someone aspiring to go pro in this game is to have to stream everyday and be top 100 to get a chance to get picked up by an org, when I could potentially have a team that could stomp everybody in pro play. They need to have open qualifiers to allow teams to be able to earn their name and oust ""pro"" teams, should they prove themselves better. Look at DotA. OG lost their spot with Fly and s4 leaving so they had to play ceb and pick up topsen and they had to go through open qualifiers for TI8. And then they won. This is what Valorant needs in it's esport scene: open qualifiers that allow a chance for ANYBODY to win the entire thing, because anyone should be able to make a team and compete. 

League of Legends only has two seasons each year, both of which teams are bought into. No new teams. So the only way to get in is to be picked up as a player by one of those teams. So it's hard to go pro, and encourages players to pug rather than learn teamplay elements and form teams to try to qualify for events and go pro. The only tournaments are invite tournaments from the best teams in the aforementioned seasons. Imagine how many good teams we might have right now in the LoL esport scene if there were open qualifiers, because there would be squads of players who develop their team skills together and eventually qualify rather than just pug and stream in hopes of being picked up. The League of Legends esport scene is extremely stale, especially compared to esports such as R6, CS:GO, and DotA, all of which have open qualifiers and more tournaments.

Another thing is fostering team play talent. In CS:GO ESEA has leagues, with divisions Open, Intermediate, Main, Advanced, MDL, and ESL Pro League. These are season based leagues that are always going on every 3 months (with month long breaks in-between) that allow players to get practice in a team and competitive environment that is completely different than the pugging environment. This builds up players and allows them to hone the skills they'll need to perform at the pro level. It also allows an opportunity to make their team professional. FURIA is a team I remember seeing play in Main, and they went 16-0 in season play and 8-0 in playoffs, made MDL, and then Pro League. Now they are a top 30 pro team in CS:GO. ESEA provided an opportunity for a younger org and team to make a name for themselves and enter the pro scene. And of course, in LoL, you don't have leagues like this, so there is no opportunity for players to get competitive experience in team, league, and tournament environments with prize pools, because they only pug. This cannot happen with Valorant if we want a truly healthy esport scene. 

Having open qualifiers for most tournaments and leagues, in addition to franchised leagues is what will make an esport feel truly vibrant and allow it to grow. It offers opportunities for teams and players to actually make a name for themselves and allows for talent to actually get spotted much better, in a way that you don't get in League of Legends. 

So yes, we do need franchising so players don't get exhausted with poor tournament scheduling: *to an extent*. The aforementioned is more important however. I would choose the CS:GO esport scene style with individual tournaments from Dreamhack, ESL, FACEIT, and more any day of the week rather than franchising. 

Please Riot: open qualifiers, more tournaments (*with open qualifiers*), in addition to everything else. FOSTER upcoming talent instead of encouraging orgs to make boring decisions and use players that are already in the system rather than take chances on upcoming talent. Encourage people to make teams and compete for spots in pro, because it encourages orgs to scout out team talent in addition to player talent.",2020-03-02 23:05:26

I knew Riot was planning on doing an Fps for quite some time... so i was just waiting for the confirmation. 

Now here is my insane theory that i sculpted out of the best weed one can find. If you play a regular game of Counter Strike, you call your mates and say : Hey, lets go play some Cs... Now Valorants short ""name"" will be ""Vr""!

Maybe this is very off but I strongly believe, especially because they focus on performance (a 10 year old Pc can run Valorant with 30 fps) that this game is going for Virtual reality.  This would be an ""extra"" thing for obv reasons and the main focus will be on mouse and keyboard... But Riot cant give that name with no reason .... they do everything for a reason and I believe to have found this one.

VALORANT,2020,3,"@HenryGcsgo on Twitter

&gt;I didn't get a chance to play every single character in great depth. From what I gathered. It's a hanzo like arrow that shows intel for a few seconds but can also be destroyed before info is given up. I will have to report on that properly later down the line.

VALORANT,2020,3,"Was taking a look at sources posted online about abilities of the Agents that we'll get to play from the trailers &amp; game play of content creators that have shared information.

Some things to note about an Agent's kite is that they have two core abilities; a Signature and an Ultimate ability. These two are separate from the shop economy. Ultimate Abilities will always go by a Point System- the most common case I've seen of gaining these points is through kills, but the maps seem to have orbs throughout it and will most likely assist in this matter. As for Signature Abilities we have examples of Cooldown (Sage as an example), Point System, and Unique (Viper and Brimstone). Shop abilities seem to allow players to purchase up to 1-3 in quantity reaching from Agent to Agent.

**Phoenix:** Signature Ability: *Curveball* - A flash bang like ability. This ability uses a Point System and it takes two points to recharge the ability.

Ultimate Ability: *Run it Back* - Choose a location and when you die during the duration you'll be reborn there with full health. From the character breakdown on Polygon it also mentions ""or when this ability's duration expires"" so I'm curious if it also has Tracer like effect. Another factor I'm curious about is if you'll keep your weapons when reborn. This ability uses a Point System and requires 6 in total to gain access to it.

*Hot Hands* - Seems to act like the Molotov but has the addition benefit of healing Phoenix. It'll explode after a delay in the air (assuming) or when it reaches the ground (maybe a wall as well?). This ability is bought through the store (I heard details about ability economy being separate from weapons? Need more information), cost is unknown but you can buy up to two of these.

*Blaze* - A wall of flame will block vision and damage anyone that passes through it. From comments you bend the wall. This ability is bought through the store, cost is unknown but you can buy up one.

**Jett:** Signature Ability: *Tailwind* - A dash that goes into the direction you're moving. This ability uses the Point System and requires two points to recharge.

Ultimate Ability: *Blade Storm* - Gain access to 5 wind daggers. A kill with restores all daggers. Left click is a single while right click throws all remaining daggers. Requires 6(?) points to gain access.

*Cloudburst* - A dense smoke grenade by the looks of it. This ability is bought, cost is unknown but you can buy up to three.

*Updraft* - This ability propels you upwards. This ability is bought, cost is unknown but you can buy up to two.

**Viper:** Signature Ability: *Toxic Screen* - A line of gas emits from chosen location. Didn't see enough videos to see if the ability is always on the same portion of the map each time, but from a single video the ability was always in the same spot for three rounds. This ability uses Fuel (Unique) and as long as you have Fuel you can reactivate this ability. Blocks visual but players are able to move through it freely- green on mini map shows it is active and blue for inactive.

Ultimate Ability: *Viper's Pit* - Massive toxic cloud in an area. Looks to constantly drain enemies health when inside but doesn't kill- enemies will regain health when outside the pit. Viper can see highlighted enemies when they are inside. Requires 7 points to gain access.

*Snakebite* - Pool of acid, didn't see any video of this so I'm going to guess it is like a Molotov effect. This ability is bought, cost is unknown but you can buy up to two.

*Poison Cloud* - Similar to Jett's Cloudburst but lethal. Apparently this can be picked up and thrown again and always usable as long as Viper has Fuel.

**Sova:** Signature Ability: *Recon Bolt* - Like Hanzo's ability to reveal enemies but has a requirement of Line of Sight to the bolt, apparently it can be destroyed, can bounce, and can shoot over ledges. Didn't see any footage of Sova so unsure if this ability uses the Point System, has a Cooldown, or is Unique.

Ultimate Ability: *Hunter's Fury* - Fires three blasts of energy, didn't see any footage of this one yet. Points required is unknown at the moment.

*Shock Bolt* - Explosive bolt that pluses out static energy. This ability is bought, cost is unknown and the amount you can buy is unknown.

*Owl Drone* - A drone that can fly out for recon and shoot darts to reveal enemies that are hit. This ability is bought, cost is unknown and the amount you can buy is unknown.

*Cypher:** Signature Ability: *Spycam* - Can place a cam around map, and access it similar to Rainbow 6 Siege. Can fire a dart to reveal enemies. Unsure if ability is Point System, Cooldown or Unique.

Ultimate Ability: *Neural Theft* - Gain information from an enemy's corpse to reveal the location of the remaining enemies. Point amount is unknown for access.

*Trapwire* - Stealth tripwire between walls. Triggering it restrains and reveals enemies. This ability is bought, cost &amp; carry amount is unknown.

*Cyber Cage* - A remote trap that slow enemies. This ability is bought, cost &amp; carry amount is unknown.

**Brimstone:** Signature Ability: *Sky Smoke* a global smokescreen similar to Cloudburst. Can access any point of the map and even indoors it seems (unsure). You can have up to three of these but the way to gain them is unknown- the spot that shows Point System or Cooldown indicators doesn't float around that ability.

Ultimate Ability: *Orbital Strike* - Choose a location on the map and launch (missles?) to that location. Requires 6 points to gain access.

*Incendiary* -  Unsure if this is like the Molotov as well but apparently it can damage allies and enemies. This ability is bought, cost is unknown but you can buy up to one.

*Stim Beacon* - A beacon that gives Rapid fire to nearby players. Some posts online say select a location but some footage shows Brimstone throwing the Beacon. Rapid fire buff is unknown but I'd imagine it's straightforward considering its name. This ability is bought, cost is unknown but you can buy up to two.

**Sage:** Signature Ability: *Healing Orb* - Heal yourself or throw an orb to an ally to heal to full(?) health over five seconds. This ability has a Cooldown of 35 seconds.

Ultimate Ability: *Resurrection* - Revives an ally. Channel time is unknown, based on very early alpha footage it is shorter then Healing Orb duration but I bet that has changed. Points required is 7 to gain access.

*Slow Orb* - Creates a field on the ground that slows players and increase their noise when moving on it. This ability is bought, cost is unknown but you can buy up to two.

*Barrier Orb* - An ice wall that can be broken through (in sections from early footage). This ability is bought, cost is unknown but you can buy up to one.

Stuff is unknown about this Agent but I'll include his basic information.

**Omen:** Signature Ability: *Dark Cover* - I imagine this is like Cloudburst but distance can be increased by charging it (holding left click I'd imagine).

Ultimate Ability: *From the Shadows* - If you're familiar with League of Legends I'd compare this very much to Twisted Fate mixed with Reaper from Overwatch. From Polygon it's quoted as this: "" Select anywhere on the map to teleport and reform. When arriving, appear as a Shade, that will go back to your original location if killed. Once the teleport is complete, become Incorporeal for a short time.""

*Paranoia* - A straight line shadow that causes nearsightedness to anyone that touches it. 

*Shadow Walk* - Teleport a short distance, similar to Reaper from Overwatch I'd imagine since you materialize. 


I hope some of this brings more information about the Agents, especially their core abilities that separate from the shop economy. There seems to be a design choice of scouting information (Sova and Cypher), area denial, or a terms of smoke grenades in the Agents. I'm curious how players will look to build their teams to fill requires based on maps or abilities needed to gain the edge.",2020-03-03 03:29:21

VALORANT,2020,3,"I'll be trying to make an organized guide to everything we saw in the recent gameplay previews, as well as a guide to each character's kit and some other gameplay basics.

&amp;#x200B;

*Match Format*

5v5 Best of 25 Rounds (1:40 combat per round)

A transparent, indestructible barrier is present for 30 seconds at the beginning of each round.

Bomb plant removes the timer from the HUD, though it lasts 45 seconds until detonation. (After defusing, the timer re-appears on the HUD to show how much time was left as the defuse finished.)

&amp;#x200B;

*Abilities*

4 Abilities per character

2 **Standard Abilities** which must be bought with the same currency as weapons

1 **Signature Ability** which is given for free at the start of each round

1 **Ultimate Ability** which charges in two ways:

1. Getting a specific number of kills (The number varies for each ability)
2. Picking up an orb at certain points of the map (Currently unsure of how many kills the orb is equivalent to)

&amp;#x200B;

*Health*

100 base health

Up to 50 shield can be purchased. Important to note that in gunfights, your shield only mitigates incoming damage. You will still take HP damage with a shield active, it will just be less HP damage.

VALORANT,2020,3,"It's not massively exciting on paper, but will be a massive success because the design choices they are choosing are solely focused on what worked for other games in eSports.  This foundation, and ftp will propell the game.

It's out in a few months, no time for any major changes.  Counter-Strike with Heroes and Fortnite graphics is exactly what you would expect the next evolution to look like.",2020-03-03 10:00:59

VALORANT,2020,3,"*Classick answered a ton of questions on the Gameplay-Discussion channel in the official Valorant discord. Here are most of the questions and answers.*

------------------

**@Classick: My official title is lead game designer, per relevance to this channel I worked on many of the weapons for the game.**

&gt;Whats the name for the ""Champions"" do we call them agents? or Heroes?

**Agents**

&gt;Do weapons have recoil? 

**The weapons have recoil, bloom/spread/error, and most can use ADS as well (as shown in the vid)**

&gt; I'm assuming whilst you move and shoot the recoil is increased as you are moving?

**ya**

&gt;Is there movement inaccuracy ?

**Different gun types have different movement accuracy**

&gt;Any news on spray patterns vs recoil? 

**I was thinking about doing a more in-depth write up for this one, I'll work on that.**

&gt;Does shooting with weapons cause camera shake?

**As shown in the video, yes**

&gt;Are abilities affected by recoil and running?

**It's dependent on the ability. As shown in the video, one of the primary strengths of the Kunai is that you can use it accurately on the move.**

&gt;Can we shoot through walls? 

**Yes there's wall-pen, but we use a system to prevent egregious stuff like cross-map pen through lots of walls etc.**

&gt;What about penetration? shooting through two people?

**yea same idea**

&gt;Do weapons have different reload speeds/sounds?

**Each weapon has a unique reload time, with sound broadcast**.

&gt;Can we ricochet abilities for more tactical use?

**This is probably better for \#agent-discussion** [*note: this is a Discord channel*] **, but abilities are intended to have tactical uses. So that means delivery methods that don't require direct line of sight on your opponent.**

 &gt;I don't think this should be asked here, but it's still a mechanic for shooting so, is there leaning in the game?

 **No leaning**

&gt;1 bullet headshot kills on most guns?

**There are 1 bullet headshots, not for all guns though.**

&gt;Customizable crosshairs or fixed depending the gun?

**You can customize your crosshair, in the video reveal you can see different settings.**


&gt;Do characters heal over time if not damaged?

**No that's Agent abilities that are providing healing**

&gt;Anyone knows if all signature abilities have cooldowns? or it is only for some agents and for others it is single use?

**Signature effects are unique per character**

&gt;During the use of abilities, the character seems to be unarmed. Will there be a delay to take the weapon back in hands?

**It's intentional that using your agent abilities over your weapon is an intentional choice and will take commitment. Knowing when to have your gun out versus your abilities is important.**


&gt;Whats your favorite agent?

**I'd have to say my favorite is Omen, followed up by Brimstone.**

&gt;does brimstones stimpack work during pistol round

**This ability works on all rounds!**


&gt;Is there bunny hop in Valorant?

**We'd like movement to be expressive in Valorant, letting players pull off trick jumps etc. We don't intend on players moving around the map at huge speeds though.**
 

&gt;Will there be pistol rounds, or can players buy bigger guns right at the start?

**You have a set of money on first round that sets what you can purchase.**


&gt; When we saw the money economy when the guy had around 5k and the next round the minimal income was of 7.4k. He gets the 2.4k right?

**This means minimum possible income for that round. So you don't acquire money from any other action, die/lose round.**

&gt;What's the philosophy behind the roles of the different guns in the economy? Are cheaper guns used for economy reasons (like CS), or are you aiming to have the guns be more situational/player preference (more of a CoD sort of approach)?

**Ideally a mixture of both, economic status it will inform different gun choices. Also, the set of weapons at each economic range give you options based on playstyle/situation/Agent synergy etc.**

&gt;Is the guardian intended to be a viable primary alternative (like the ak/m4 in CS) to the other rifles? Or more of a situational weapon? And does it 2 or 3 shot to the body? Also, I noticed there is a crosshair when hipfiring the Operator, is hipfiring accurate with this and presumably the other sniper?

**It's another rifle option that will be based on playstyle preference. It's in a similar price range to compete with other rifles. Shots to body depends on armor. Hipfire on operator has some spread but not reflected in the video due to the player's crosshair settings.**

&gt;Are there any plans on patches after the game releases. (Every 2 weeks a patch like league)?

**We plan to operate as a live service, making updates to the game. The cadence for those updates has not yet been defined.**

&gt;Will there be multiple game modes at release or only the bomb plant scenario?

**Exploration of additional modes is definitely a consideration, but we're focusing efforts on the core mode at the moment.**

&gt;Will all maps have 3 bomb plants?

**Each map has unique elements, 3 sites is unique addition for this map.**

&gt;What is the server tick rate?

**128 tick, as mentioned in some articles that just released.**

&gt;Since there is no global utility, I think this quite promotes maining/onetricking. How will Valorant go around this? Can you have multiple of one character in a team? Can you queue as a character and a 2nd character like queuing as a role in league?

**We'll see as the game progresses, we have our own theories but open to see how people play and we'll make any adjustments as necessary.**


&gt;Any colorblind options planned?

**Yes, we definitely want to support options  for colorblind spectrums. In progress.**

&gt;How is Valorant linked to League of Legends? Is it even in the same universe?

**Different IP**

&gt;Why [did you guys make] the decision of making every character the same hitbox/health? Doesn't this limit development?

**This deserves a long answer, I'll write something up for later. Simple answer is we've focused on tight, lethal tactical gameplay. Changing hp or hitbox has significant impact on gameplay and we want agents to be chosen for their toolkits, not passive stats like this.**

&gt;Will there be any singleplayer storymode for characters to develop them?

**No singleplayer, but we're interested in further agent development through other methods over time**.

&gt;Utility wise are the skyboxes really capped or you can throw skills everywhere?

**The sky is the limit**

&gt;Will abilities be crucial for the game? 

**We want abilities and gunplay to complement each other. So they'll both be important for success.**

&gt;Ok imma ask a big question can we have a ingame sensitivity converter from other games like cs etc.?

**We'll make sure to provide some conversions for sensitivity from other popular titles**

&gt;Is the art style going to be upgraded/polished as we progress through Patches/Seasons just like in League of Legends?

**Of course, we'll always be looking to improve the game. This is why we really appreciate feedback and suggestions to improve the game as we go into live service.**

&gt;are there plans of having weapon cosmetics ?

 **Sorry not ready to answer this yet!**

&gt;[Is it] gonna be capped 144 hz?

 **Not capped at 144 hz, you can run the game at whatever refresh rate your computer handles.**

&gt;Will there be a ""reconnect"" feature at launch?

**Yeah when you disconnect you'll be able to return**

&gt;How many years ago did you start developing VALORANT? 

**~6 years total, 3 years R&amp;D, 3 years pre-production/production**

VALORANT,2020,3,"For people not from ME, CSGO is one of the largest played games in PC. CSGO, LoL, OW, and Dota 2 (not in that order) is dominating the PC gaming landscape in the ME (Specifically GCC). Valorant has a shit ton of things ME players will like. Plz do an ME server.",2020-03-03 11:48:43
VALORANT,2020,3,What does Valorant mean? It is simply because of Valoran in Runeterra?,2020-03-03 12:06:41
VALORANT,2020,3,One thing about I worry is too many update in game meta. It works in LOL but VALORAN is FPS not MOBA. In this type of games it don't works. In CS:GO we didn't have too many changes and it was ok. I'm not including AUG and KRIEG prize changes. Many Major changes was not really good. For example when Valve added Revolver to game it was too OP. Now this gun is useless. So I'm worry about this kind of situations.,2020-03-03 12:09:52
VALORANT,2020,3,"As a CS player who has been on stretched resolution (no black bars) as long as I can remember, does anyone know if full screen stretched will be allowed in Valorant? I know the rumor is no, but any concrete information? Want to know if I should start getting used to 16:9.",2020-03-03 12:17:52
VALORANT,2020,3,"I'll have initial excitement, log in, knock out whatever tutorial it throws at me, grimacing as I miss the non moving dummy. 

Me and a freind will hop into a casual game, full of hope and ""wow so cools"", and as my freind does ok, I will have 0 kills.

Fast forward a week of multiple games a day, and here it is my big moment. By the will of the gods, I manage to keep my mouse on someone that's been peppered by bullets and kill em. Deep down I know, but deny, this will be my 1 kill.

The next 2 weeks will be fate harassing me, as I get hits but know kills, going negative every game.

The last few days of the month will consist of me turning corners getting instantly blasted. I will end a month of gaming with a single kill and hate in my heart.

I'm still probably gonna play it the next month anyways. This is taken from multiple attempts at playing shooters with Mouse and Keyboard, like Siege, CSGO, Overwatch, Ect.

Either way, still hype.",2020-03-03 12:18:23

VALORANT,2020,3,"Do you think lower end cpus can get similar results on low settings? 

**Low settings will help for sure, but getting 144 on a potato depends on your potato graphically, we're trying to hit low/med/high settings according to the min/medium/high specs, so when we say our min spec runs at 30 fps it's on low**

Hey, Mochi, what's your load type look like? Will players benefit from SSD's and [NV.ME](https://NV.ME) M.2 Drives?

**This is changing day by day and by machine. you definitely benefit from SSDs vs HDDs in things like load times and texture streaming times, but like in all games, SATA SSD vs NVMe isn't as big a difference as say copying files**

Was viper ult the textures and graphics of it a placeholder cuz it looked so weird in the video?

**Alpha footage, may change or may not change, i'm actually not sure about the viper one in particular**

Are the abilities overused in the trailer to show them in a short time or is this the (normal) use of abilities ?

**The trailer had a lot of abilities and ultimate abilities used, which is more typical of a late-round high-economy**

Can we know if there are weapon skins?

VALORANT,2020,3,"I know it's not even beta phase and this is not League but I want to get this out there as soon as possible and the game is still made by Riot Games.

In League, players get to flex they are ""good"" with one champion by showing off the mastery level of one champion, which honestly has become an obnoxious behaviour where players spam the damn mastery banner on players faces, making a torturing visual and noise for even that players' teammates. 

This time around you could have cosmetics being a part of that. Reward players with a new jacket or even just a color variation of that jacket (jacket as an example) or a new hairstyle, helmet variation, etc. And as for as the weapons just as much. A color variation like gold and silver.

When it comes to weapons, actually, developers could even go as far as different triggers, magazines, bullets, a blood-written sentence after killing an enemy (which can be a character reward as well) and still not hurt the skin driven economy which Valorant will most definetly have since it's a Free to Play and Riot game.

Hopefully everyone feels as I do and this reaches to developers. Maybe this will already be implemented, jus trying to make sure it does.",2020-03-03 13:08:52

VALORANT,2020,3,"Am I the only one that thinks this? I'll start off by saying that I like what I'm seeing from the game so far for the most part, but I felt that Riot could've made a better gameplay preview. Although the game is in alpha and everything is subject to change, the first impressions that viewers get from gameplay are very important. I'll list some things that I like about the preview and some things that could've improved it.

\*\*Liked:\*\*

\- Unscripted gameplay. It's nice hearing people talk and strategize naturally like how players like you and me probably would. No cringy acting and reading off a script like a robot

\- Demonstrations of how the abilities are used.

After watching the preview again multiple times... that's about it.

\*\*Improvements:\*\*

\- Longer gameplay time. I felt that the gameplay we were given was too short, I think a longer gameplay preview (around maybe 10-20 mins) would have given viewers more insight on economy, gunplay, game pace, and ability usage frequency.

\- Explanation of gameplay. This doesn't necessarily mean the gameplay has but be scripted but it'd be nice to have a narrator of some sort explaining what's going on, character abilities, etc.

\- Too many abilities shown. I think this is what potentially turn a lot of plays off when first watching the preview, they were clearly focused on showing the abilities off based but didn't balance it with enough gunplay. This gives some viewers the impression that abilities are spammed and that they're more impactful than they really are.

I had to view other content and text to get an idea of what the game is actually like which made me more hyped than viewing the preview because I didn't really get anything from it. Something like this is what the preview should have been like: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muFpmz-LVAk&amp;t=865s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muFpmz-LVAk&amp;t=865s)

From what we have seen from the gameplays, it seems like abillities will be picked with a button and then used with left/right mouse click, same as nades in CS.

Will there be similar ""inventory scrolling"" system as in CS? Even tho it is and never will be fastest option, for a lot players like me it's only way to play-

VALORANT,2020,3,"I’m curious because I feel like, while a lot of people coming from Overwatch will be expecting really high quality cosmetics, as a much more tactical shooter than that or Paladins or other hero shooters, making skins for these characters might make it more difficult to quickly identify what enemy hero you’re suddenly facing off against in a given location and what abilities you’re about to have to face.
This might be especially worrying bc of how quick time to kill is in this game.
Now, of course, you’ll know what abilities might be up each round and you can plan around that and in watching the gameplay video it seems like most abilities are either channeled or buffered which means there shouldn’t be a lot of abilities that threaten more than a gun would in a sudden encounter which should also make skins matter less.

VALORANT,2020,3,"So far from what I've seen, I think I probably going to pick up a mobility character like Jett. The fast movement and outplaying the enemy with quick dashes and surprising bursts threw smokes sounds like to much fun.  I honestly can't wait for this game!",2020-03-04 01:33:54

VALORANT,2020,3,PashaBiceps during tests didn't use abilities and he had 29 kills in one match. So abilities have impact in game but if you have problem with them but you have good AIM it won't be problem for you,2020-03-04 11:31:21
VALORANT,2020,3,"In physically demanding sports with rich history (boxing for example), knowledge is transferred from someone like a trainer or coach. The people who are being coached are getting a much quicker understanding of what is important and get to a much higher level of skill in a shorter amount of time. Letting people train on their own often leads to a much poorer skill LvL compared to someone trained.

Back when I started to play CSGO, I missed a feature guiding me through the fundamentals. Of course you will get the hang of it at some point but the worst players would play a lot better if they knew what they are doing wrong. 

Especially with a very competitive eSports driven game like Valorant fundamentals are very important!

A probable solution for this would be a training map or/and match that tells the player how to react in certain situations. For example:

- Don't overextend 
- stay Def in after plant situations
- refrag 
- abilities and where/when to use them
- spray patterns
- movement like strafing around corners or standing still while shooting
-  effective range for weapons like SMG's or sniper rifles
-  etc. etc.

This may only include a small portion of what is good to know when playing in a competitive round based fps. And maybe I'm even wrong about all of the points stated above, but creating an environment that makes everyone in it a much better player and increasing the skill ceiling much faster by doing so, can only lead to a much more enjoyable playing experience for everyone. :)",2020-03-04 12:02:30

I can't think of any game that gave me so many chills as League of Legends. Fast paced mechanics, character designs, lores and CINEMATICS. League players would always have memories such as ""You remember our unbeatable Braum &amp; Ezreal duo? We were sick man.""

And now this. Valorant! You, people, just blew my mind. As a CS:GO player I always wished for a CS level lethality shooter, but with more tactical varieties than CS:GO. Can't wait for the release.

VALORANT,2020,3,"I quit my career in CS:GO while being a master guardian, which means that I wasn't that great, that's pretty much the point when the game starts to get serious, and you will either quit or marry it. The barrier I couldn't get through was finding the time needed to practice smoking by aimig at the right pixel of the cloud, a very specific amounts of pixels to the left from the electric wire, while standing on the right corner of the box, an exact step to the right from the wooden pole. 

Smoking is a key factor of CS:GO and that game wouldn't work without it, but if we're getting a new product designed from the grounds up, then I hope that this interaction can be improved upon by making it clearer and less time consuming. Smoking isn't an earned skill. It's just something you have to memorize in multiple spots per map, which takes an hour or two of mindlessly screwing around on an empty level once per map, after every time you take a longer break or the map gets any kind of a major overhaul. It's the equivalent of memorizing the multiplication table. You got to know it if you want to get anything done, but neither learning it nor having learnt it feels in any way satisfactory.

I'd like to play Valorant. Please focus on making a game where playing is what we spend time on, not prepping, not printing reference sheets, but interacting with the enemy in an amazing game of cat and mouse. Don't let mechanics spiral out of control out from tradition.",2020-03-04 16:33:11

-Gunplay is the main focus, spells and all that bullshit aren't as important and if you're bad, will not give you any advantage over a player with good mechanics. (It's like utility in CS)

If it were only for damage, sure, that makes sense, you'd know which direction you got shot from, but any kind of foresight for interactions you can't just hear or see in front of you is too much.",2020-03-05 18:31:54

VALORANT,2020,3,"I see many people want to be able to play this game on 4:3 stretched or black bars, why? I play cs:go on 4:3 and I HATE it but I HAVE to because it gives me an advantage when I aim for the head. Why are you want the same thing to be available on Valorant? I cannot understand it, this is 2020 for god's sake. Let's just play the game on 16:9 so we don't suffer from the narrow, blurry, ugly sight of 4:3. Sure people will say ""Then go play on 16:9, no one's forcing you to play on 4:3"". You are wrong, 4:3 players are forcing me to play on 4:3 because it gives free advantage when aiming. Sure it has it's downsides like decreased FOV and faster targets but who cares when oppenent's head is as big as a watermelon.

VALORANT,2020,3,Valorant - NEW PHOENIX TRAILER | Gameplay Details Discussion,2020-03-06 00:10:15
VALORANT,2020,3,"I remember being ten years old and download a shit ton of mods for 1.6, like super heroes abilities like super man, wolverine and shit, or one that changed the game completely into dragon ball z where you could do tons of things.

And always said things like wow this games needs a sequel with powers and other type of things.

But condition zero and source were more like a remaster than an actual sequel, and csgo, even though it has tons good additions it still feels like the only thing separating it from 1.6 is their qol changes instead of a sequel.

I don't know, maybe that's what they aimed for and I can't blame them, why bother fixing something that is not broken.

What this game seems to be, at least for me, a true sequel of 1.6 in all its glory and I can't wait to play it.

All the news about this game are interesting, good tickrate, anti cheat system day one, the gameplay looks fun and some places reminds me of dust2 and inferno my potato pc is able to run it.

VALORANT,2020,3,"I might be reaching here since abilities and such are subject to change but here's something i have been thinking about after looking at the characters and their abilities that we know of right now:  


*  There are 3 characters with abilities that i have seen being picked a lot in other games. These abilities include ability to resurrect, see through walls and global teleport so i am talking about Sage, Sova and Omen.  

*  If their abilities work the way i am thinking they'll have one of the highest pick rates and or ban rates soon after if banning is going to be a thing.  

*  Excluding the random matchmaking if a team queues with a plan i am sure they'll have one or more of the above characters with a choice between Sova and Cypher.  

*  And as we know once the pick rates go up a nerf always follow. So yeah some of those characters might be among the first to be balanced.  


I would like to know your thoughts on this and add to it or if you think this wont be the case i would like to hear what you have in mind.

Therefore what type of implementation would you prefer? Personally I'd like Valorants' own version of Leagues role select where instead you pick 2-3 characters you are OPEN to playing.

Pros:   
Possibility of playing your chosen character(s)  
Faster queues over a single-pick variant  
Less game dodging  
etc

Cons:   
No one tricking  
Possibility of game dodging if your first chosen picks are taken

VALORANT,2020,3,"In “The Round” Footage we see the Sova at a total of 4900 Cash, we see him buy the Vandal and Heavy Shields which brings him down to 1000 total cash, assuming he’s already bought abilities or didn’t buy any at all. 

  
The total cost is 3900 – So can assume one of two things the Vandal cannot be cheaper than the Phantom at 2900.

  
We go up in price at easy 100s meaning that the vandal can cost anywhere between 3000 – 3800  
We can assume that heavy shields will be more expensive than light shields at 400. This now means that the Vandal can now cost anywhere between 3000 – 3400. Speculation time, an easy plus 25 shields are double the health, so let’s say double the price taking Heavy Shields to 800 in price and the Vandal to 3100.  

  
This makes a lot of sense because both the Vandal and Phantom have very distinct weaknesses and strengths. Phantom outperforming at closer ranges with its higher fire rate at 11/s (no zoom) than Vandals lower fire rate 9.25/s (no zoom) However because the Vandal doesn’t have damage drop off it outperforms the Phantom at longer ranges. Sort of how the AK and the M4 operate in CS.

The footage we’ve seen currently have shown a few maps where they are mainly only holding close angles where you’d be much better off both economically and in raw DPS selecting the Phantom over the Vandal. This is interesting to me because one of the main issues in terms of guns in CS is there are a lot of weapons that are simply never utilised, which brings me to my final point.   

  
I am HOPING that in Valorant with universal gun usage on both sides that there is a conscious effort that maps will determine what type of weapons you’ll want to bring with you. In the example I’ve given, playing a map with a long-range counterpart such as Dust 2 long you’d want to be packing Operators and Vandals over Judges and Phantoms.  

  
If you’ve got this far thanks for reading.

VALORANT,2020,3,"I've watched again all of the footage we got so far to see what other minor details we have missed [Like pinging weapons around you]  
**Reminder:** Some of these are my assumptions based on what I see q.q  
---  
**[The Round - Valorant Gameplay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8amyzDHOKw)**  
  
- Right at the start, in the top right corner there is a symbol ""Low Server FPS"" that looks like a notification. League of Legends has a similar type of Notification system [although not in-game], where you would have Green/Yellow/Red exclamation symbol to indicate severity of the issue.. for example: Red Symbol - Champion is disabled due to a bug  
- Player names are stated below agent models  
- You can easily review teammate weapons/armor by looking at the items above them while Buy phase is active  
- Teammates and Enemies that have Ultimate ability unlocked will have Yellow stripe shown above their icon on the display bar that shows players who are alive at the moment  
- You can change the position of the radar, enlarge/shrink it.. as well as crop it? So, technically you can zoom-in radar and crop it to a small circle [..to be able to see nothing at all lol] or have it zoomed out and kept in a larger circle to see everything  
- To add to the point above, if your teammate is outside of your radar circle, they will be indicated with arrow pointing towards their direction as seen at ~[0:37](https://youtu.be/g8amyzDHOKw?t=37)  
- The radar can display your teammates and your current vision direction. It will also show if the vision is obscured by objects but not by the abilities(?) [smoke wall/bomb]. Also, on some parts of the video it is not showing up so I guess it can be disabled [Brimstone/Player with the sniper.. has it enabled but the rest of them don't?]  
- At [0:40](https://youtu.be/g8amyzDHOKw?t=40) Phoenix is capturing an ability point and gets his Ultimate unlocked [Yellow stripe shows up on the info bar mentioned above]. Is this unique to the specific map or what.. I only remember getting ability points on kills or after dying    
- At [1:35](https://youtu.be/g8amyzDHOKw?t=95) we can see the note about being spectated at top right. Kinda strange to see this is overwritten by kill-info  
- At [1:33](https://youtu.be/g8amyzDHOKw?t=93) we can see status effect ""DECAY"" that gradually lowers Brimstones HP but once he gets into contact with the toxic liquid over the ground it seems like he lost a flat amount of both Armor and HP over like ~2s that stacked(?) with the previous HP loss.. almost killing him. Once he left the cloud, he regained majority of HP and I assume that the missing 91/100 HP is due to the toxic liquid and not decay  
- There is a range indicator for distance between you and the body of a teammate who got killed. Not sure why exactly because body is already highlighted  
- There is a small multi-kill indicator on the kill-info, shows up as roman number III once Viper kills Jett  
- At [2:06](https://youtu.be/g8amyzDHOKw?t=126) status effect ""COMBAT STIM"" that was earlier deployed by Brimstone. There is also visual indicator on the sides of the screen [upwards moving arrows]  
- Important to notice - it seems that ""DECAY"" can not kill you as seen at the end of the video, [~2:06](https://youtu.be/g8amyzDHOKw?t=129). HP Reached 0 and there was a sound effect to indicate it?  
- To add to the above, it seems that these types of effects [Decay, Combat Stim] gradually fall off and that is shown by the indicator [that loading circle(?)] [At [2:10](https://youtu.be/g8amyzDHOKw?t=133) the player lost ""COMBAT STIM"" but instantly regain ""DECAY"" after entering Vipers ult  
- At [2:20](https://youtu.be/g8amyzDHOKw?t=140) we can see that dropped weapons have white glow/beam.. something like in Borderlands  
  
---
  
[Phoenix Gameplay video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXluDCRqM-s)  
  
- As mentioned earlier, roman numbers to indicate kill streak [III and IV] appears on the kill status just besides the Agent icon  
- Announcer indicates ""One enemy remaining"" at [0:12](https://youtu.be/xXluDCRqM-s?t=12)  
- Announcer shouts ""CLUTCH"" as the round ends! There is also a visual representation of it.. with an effect of broken glass and writing ""CLUTCH' on the middle of screen. It can barely be seen at the end of the video

[Project A: Riot's Tactical FPS Announcement (Early Alpha footage)](https://youtu.be/4iGU6PctOBg?t=131)  
  
- Just wanted to note that the person playing the game at [2:11](https://youtu.be/4iGU6PctOBg?t=131) seems to have some kind of a really-long knife compared to the one we see in the footage today. Just saying.. it could be out there :P

[VALORANT EXCLUSIVE New Gameplay!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muFpmz-LVAk)  
  
- At [11:34](https://youtu.be/muFpmz-LVAk?t=694) the indicator that points towards enemies [the one going around your crosshair] seems to grow in size the more enemies there is. It actually looks like multiple individual indicators are overlapping?  
- At the same time you can see a tip for switching spectate on the bottom-left..

VALORANT,2020,3,"I see a lot of questions asking if valorant is coming to console and with the available information, I don't think it will. So I put together a very budget PC build that can should be able to run valorant at 144+ fps. 

https://pcpartpicker.com/list/DDGpDx

some notes:

- prices are for readily available parts, you can certainly get them cheaper if you wait for sales/rebates etc. 

- no monitor, 1080p 144hz should cost an additional $120-$150 but I think you can find them at a cheaper price. I got my ASUS VG248QE several years ago for only $100 (used).

- only 8gb of ram but 8gb more can be added down the line. 

- I suggest getting a gtx 1060 6gb instead if you want to run other games at 144+ fps as well, as valorant has a low system requirements.

VALORANT,2020,3,Confirmed by a Spanish YouTuber who play-tested the game in Berlin last January.,2020-03-08 12:31:04
VALORANT,2020,3,"I would love to hear from the devs if they played the old cs 1.6 warcraft/heroes mods and if the devs were inspired by these mods.

Some of the warcraft modded servers were quite similar.

Typical Cs gameplay 5v5/10v10+ bomb + heroes you could chose with 3 abilitys and one ultimate.
On some servers you could buy or even upgrade those abilitys.
Even abilitys of some servers were very similar to Valorant abilitys.

Personally I love those modded servers and I think Valorant will be a huge sucess , Cs gameplay + abilitys offers great gameplay, if the abilitys are not to overpowered.",2020-03-08 13:41:19
VALORANT,2020,3,"&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/g197ni0chgl41.png?width=439&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ab91bd8b99c3dc8f2a59427cb6619616b172cb06

I think a lot of people are really overlooking a very significant factor with Jett's ultimate and its impact on the game's economy. I would not be surprised to see Jett being a ""must pick"" in competitive play for this reason alone: money.

For those of you who have not played or watched CSGO, when I say the economy, I mean your team's total money in-game. When a team chooses not to spend their money so that they can buy stronger weapons the next round, this is called an Eco-Round. It's a short term risk, long term reward situation, with the downside being that some or all of your players will have to suffer through a round with only pistols. Other times, you might funnel money into getting one player a very powerful item (such as an AWP), at the expense of others.

But then there's Jett. From the footage shown so far of Valorant's gameplay, and testimonials from playtesters, it seems as though you can expect to get your ultimate about once every 3-4 rounds or so. This means that in a 30 round match (standard CSGO competitive format), you could potentially get Jett's ultimate 10 times.

Every time you do, you're able to equip a weapon (her knives) for free which is comparable if not better than most of the top tier weapons in the game, killing on headshot and two-tapping on body, firing while moving without accuracy loss, and refilling on a kill. And because every time Jett gets her ultimate she doesn't need a weapon, she can either Eco or buy a weapon for her teammate without any consequences.

So just how much money is Jett's ultimate worth? The fire rate and damage are excellent, and the ability to throw knives while moving is impossible to put a pricetag on because it doesn't seem like that exists in any gun. For the sake of comparison, we'll say it's something like 3000, although this is even a bit of a lowball; if Jett's ultimate was in the store for anyone to buy, it could easily be priced much higher and players would still buy it.

So in conclusion, over the course of a 30 round game, Jett can potentially produce 30,000 credits with her ultimate, enough to buy almost 7 of Valorant's ""AWP."" On the low end.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: Jett prints money and will be mandatory in competitive just to bolster her team's economy way past their opponents.",2020-03-08 14:05:17

VALORANT,2020,3,"I have seen a lot of players starting to play CSGO in preparation of Valorant, so I figured I would compile some resources to help you learn the game. 

**BRAND NEW PLAYERS:**
If you have never played CSGO before, you should use the following resources to help understand fundamental mechanics, Valorant seems to be extremely similar in mechanics. I would watch as much War Owl as you can when you are learning, and when you think you have a decent grasp on the movement and other mechanics of CSGO you should move on to other resources. 

**TheWarOwl:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdPBKFV1840

War Owl has been a pillar in the CS community, and you will see people meme him because he makes content designed for brand new players, but the odds are most people you meet in CSGO probably learned how to play from his videos. Check out his videos on Crosshair placement, movement, spray control, etc. 

**LuckySkillFaker:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKNw7sLPNWQ&amp;list=PLfIyu2flKmBCTgQdmDH0fiZUaagB4rD0_&amp;index=1

He has a series in a playlist titled ""CS:GO Noob to Pro"" and I would recommend watching all of them to understand the game. 

**INTERMEDIATE GUDIES:**

**Voo:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gd5PCej5A8o

Voo has some very good content aimed at players who have basic mechanics down (Controls, how to move, etc.) and explains in more detail why you should do some things, and explains some mechanics that a brand new player might struggle with, but a player who has been playing longer might start to grasp. 

I don't know of any better intermediate level content creators than Voo, because most channels aim to hit beginners, or players playing at a competitive level and with a team. 

**EXPERT/ADVANCED GUIDES:**
This is the section I have most experience with, because I have been playing CSGO for 4 years now, and still watch these regularly, and try to learn new things to bring to my team. 

**Steel/Josh Nissan:** Notorious CSGO player, banned from Valve sanctioned events for throwing a match in 2015 with his team iBP(iBUYPOWER), but was unbanned in recent years from ESL events, Dreamhack, ECS, etc. Still playing competitively, and made some absolute bangers for people looking to start playing in a team and up their game. I'm going to compile a short list of videos I would recommend every CSGO player above DMG watch. 

Consistency: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YR2RF_WjwIk

IGL Series(Playlist): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eF7PWimNyjQ&amp;list=PLQcRYyog5iq4sETyxrA1TZcs59Vn5_M7-

I would recommend that before anybody decides to join or start a team to play competitively, you watch every video in that IGL series. 

Roles in CSGO: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=358vBMqdf54

Grenade management: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RIESVj6g0Ng

**Fallen:** IGL for MIBR, SK, Luminosity. Legendary IGL and AWPer, and father of Brazilian Counterstrike that will forever be a historic figure in the CSGO community. The video is quite long, but worth it if you want to start a team. 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdKq1j5L8AY

**Elmapuddy:** Absolute braniac analyst and current coach of Gen.G. Makes consistent bangers, every single video this guy has made is top tier, and highly informative. I can't recommend any one video, but if you want to seriously improve in your team, watch his channel. 

https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBKXQ-XSihIdD5Xh82F8MpA

**SPECIFIC HELP:**

There are a couple of pros who have made videos on specific subjects that I don't particularly think belong in any one category, so I'll just link them here. 

**Autimatic spray control:** 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9khWC8Asz8Y

**n0thing(various):**

**Stewie2k(Various map specific):**

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFoqJuh62Nc

VALORANT,2020,3,"I know a lot of people are complaining about the looks of the game, saying it looks ""too childish"" or ""like a game from 10 years ago"" or ""a mobile game"", and honestly I can see why, though I think the biggest change that would make the game look a lot better are shadows. It's fine that it's made with really low system requirements in mind for potato PCs so that more people can play and for better visibility but why not give the option to activate a few improvements if you so desire and your PC is strong enough.

Mainly, from what I've seen so far, characters don't have shadows, maybe they are just turned off in the demos but if they are not implemented at all, I think that's a mistake. Look [here](https://i.gyazo.com/bc400a63407453a7f875e789798a7270.png), I can't see character shadows in any of the gameplay videos so far, and that's what makes character on the map seem ""out of place"", shadows play a huge role in aesthetics and make thing blend in a lot better, hence many people say the characters/maps/themes and weapons don't really fit well with one another, I kinda agree with the weapons parts, would have preferred a more original/futuristic/fantastic design to them, but I guess the skins will fix that.

Also, lighting and reflection, I see there is not much dynamic lighting and no reflections anywhere, for example here with Phoenix using a fireball, no light changes on the ground or on the wall when casting or throwing [it](https://i.gyazo.com/01341c1a99802190bcba43bc130606e8.png) same as with shadows, some reflection of spells and more lighting play with the maps would help a ton, I noticed there is dynamic lighting on the weapons when you move, so why not have that across the entire game? 

Of course all those 3 options can be made with an ON/OFF toggle in the graphics settings for those that prefer a very minimalist look, but I prefer to max out the looks of the game as well as the frames per second, I can handle pretty much any recent game at 2k resolution and 144 FPS so I'm sure more people would like to have the options. :D",2020-03-08 23:24:18

VALORANT,2020,3,"I get that there are people here that are either big fans of Riot for their past game(s) or because they're genuinely convinced from everything they're seeing that the game will be good. I know when you guys see the gameplay being railed on, you go out of your way to defend Riot because of one reason or another. You don't need to defend Riot, it's part of the job they signed up for to get feedback in the form of ridicule or hype. Everyone is entitled to an opinion, and if people dislike the footage shown because of one reason or another, you don't need to go out of your way to defend it, that's their opinion and leave it at that. Let the game speak for itself on release, then we will know exactly how good or bad it is. What if a criticism you were defending from the footage remains in the final release? Now, if someone is going out of their way to spread lies, then that's another thing, you can clarify those lies, however, I think it's best to restrain ourselves from going above and beyond to die on a hill for a game that isn't even out yet. 

The way that I see it is that with all of this hype, and with everyone convincing themselves and everyone they speak to that ""the game will be fine, it will be the next big thing"", it's just setting up everyone for disappointment, no matter how good the product is, living up to the hype built up over the last month or so is impossible for any game imo. So I think we just need to dial is down, stop defending Riot, stop saying things we don't know like ""x and y will be fixed or implemented on release for sure"" so that when the game is actually out, it's not going to be ripped a new one by everyone whose expectations were sky high from all the hype built up by the community, I've seen it time and time again and don't want this to be another in the list, although I frankly doubt my single post on an obscure subreddit in the corner of the internet will do any good.",2020-03-09 10:55:41

VALORANT,2020,3,"Just thought I'd post this cause none of the gameplay analysis videos I've seen mention it -- there is a recharge mechanic for Jett's dash and Phoenix's molotov thing.

In the Round defense video, Jett uses her dash to get to the action. When she gets the first kill, you see one of the two circled X icons above the dash ability get activated. She gets the second, the second x activates, and the game says signature ability activated. So by getting 2 kills, Jett can get her dash back. However you have to have used it already for this to count -- in the Round offense video, this Jett gets the first pistol headshot of the round. But you don't see the X get activated, indicating you have to have the ability unavailable for the kills to count towards a recharge.

In the Phoenix video, you see these two X's above his molotov ability too, implying it works the same way.

In terms of other characters, we see a lack of these X's for Viper, Sova, Brimstone, and Sage. So we know they don't have the kill recharge. Viper's wall can be reactivated once laid down if she has fuel, Sova's sonar and Sage's heal recharge on time, I don't think we know if Brimstone's smoke recharges (could be wrong though). The ability description for Cypher says his camera recharges when picked up or destroyed. We don't know anything regarding this about Omen, if I had to wager though I'd guess it was a kill-recharge for his shadow thing.",2020-03-10 01:12:47

VALORANT,2020,3,"This week I released a video, which I also posted on Reddit, regarding progression in Valorant. My friend who I work with on the channel, Sven, reported that at the Riot offices he got told about and saw URF/NERF skins.

Riot has contacted me since and says that they are not planning to bring URF or any League of Legends affiliated items to Valorant. They want to make clear that Valorant will have no ties with League of Legends whatsoever. 

With that being said, the play on words was the wrong part. The game WILL get NERF skins for their guns, but they won't be inspired by URF.

This was a mistake by my part and I apologize for spreading this. Either Sven and I made a misconception at the event, or Riot decided to not implement the skins at a later date. Either way, I misinformed you a bit, for which I am sorry. I will also post this update in the next video on my channel, so everyone on YouTube is aware of the NERF skins, and be sure to make a pinned comment on the current video.

VALORANT,2020,3,"The dev console on Counter Strike, while rudimentary it is extremely useful and it, as well as community modding/the workshop, provides most of the content that can be created. 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The dev console is very useful for training and fun games with friends. I definitely don’t want a copy of what CS has, instead something a little more refined to experiment with the game. The only game I’ve played more than CS is Overwatch, and burnout was one of the reasons I quit (I left before workshop was I thing). I think something that has helped me stay with CS is being able to mess around in customs. 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Modding is something both games have done well. I did quit Overwatch before the workshop came out but it seems to have a very positive effect on the community.  I really hope this is something VALORANT can learn as it has worked out tremendously with other games. 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The final thing I’d like to address is community map submissions/the workshop. Here I really want to reiterate that they should not copy CS outright. I really want community maps and skins to be a part of the game but CS has flaws. First off I believe that while devs should have veto power, skins should be completely community decided if there are enough submissions(also I’m aware that in f2p it is inevitable that skins cost money but please be more like apex where you can buy skins with in-game currency and cases don’t cost money to open). Maps are more complex and shouldn’t be as community controlled if they are makable at all. I really hope that map submissions are a thing, but they do require a hardcore audience and complex tools so doesn’t really make sense as a day one feature.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
TL;DR
Riot should learn from the ways valve and Blizzard have enabled their communities, but not copy them.

EDIT: All of this is pure wishful thinking in my part and has allegedly been confirmed by devs to not be happening whatsoever.",2020-03-11 00:10:10
VALORANT,2020,3,Cypher Fan Art (OP),2020-03-11 05:02:10
VALORANT,2020,3,"This week I have seen this debated multiple times on this sub. I have seen native players say things along the lines of “I hate that changing res stuff” etc. 

Riot Games have released their statement regarding 30 fps minimum for low end pcs. Anybody who has played a competitive shooter at an even relatively high level will know that 30 fps is quite literally unplayable and will drastically reduce your ability to hit shots and react quickly. IMHO playing on anything under 200 fps puts you at a decent disadvantage to players with higher fps.

As somebody who did not have a high end computer for a long time, by lowering my CSGO res to 1024 x 768, I was able to to go from about 30-70 fps to 130-170 fps on average. This singular feature allowed me to to compete with players with much higher spec pcs than me, and allowed me to go from silver to LE.

I believe Riot’s idea of disallowing stretched res is actually done with competitive integrity in mind. 

Unfortunately, they may end up doing the opposite.
A vast majority of the player base is not going to have 144hz/240hz monitors OR high end pcs, also the majority of new players are not going to use black bars. Because of this, I believe allowing players to play on all resolutions including stretched will actually to some degree level the playing field. 

If you don’t like changing your res, 1920 x 1080 is ALWAYS going to be a part of the game. Players who do like playing on stretched res should be given the option to play on the settings most comfortable to them. CSGO and R6 are both highly competitive at the pro level and both have unlocked res.

In order for Valorant to do well as a game, and as an Esport, Riot are going to have to win over a decent chunk of the CS, R6 and Fortnite playerbase. I believe allowing all resolutions can only increase their chances of doing that successfully.

Interested to hear what the community thinks about this.",2020-03-11 06:20:39

The numbers will not show up in game but can be viewed by friends.

There is no rush/hurry to be the first to secure a name for the release of Valorant and you can have the name of whatever you like. The only difference between names will be the numbers. Numbers can also only be changed every 90 days.

If you're stressing to get the name you want you dont have to. Unless riot games decides to change this system or already has that I havent seen you dont have to be concerned about this system.

VALORANT,2020,3,"Hey everyone!

I'm developing a little and humble moviemaking / visual content community for valorant, and I'm looking for content creators and youtubers, even people that will stream the game can join us. The main idea of the website is to promote videos and streams (also it's creators) and doing moviemaking stuff too (edits, clips, basics), as soon as riot makes it possible. We will give the necessary tools to start into the world of moviemaking and editing for valorant.

Yes, I know it's very early to search for content creators if we don't even have a beta for the game - but there are people already preparing its channels for valorant, so firsts will come first!

A bit of a deeper explanation about the site:

1. People will send videos in its simpliest format: a link to a YouTube video will be enough, Twitch streams will also be accepted.
2. We will promote in the website making a self post for it and giving our point of view of what we saw.
3. Guests will be able to watch through website (video posts), giving it's creator the youtube views, and being able to rate and comment videos too inside our site.
4. Videos with the most rating will be highlighted in the main page for a couple days, until another video goes popular and overlays the last one.

It will kinda works like warcraftmovies worked on its days.

I'll give you twitter and site link (still in beta), hope is not too much spam (or dont consider as if it was, at least :P):  [https://twitter.com/ValorantMovies](https://twitter.com/ValorantMovies) / [www.valorantmovies.com](https://www.valorantmovies.com)

VALORANT,2020,3,"For some reason there's no confirmed information compilation stickied on this subreddit. (Or I somehow missed it)

Maybe we can gather all information that is currently available here and someone can turn it into a pretty list to keep updated over the following months.

Off the top of my head:

Game is mechanically mostly based on cs:go.

It's a 5v5 tactical shooter in a best of 24 (first to 13) where one team defends / defuses the ""spike"" and one team attacks / plants the ""spike"".

I'm not even sure on the number of agents revealed yet but they're the playable characters that are unique within each team(not sure on this!), unswappable during a match and come with more or less unique abilities that are similar to utility in cs:go but also go beyond them as there are far more abilities / agents than utility grenades in cs:go that cover many more functionalities in total. 
Every agent has the same defensive and offensive capabilities besides their abilities, coming with 100 health and the same itemshop for each round (guns and 25/50 shield).

Anyone with anything to correct and/or add is very much invited to do so. Any and all data posted here is posted (to be replicated) to be shared with others.",2020-03-12 08:52:19
VALORANT,2020,3,"Stretching the resolution is a preference and it doesn't give unfair advantage, If it did then every pro CS:GO, R6 SIEGE player would have been using it 

*Example of unfair Stretched res:*  _Every pro (Not CCs) was using pre nerf stretched in Fortnite because it gave an unfair advantage without any tradeoffs bit that's not the case with CS:GO, the split among players with custom res is pretty even_

Some people say that it gives an ""unfair advantage"" by making player models look bigger. But it comes at a cost of lowered FOV and faster moving target.

It doesn't make the game drastically easier. There are so many top tier pros who doesn't use stretched res and have insane aim like Ropz ( [So good that people accused him for aimbotting](https://youtu.be/jB1G4jEWK7o) ), Shroud etc.

All the good and competitive FPS Esports had it for years without any problems.

Regardless of price and time to grind to unlock the characters, most people might get turned off of a game if they see a character they want to play locked right when they start the game up for the first time. If Riot is aiming for the fanbase of games with only paid cosmetics then putting essential characters that impact the game directly seems like a bad idea.

VALORANT,2020,3,"Contrary to what most think, I think that next week will be the final character teaser trailer. What's my reasoning? It's simple, of all the characters announced so far, we've only gotten 3 ""official"" character renders, these being for Phoenix, Viper and Jett (these are the fancy art of them we see at the beginning of their teaser videos). These artworks were initially released around the time the information embargo for the game was released and so far there seem to be no signs of any more artworks of these kinds in the near future. Now we take that information, line up the expected release date for the next teaser and then correlate that the date we get is approximately 3 weeks from the release of the embargo, which lo and behold is the ""leaked"" date for the beta by the Sentinels. That's my theory, not foolproof, but I think it's highly likely based on the available information.

Edit: For clarification, I don't think the beta will necessarily start next week Thursday/Friday, however, I do think that info on it will be announced around that time and a beta for it started soon after. The beta will, of course, prioritize streamers and influencers as the event was cancelled, also this would explain why the Sentinels would be privy to this information, but I do think it will likely be a closed beta, inviting those that signed up early and, if they do the same system as they did with LoR, access granted to viewers of streamers with Riot accounts. Now the reason I believe this is two-fold.

1. Because when Slasher originally leaked info about the influencer event etc, he stated that there would be a beta in a couple of weeks, this was prior to the cancellation announcement, so clearly there were already plans for a closed beta of some sorts, we also know that there would be a closed beta first, based on the subscription prompt on the Valorant website.
2. If they only grant access to streamers and influencers, this would limit the MM pool so queue times would be much higher than normal. In a coordinated setting, aka the hands-on event, they were planning, this could be alleviated, however coordinating this via online lobbies/discord servers would be harder and a lot of time would be wasted in just setting up a single match when they want to spend most of that time actually showcasing the game.
3. *Conspiracy theorist point: Coronavirus, more people inside to watch the game and streamers play.*",2020-03-13 12:18:57

**Viper**

Viper, an only child named Sarah from the United states. She always looked up to her dad who worked at a chemical company. One time Sarah was going with her father to work for a day because she always admired what her father did. Sarah loved chemistry. So they were on a boat which had the goal to drop chemical waste in the ocean. At a certain moment Sarah decided to play hide &amp; seek with her dad. He struggles but he’s on he’s break so what can it hurt? While her dad is counting, Sarah seeks the perfect hiding spot so her dad will never find her. She sees this container with smaller containment boxes with “Dangerous Chemical” warning signs on them. Sarah was young and thought nothing of it. What Sarah didn’t realize was that she was in a container that was about to be dropped into the ocean. So she goes into the container and after 2 minutes of hiding the door fully closes and gets locked. Sarah is scared now and wants to leave but can’t. She’s banging as hard as she can on the doors but no one hears her. The container gets right above the ocean and then drops. Sarah is drowning and she is in contact with all kinds of highly dangerous chemicals. The container drops down to the seafloor and because of that the container door slams opens. After 10 minutes her dad is starting to get suspicious and is shouting around the whole deck looking for he’s daughter but with no response. While in great panic, he thinks that he’s little girl might be in the container that dropped into the ocean. The container gets pulled up but no evidence of her body. Sarah’s entire body got filled with so many chemicals no human should ever have to experience. She’s burning, choking and enduring pain that is unbearable. Eventually she passed out. When she wakes up,  her body is merged with the chemicals and her brain is filled with rage. Her rage is set on the people that made her become this, that made her endure all this pain and suffering. She goes on the hunt for the people from the chemical company to find and kill every single last one of them, starting with the person who made the container drop. She finds him and goes after him. When she finds him, she makes him drop onto he’s floor in he’s living room.  He’s laying on the floor begging for mercy but Sarah doesn’t listen. The rage in her head, that VOICE in her head, is telling her, kill him. And she does it without mercy. A ruthless kill which changed her life, forever. Sarah is no longer Sarah, Sarah has jsut become: Viper.",2020-03-13 17:39:05

**Pheonix**

   
Phoenix, born in Brixton, had always wanted to sign up to the army. This was common for the younger lads of their generation. Growing up his friends realised joining the armed forces wasn't as exciting as they once thought however Phoenix still had his mind set. When the time finally came to enroll, Phoenix stood in line with the same excited feeling he had as a child. Time passed and the new recruits were getting settled into their new way of life. Unfortunately for Phoenix he had struggled to fit in since the beginning. The other recruits would bully him as he had difficulty running the drills and was dragging the team down. One night outside of camp the team were relaxing by a bonfire. Phoenix wasn’t invited as usual but he decided for a change he would try to join in with the fun. He walked down the path towards the blazing inferno that the men stood around. Once he got close, the other men started to tease him and laugh because he had turned up. One thing led to another and an argument broke out between phoenix and the alpha of the pack. Phoenix felt so tired of the bullying that he received and threw a punch. Unfortunately for him it was easily dodged and the man pushed him back. Phoenix tripped. Before he knew it he was submerged in flames. The men gasped however there was no noise coming from the fire. They expected at least some screaming. Phoenix felt a feeling rush through his body he had never felt before. He felt a burning but strangely for him it wasn't painful. He quickly jumped up from the fire and out of instinct pushed his hand out towards his attacker. To everyone's surprise a ball of fire was shot from his hands.",2020-03-13 17:42:25

Pc already has so many alternatives, and literally the only thing this game has going for it there is that it is made by Riot. This game is literally made for console. People will ignore its bad graphics due to it being ftp (and being on console), whereas ftp games on pc have a higher standard due to specs.

As well, it would be the only triple A console game that plays like Cs. That is what I though the selling point was supposed to be, that it was counterstrike on console, but now that I know it will not be releasing on console... well it is going to be dead before it starts. 

Yes, it may have a large player base at launch (but still small compared to other releases that launch on console), but it is simply not unique enough to make it on pc alone. I am genuinely astounded that they are not releasing this for console, it is literally a game made for console. And mark my words, if it doesn’t launch on console it will fail. 

It may not die completely, simply due to who is making it, and the endless stream of cash they will throw at it, but I guarantee it will underperform, and will be all but dead this time next year.",2020-03-16 00:02:48

VALORANT,2020,3,"First of all, lets get this out of the way: I am really hyped for Valorant. The only game that ever where able to draw me in for serveral years were League, and if there would ever be another game to do the same, I could imagine Valorant being that.

However, I am curious to see how well the different design of the Agents stand out in a match. I like what has been leaked so far with the 8 agents, but comparing it to the character design of League, it is clear that they are going for some more realistic/understated characters. 

It made me think about the first time I encountered League. February 2011, I saw one of my friends play the game, and I was instantly intrigued. Just from watching him play, I was able to tell the characters apart, and have a nice understanding of what their abilities where. The graphics where of course simpler than they are today, but for me the character design made each character stand out.

I wonder how well we will be able to recognise Valorant Agents in the heat of battle. From the limited gameplay that has been presented, I was having a hard time destinquishing one character from another. Of course most of that is from a lack of actually playing the game, but still, just from watching that first game of League, I felt more connected to the characters there, than I am with the Valorant agents.

Taking examples from Apex Legends, I think that each of the base eight characters that was available at release was quite distinquishable from another. Where in valorant, for me at least, the agents seem less recognisable from each other. 

On the other hand, this might be a clever design choice on Riots side. The market is oversaturated with hero shooters, where some of the general character designs repeat themselves (Overwatch, Paladins, etc.) Maybe by making their characters less flashy, they actually manage to create an unique vibe for the game?

Or hey! Maybe it is just to give us a real good incentive for spending those $$$ on cosmetics ;)

Would love to hear someone elses thoughts on this:

1. Do you like the Agent Designs, and why/why not?
2. Do you think it is a deliberate design choice to have the characters look simpler than League/Overwatch/Apex characters?
3. Which of the Agents do you think have the most recognisable design?",2020-03-16 12:57:30

When I don't see why wouldn't they support 4:3 it would be an even bigger reason for CSGO players to try the game and maybe swap. Not having 4:3 support and abilities in CSGO like game, is a big turnoff of CSGO players. So in my mind I can't see a good reason why there wouldn't be 4:3 support in VALORANT.

Because League is so popular in Korea, many people think that Valorant will be very popular in Korean, but not in reality. In Asia and especially in Korea,Valorant faces big criticism. Asian users value visuals more than you think.

Despite having low quality graphics, Crossfire and Sudden Attack were popular because they were released in 2006. Recently, games released in China and Korea have invested heavily in graphic quality. PUBG is a great success in Korea and China, and the specification isn't low. Every PC Bang has spec computers that can play PUBG.

For people who don't know who that is, Volcano was the original creator of one of Counter Strikes best maps ( IMO ) Cache,  also have a part to play in the map Nuke, he made a remake of the map in 2012. Some of the changes he made were implemented into the new nuke.

This doesn't eliminate my concern over a map having 3 bombsites. I feel like the defence will be spread out forcing the defence to re-take a site every round, but, having someone, as experienced as Volcano, will be a huge help to ensure that the maps are balanced.

What really bothered me and many others about csgo were the russians, who always have to speak russian in the team chat. Of course there are also a lot of german french or whatever people who behave like that, but it was very present with the russians and because they don't have their own server it was a bit understandable. I hope that there will be rules for valorant that forbid to speak other languages than English in the voice chat, except of course if the whole lobby is German for example.

This is half request half discussion point.

It would be really cool to have a client side lightweight aim practice map. You can allow a client download for all people who wouldn’t have a closed beta access like 1 - 2 days after the beta start so we won’t affect testers, but still could start practicing early. And since it would be a local map, you wouldn’t need to deploy a whole backend network to support many people who will be really happy to use it.

And after the launch this could be transferred into ”practice while queue” feature with the ability to instantly hop on and off this local map.",2020-03-19 23:29:47

VALORANT,2020,3,"Not sure if this has been brought up yet or not but like many of you, I’ve seen post after post calling for Riot to release the beta due to the COVID-19 crisis and subsequent quarantine. 

On the surface, you’d think a time where a good majority of the population is quarantined would be a great time to release the beta. The game would reach more people, helping to engage and jump start massive community growth. It’d be a great way for people to get their minds off of this crisis by immersing themselves in a new game, learning its every in and out. 

While all of these and many more points people have brought up are true, most have e overlooked one MAJOR detail. 

The beta will require a lot of WORK from Riots end, which will in turn require their employees to be IN the office. I’m sure they want things to go as smoothly as possible with this highly lauded game that is poised to be one of the top games in the world in the next few years if not sooner. To that effect, it would make more sense to wait until things normalize. Yes it won’t be as optimal for people as it would be if it were released now while we’re all at home, but it will be of much better quality if Riot is able to handle everything on site and first hand.",2020-03-21 14:56:17

TLDR: im thinking the release for the game is gonna be late may or early June based on the character 'reveals'

I don't feel like there's a downside to having that in Valorant.,2020-03-23 02:37:01

VALORANT,2020,3,"The most polarising discussion topic in the sub right now is whether 4:3 Stretched will be available in the game on not. CS:GO players don't have problems with stretched res and OE players think 4:3 Stretched gives unfair advantage.

I have played on both 4:3 and 16:9 and I don't find problems on playing with either of those. It's a preference thing

The Most popular arguments put against Stretched res are

- _It makes player models wider but has no disadvantages_

**Yes it does make Hitboxes bigger but it has disadvantages, it makes enemy movement faster and  player's movement as well. It also decreases the FOV and X and Y Sensitivity feels different.**

- _Faster moving targets is not a big disadvantage as player movement is slower in Valorant_

**Yes, it is slower in Valorant but is a 4:3 player will face faster moving targets than a 16:9 player and Slower moving targets are always easier to hit and track relative to a faster moving target.**

- _All CS:GO pros in Top 20 use 4:3 Stretched_

**That's half true, almost all players in top 20 use 4:3 but many use 4:3 black bars which is almost the same as 4:3 since player model with and other things are same, it just cuts the sides of the game. If you see the Top 500 list (which is more stable than Top 20 and has a bigger sample size which makes it better for the purpose), 55% use 4:3 Stretched, 40% use 4:3 black bars (Almost the same as 16:9) and 5% use 16:9. So 55% play on Stretched while 45% play on non Stretched, pretty even split.**

Asking for removing stretched res is almost the same as **ASKING TO REMOVE LOW SENSITIVITY** and all the argument used against Stretched res on this sub surprisingly perfectly fits Low sens argument as well.

- Just Adapt, it's a new game.
- It gives unfair advantage
- All the pros play on Low sens because its so advantageous
- Legends like S1mple and Woxic who play on High Sensitivity are just outliers.
- If someone wants to be competitive, he shouldn't be forced to play on such an ugly sens where he has to Throw his arm a metre away just to do a 180.

All these arguments are true to an extent, but only those who have played on Low Sens knows how hard it is to make the switch. Yes, High Sens is playable but those who have been playing on low Sens for a really long time will find Valorant less appealing. And it will make the game hard it sell to those people when It just doesn't have to be that way (and has never been that way EVER). 

Same argument can be made for Stretched Resolution as well.

But the Finalll decision lies in the hands of Riot Games. All we can do is just let them know about our point of view.

_**I KNOW I AM GOING TO GET THOUSANDS OF DOWNVOTES FOR POSTING THIS SO BRING THEM ON**_

VALORANT,2020,3,"As we all know this game seems to literally be cherry picking ideas from other games. Am I excited for it? Of course. BUT I am hoping for at least something to be new. The only thing I could imagine them reworking is competitive game types. The bomb site objectives are tried and true and of course I want that as an option. I'd like to see some new game modes that are used competitively. As to what they could be I wouldn't know but Riot could at least try to do some creative work on their end. We'll see what happens, but I honestly don't think they'll deviate away from csgo/siege. Thoughts?",2020-03-23 16:31:58

VALORANT,2020,3,"My solution would be 'any high skilled player, who knows the game, who cares for the game and the community should contribute, and 20-30minutes a day, while resting, with a cup of tea/coffee (im a coffee guy myself) look for cheaters, through the report system or whatever. Unlike overwatch in cs go, where a potential suspect would have to be checked probably a hundred times ( alot of resources wasted) it would require less engagement through making a player's decision who has big experience in viewing suspects and who is accurate at it - more valuable than a random's random random decision.  


 Imho, if cs go overwatch did work, cheater race would have gone extinct a loooooong time ago my duud. Its flawed, its a waste of time. It shows lack of respect to people who spend their time/life resources on it. (ve been there myself sadly. Very unrewarding system) 

&amp;#x200B;

And of course - double or maximally - tripple cheking to make sure that AS LITTLE AS POSSIBLE non-cheaters get banned this way. There will be casualties. There s never going without, i m sure, but action must be taken . . . lol . . .  


Make the heaters grind their way back to the top. . .lets say 100 hours, just to get banned again through account leveling system, where, jsut like in old League of Legends u had to grind to that level 30 in order to play ranked matches. ( whose accounts will be subject to overwatch cheater seeking)  


As everybody knows in this shithole Era knows, brain works on dopamine and other similar funny stuff like that, so - naturally - there SHOULD be reward for ACCURATE cheater spotting. . . Making it sort of a Sport. A polar oposite fever, where everybody would looove to get 'their' cheater spotted and banned. Of course, like i said; making accurate decisions count waaay more than the random random ones. Random. Thanks for reading. I m anxiously anticipating for your feedback.  


Also, sorry for my bad english. . . its not my first language. . . Also sorry if there was too much heat in a few places of this post, but i m burning with vengeance towards cheaters who i, personally, despise.  


TL;DR   
1. Make proficient players at the game look for cheaters.  
2. Double or triple check each case, no more.

3. Ban according to judges decision 'weight'.  
4.Reward players for accurate case reviews with cosmetics that can not be obtained through other means.  
5. Cheater problem solved.",2020-03-23 19:45:04

The reloading and swapping to the weapon feels “squeaky”. Coming from rainbow six and csgo the gun animations feel more clean and impactful. Especially dislike the swapping to knife animation.

I don't have a ton of time for games, but with things like Wild Rift coming to mobile and FPS games more accessible than ever I still find I can find fun in PvP style games.

Normally for FPS games I stick to console (Titanfall 2, Halo 5, Modern Warfare 2019, Siege) but I'm very interested in this and grew up on PC FPS titles (but never played CS).

How ""old person"" friendly is this?  I like games like Siege because your aim/reflexes don't need to be exceptional to have a good time in casual.  I find games like Halo 5 harder to play these days because it's SO mechanically demanding.

It does seem like some characters (Jett) won't be my style but some slower characters may be?

""This can always change, but my current thinking is that all accounts that we identify using tricks are permanently suspended.

&gt;Part of the anti-cheat effort will be made by an Artificial Intelligence system called Vanguard. This AI will monitor players and ban suspects. ""The platform will act on all fronts, from the investigation to the banning of the user"". Chamberlain also explains that the main cheats and hacks used in FPS games, such as aimbots and wallhacks, have already been studied and are on the radar of this AI. Thus, a user who always shoots enemies in the head or who can ""predict"" what happens outside their field of vision will be a potential suspect.",2020-03-24 22:33:24

I love that I'm Valorant it's seems like it's easier to hold angles and you don't have to be doing stupid jiggle peeks and such. Movement seems much more fluid and graceful.

And, the embargo for the gameplay streamers will capture on 27th lifts on [3rd April](https://twitter.com/Slasher/status/1243274475195502609?s=19). So the beta might start from 3rd April.

VALORANT,2020,3,How to prepare for VALORANT and Why - Noizeeh,2020-03-27 14:35:54
VALORANT,2020,3,"Hey, all the information on [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7SZwInLNfo) video is from Zerator, a french YouTuber who was invited out to Dublin in January to play the game.

Obviously, not everyone speaks French, so I will try to translate as best as I can. I'm from Montreal, so the words he uses, aren't quite the same as the ones I use, but I'll try my best.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Tell us a bit about what you felt playing the game, how it played

&amp;#x200B;

I was invited to Dublin with Alpha in January. We were very few, 2 french people, which surprised me. That was also pretty honoring for me. Aaaaand, the game is VERY GOOD, but, its annoying, because I feel like the video ( The round ) doesn't represent AT ALL what the game is. Honestly, I find that the video is terrible. The demo gameplay that they showed here actually ""de-serves"" the game. ( He's trying to  say that it actually does the opposite of helping or ""serving"" the game ) In fact, I don't know who at riot made this, this isn't good work. I was surprised that they published this even. It looks like an unfinished game. It felt like we played a better game than this trailer. I know that the people playing aren't that good, so that might be part of it. If they made a fragmovie, it would obviously look insane. I know that a few buddies there in the playtest did 5 kill rounds and it was awesome. But I felt like they tried too hard to show spells and they kinda stuffed everything in together.

So this map was called Triade ( He's speaking of Haven, it might be called Triade in French or maybe it's that they changed names. AlphaCast also said that names like  Jett were changed after they playtested the game so that's entirely possible ) , which has 3 bombsites, and since the NDA is gone, I can say all of it.  There's a million things to say about the game. I didn't do a livestream / video on the topic because everyone already jumped on it and did it too quick, so I felt like It would be easy for people to find the things they were looking for anyways. The game is REALLY COOL, but it's very CS.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;And yeah, something a lot of people were afraid of  was that this game would be too much like Overwatch because we see a bunch of spells. There's 2 types of agents : DPS and Assist

&amp;#x200B;

NONONO. Not really! Let's say it's not really official, not like OW. It's not classed. Certain characters have a few more utility abilities ( that are supportive ) .

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;But they did announce a Angel character like in OW that heals, revives no?

So there's ONE CHARACTER, that has a res and 3 abilities. This is a very supporty character. But all the other characters have a balance of support and attack. As an example, the character with the smoke ( He's talking about Jett ) has an Ult which pulls her Kunais out. This game is really good. I think that people will be blown away when the game comes out. I'm not paid by riot by the way.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;A lot of people were sad that it was too cartoony

Yeah the game is similar to realm royale. We were hanging out in the menus of the game too. It reminded me of League of legends. There are realistic skins and some wacky skins. We saw a deagle with a realistic skin, a futuristic skin, and a water gun skin. You don't really see this stuff in CS a lot.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;What do you think of the name?

I don't really care. In reality, we don't really care about it. In a few years we won't care haha

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;The character design feels quite underwhelming.

I feel like it was really nice.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Is the game as strategic as CS? What's the difference with CS? Anything besides Spells?

You have to understand that the game is INCREDIBLY horizontal. There's like one map with a balcony. It's fine because certain characters have a few verticality functions. Some have a wall that they can go on top of. ANOTHER THING, the GUNS ARE EXACTLY like CS. They didn't try to hide this at all. One thing I noticed was that you can buy everything on every side. I personally really like to snipe on these games. We played 3-4 hours of the game. Every spell in the game needs to be bought. The ULT is earned by killing people and getting orbs. On average, PER HALF ( 12 rounds ), you get your ULT ONCE OR TWICE. Twice if you're really good. The timing becomes a strategic thing to think about, because you have to time your ults and know when to use them. Certain ultimates help you 1v3 for example.

In fact, at the start , when we were getting into it, we weren't using abilities much, while the rioters (devs) were making FIREWORKS ON THE MAP, POISON HERE, SMOKE HERE, FLASH TO THE LEFT, WOOO,  BUT THE THING IS ,we were better at aiming , so we shit on them haaha...

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Pricing?

I didn't see anything about pricing but I'd be surprised if its far from Leagues model. We saw CHARACTER SKINS, GUN SKINS, NO CASES, but there were also certain things like ""300 Ares points to unlock this skin"" [Timestamp](https://youtu.be/S7SZwInLNfo?t=655)

For me ,honestly, I don't see how this game WOULDNT EXPLODE the entire FPS ecosystem. This is gonna be a crazy game.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Do you think CS players will have a hard time playing this game because of spells?

Nope. I think Overwatch players will hate this game. Yep, I really think so.Because its TOO DIFFERENT. It's not at all the same product.  I think that CS players will LOVE this game. The players that like Fortnite but also CS will LOVE this game, but the players that just like Fortnite will hate the game. Because again, it's NOT the same. This isn't a game like Fortnite with a bunch of verticality, people shooting from all 360 degrees. It's very streamlined like CS. It's about timings, positioning. There's a lot of in depth stuff like  : "" Do I give this orb to my teammate so HIS ult gets there faster? "" There's also the economy that's in depth like CS.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Is this a game that you are hyped for? We're gonna do a survey in chat to see if you're excited by Valorant.  
&gt;  
&gt;Other reporter : Me, yeah. Whenever there's a new IP, It's super fun to test it. I'm really scared, however ,that the game is super tryhard and too difficult to have fun in.

This is a super important point. This is what I'm afraid of too. So I went with AlphaCast ( other french youtuber ) and he is an Overwatch player. He had a really rough time getting kills when he started. His first game was like 0-23. I remember, he turned to me and said : "" This is very CS 🙃"" a few times hahahahah. This is obviously gonna be scary for a casual player.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Riot definitely has a nice mindset. They talked about the tickrate. Ping. Etc.  They're making other games. They're announcing quality servers.

&amp;#x200B;

Well yeah, that's the advantage when you have an infinite budget , you have time hahah. It's that you have time and you can't skip corners. hahah. But honestly, they're doing this really well!

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Edit:

In the interview he says

""At the game session we played in Dublin, they said there would be mod ops DAY ONE. I think with league they learned with modops, replay because it took so long there.""

Thanks for the comments and clarifications. The Mod Obs is a replay viewing system and it should, on paper, be available on launch day. That’s really awesome to hear.",2020-03-27 17:26:00

VALORANT,2020,3,"Basically, instead of having a ""whoever loads in and clicks first gets their agent,"" system, what if there was a dice roll system? Say, all 5 players have an auto dice roll. Whoever rolls the highest picks first, second highest picks next and so on. If two rolls match, an automatic reroll happens and whoever rolls highest picks first out of them.

I feel like this would eliminate a race against your teammates to pick agents which often has potential to pit teammates against each other. Not saying this won't happen, players will still get salty if the person who won the roll picks their preferred agent, but at least with this, everyone has an equal RNG chance to pick the agent of their choice.",2020-03-28 11:16:42

There was a thread about the release coming out on 19th June. We know there is a beta before Summer. I think they will release the closed beta on April, the open beta around mid may and the release on 17th.

I'm not an official valorant, riot, or game industry affiliate.**

&amp;#x200B;

Here's how to link your riot account to your twitch account, which lets you get those drops\*:

1. Click your profile icon in the top right on the twitch website and go to [Settings](http://prntscr.com/rophyj)
2. In the tabs towards the top, go to [Connections](http://prntscr.com/ropgwp)
3. Scroll down to Riot Games and click [Connect](http://prntscr.com/roptit)
4. A window will pop up, asking for your riot login+pass. It's your actual login username, which isn't necessarily the same as your in-game league username. The same one you use to login to the client.

&amp;#x200B;

After you're done\*, watching a valorant stream will net you a chance at a key at random intervals. Make sure it's not muted in the background (1% volume works) and that the stream title has something similar to \[Drops Enabled\] in the title.

VALORANT,2020,3,"I've taken the liberty after looking at another post that directs a twitter link to then a article that was posted today from Dot eSports and just wanted to just leave the important stuff that was noted from the article here to those that don't want to go to the link. If not, you can direct yourselves to the full article [here](https://dotesports.com/valorant/news/valorant-playtest-details-revealed-tier-based-ranked-play-new-agent-cosmetics-more)

***Agents***

* [*Last month an article from Dot eSports reported originally that VALORANT would have ""eight playable characters""*](https://dotesports.com/valorant/news/all-character-abilities-valorant)  (or, Agents), now one more has been reportedly added in this article making the total to nine playable Agents
* *Breach* is one of the most overpowered agents in the playtest due to his abilities and ultimate
   * G ability is called ""*Aftershock*"" while ""Q"" and ""E"" are dubbed *Flashpoint* and *Fault Line*
      * **Flashpoint** (as the name implies) is described as a flashbang
      * **Fault Line** described as a Stun Grenade that slows and sways the enemy's aim
   * Ultimate ability called ""**Rolling Thunder**"" caused ""outcry"" among playtesters as it ""dealt massive amounts of damage""
* Other notes involved playtesters praising the Agents *Viper, Sova, and Sage*
   * Omen is considered a weak Agent due to his ultimate, **""From the Shadows""** being nerfed
* A tester noted a free Agent could be unlocked after a few matches
* Asides the article from boop pl, the Alpha discord had no mentions of an Agent called *Dillion*

***Cosmetics***

* Similar to LoL, CS:GO, and Apex
   * Unlocked through completion of contracts, tasks are allocated to the different Agents you play as and grant free cosmetics
   * No character skins were present in the playtest
   * Weapon skins, keychains, and sprays were mentioned
      * Weapon skins are allocated in different sets, which make the same skin available for other weapons (universal? just me assuming)

***Ranked Mode***

* Similar ranking system to League, but different titles
   * 8 ranks titled *Mercenary, Soldier, Veteran, Hero, Legend, Mythic, Immortal, and the highest being VALORANT.*
   * Each rank has 3 tiers that players will progress through to get to the next, just like League's ranked system
      * VALORANT, being the highest tier, won't have three tiers, similar to Challenger in League
* A playtester lists that choosing the Agents you play was a ""first-come-first-serve"" basis.
   * Players who select their desired agent and locked them in would get to use that Agent for the match
* Nothing about banning agents is listed in the article.

***Overtime system***

* Similar system to how other FPS titles have theirs to finish a match instead of ending in a draw
   * Matches will end after 25 rounds regardless of scoreline
      * 12 - 12 --&gt; match moves to overtime round, whichever team gets 13 wins the match
* It's also noted in this portion that in-game currency used to buy weapons and abilities is called ""creds""
   * Each player is given 5,000 creds at the start of the final round in overtime

***Other important things***

* Weapons are similar to CS:GO weapons
   * Skilled-based as scoping in impacts fire rate, guns become less useful once aimed-in
* Practice mode confirmed,
   * Private servers
      * Custom servers / private matches up to 10 players (5v5)
   * Shooting range
* Playtesters were given the opportunity to stretch their game with 4:3 res, but black bars appeared at the top and bottom of the screen
* ""M"" on KB to bring up map, Riot tried to implement place location names but feature was bugged during the playtest
* Ping system
   * Split between different types like League
* Spike (the bomb) defusal timer doesn't reset like in CS:GO (i.e if you cancel, you gotta defuse from the start again)
   * You can exit from the animation and re-enter to defusing halfway rather than start from the beginning

That's pretty much it to the article from Dot eSports.",2020-03-30 16:33:42

Knives such as the Luxe Knife have no extra animation at all, and most of the others share the same one (like Ruin, Elderflame and others). An equip at least like the bayonets in CSGO would even work tbh, it just feels too stale for a knife I paid so much VP for.

Also while I'm at it, do you think a tag on dropped weapons like ""XXX's Elderflame Vandal"" would be nice? (like in csgo)

Edit: small correction

Edit 2: I feel like this needs a bit of clarification, I use CSGO as a reference to better explain myself and help you guys better visualize what I'm trying to say. By no means am I trying to compare the two games.

Edit 3: Just some final remarks before the post dies off: My main motivation for creating this post was to point out the clunkiness with the animations. I'm not saying the game needs over the top unique animations for the knives, just a small *pop* when you switch to the knife or inspect it, so it feels better when you Q-Q or spam inspect for fun.

I have been playing valorant for a while now. The highest was bronze and the lowest iron. 

There are so many bots in Valorant that it just is unplayable anymore. I get it if people are bad, if they feed, if they leave the game or disconnect for whatever reason. 

But Riot should not allow people to use bots and afk. They should just get banned straight away. This person is a bot that just crouches and moves forward and shoots. So riot's system doesn't think that he is afk.

This means riot still thinks he is playing the game. (I have recorded a video of this in the link down below if you want to see what I mean).

Because riots system cant detect them as afk, We can't surrender and they spawn every round. We don't get extra money or ulti orb. So we are basically taken hostage. Some people just leave then. And the only other thing to do is just sit there and wait till the enemy comes and kill you over and over again.

This is a low bronze, high bronze game. I dont know if this happens in higher ranks or not. But this is unplayable.

I dont know why riot is not doing anything about this. I don't think it should be hard to identify these bots because of their behavior. They are using a macro doing the same thing over and over again. In this instance, it is crouching and shooting constantly.

&amp;#x200B;

This is also a name and shame. I know Riot has a report system. But it just doesn't seem to work. Just ban people straight away if they are using bots or macros.

VALORANT,2021,1,"Hi, I am just wondering something quick. I have been playing this game really regularly ever since July-August. I started out Iron 3. I am currently g2. Even though I know that I'll get better the longer I play (for example, I may get diamond in like march or something), I just feel like so many others are progressing faster. For example, I see people who have only played this game for 3 months and they have gotten to plat-diamond with no previous fps experience. High elo players, how long did it take for you guys to get to where you are? (if you're a previous overwatch/cs player, how long did it take for you to get good too?) How much effort did it take? What helped you a lot?",2021-01-01 02:53:29
VALORANT,2021,1,"I've noticed recently that I seem to misjudge animations and I can't tell if it's just me needing to get the timing down, or if they're actually sloppy on the server-side. 

So for example a situation that will happen frequently enough for me to notice it is this:

I come around a corner or something and I see an enemy player in the middle of the pulling-out-the-gun animation, you know where they cock the gun before being able to fire it. When I see this, I usually try to line up my shot a little better rather than just shooting. And as I line up my shot, I get headshotted. It seems like their gun just snaps into place without the animation finishing. So while I thought I had an extra half second or so, I just get killed. 

I know the root problem is that my aim isn't good enough for me to make those shots faster, and I'll be the first to say that I'm not good at this game and I have a lot to learn and practice, but I'm curious if anyone else has noticed/perceived this. Is this real? Or am I just misjudging the speed of the animation?

I'm sure ping has something to do with this, but I usually get \~45ms ping when I'm playing, and I can't imagine it's normal at that ping.",2021-01-01 02:54:38

VALORANT,2021,1,"Role:Classified Agent Wildcard Ultimate: Ultimate gives any agent's ultimate in the game. Using ult will trigger a menu asking the player which agent's ultimate to use. Wildcards signature: Player can copy any other player's alternative abilities disregarding their signature ability. He has two cards every match and he can recharge and get only one more card in the same match by getting three kills, this can be changed. Ex: Cannot use pheonix's hot hands. The player can only take one of each ability Ex: If Wildcard throws a card on Jett's body, he can only take updraft or cloudburst, but he will not receive three cloud bursts only one, and he cannot use his second card on the same agent. This is done by throwing a card on an enemies body (similar to cypher's ultimate) or just throwing it on a teamate within a certain vicinity. The player after using the signature will receive that specified agent's side abilities like jetts cloudburst and updraft but wild card will not receive the agent's signature.

VALORANT,2021,1,I have been forced to play support characters for the past week because of 2 instalocking duelists every game and I have realized how important the role of a support character is and how they might not have kills but the Intel or abilities help so much to the overall team  I have also realized how many people insta lock duelists and bottom frag there for making the supports try and pick up their fraggers weight despite not having fighting abilities to take aggressive angels.  I know that the duelists might be having a bad day but they are only there for one game and that one game makes all the difference for the supports rank.  This is in a example of supports gaining less then duelists in a win because they cant frag out and losing a lot more because they were lower in the leaderboard in terms of kills. Even though they have the utility that helps their team.  So for all you support mains out there thank you for your support (pun?) And I hope the next act helps the ranked system for you guys.,2021-01-01 03:41:53

VALORANT,2021,1,"Valorant is not an ""aim heavy"" game but that doesn't mean aim training is useless.

I've seen a lot of misinformation and pseudo science on the topic so I wanted to give some real information that everyone can find useful, and help you improve at valorant.

1-Muscle memory is not what you are training for. 

Muscle memory(as it's commonly described) is of no use while aiming. When aim training you are training for mouse control. The way muscle memory applies is in technique, similar to what martial artist do, instead of training to do a specific, rigid movement you want a guideline on how to move your mouse while being precise, smooth, etc.

2-Aim labs is not an actual aim trainer. 

Aim labs is a data collection tool, lacs scenarios and the scenarios it does have lack versatility and can be found on other aim trainers. 

 If you are serious on imroving your aim, Koovaks and Aimbeast are the aim trainer you should be using. Koovaks specifically has countless scenarios, a massive community, tons of tools and routines for improving on a specific game, issue, of fundamental and most coaches like Aimer7 focus on koovaks.

Communities like Voltaic have great resources, routines, benchmarks and tools(like a sens randomizer and raw accel driver)

3-Mouse acceleration and multiple sensitivities

Mouse acceleration isn't horrible, but some types of mouse accel are. The most well known are windows pointer precision, logitechs own mouse accel, in game, etc. This are all bad, windows pointer precision accelerates at random intervals, making it unreliable, hard to practice, etc. There are other mouse accel drivers like [this one](https://github.com/a1xd/rawaccel) which can be fine tuned to your liking, although it may interrupt with vanguard so keep that in mind.

Training on multiple senstivities can be extremely useful, this stimulates the part of your brain to adapt and learn and what not ([read](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14zwQOFlQPsdli_rRz4EftlMYbiSfK6IzyjHwVus87Zk/edit)). Using a sens randomizer like [this one](https://github.com/Whisperrr/SensitivityRandomizer) can be extremely usefull and make your aim training more efficient.

That's basically it.",2021-01-01 09:11:12

VALORANT,2021,1,"I recently watched a video on youtube, a creator named [eggwick](https://www.youtube.com/c/eggwick/videos) had uploaded, where his girlfriend who had just started playing FPS titles, went through the Valorant tutorial and had her first match ([https://youtu.be/KgS3CyQvSAQ](https://youtu.be/KgS3CyQvSAQ))

The noobishness ( forgive me all ) present was quite comedic and innocent if I'm being honest. However, I drew many parallels from that video with my own experience.

Valorant is my first FPS title and the first game I've ever been serious about. When I started I knew nothing about aiming, the various map, or even the agents. Luckily for me, the minimap was something I picked quite easily and youtube tutorial videos helped me out a lot.

I remember my first game quite vividly, I was playing phoenix (an agent I knew nothing about and picked based off visual appeal) on split and we kept on hitting the A site. Luckily we had a viper who knew what she was doing and carried the team, however when I think about my actions that day, II can't help but cringe, I didn't manage my economy (kept buying pistols every round lol), kept flashing my teammate, kept running about aimlessly and didn't know how to chat or even ping!

The only good thing I did was wall off cross ( because I saw viper do it :D).

However, I fell into the well of toxicity and got angry when i saw other people doing what I was once guilty of. A match stands out to me in particular, I believe I was playing phoenix on split (De Ja Vu lol ) with a cypher and a Sova (other two were AFK) and the Sova was clearly a young boy (could tell by his voice) and was doing exactly what i and eggwick's girlfriend did in our first games.

At some point, I got mad and began shouting, however, the cypher stepped in and made me see the situation more clearly (Thank God), we all began to talk and had a great experience ( don't even remember if we won or lost :D ).

I re-queued with them and I'm happy to say, that was one of my best days in-game. The Sova hasn't really been online much recently which makes me wonder if he just dropped it. I nearly did the same thing again recently but another cypher stopped me ( Guardian angel) and I remember one with a great sage who was clearly dealing with self-esteem issues ( Thank God My Toxic Days were behind me at this point)

&amp;#x200B;

I'm sure we are all guilty of this in some form or the other and I'm not here to throw shade, all I'm saying is - Let's not harm peoples self-esteem from the way they are treated in-game and ultimately pursue people from the game because what might be common knowledge to some might not be to everyone (Who knew knife walking was faster? lol).

&amp;#x200B;

An Example of this is Fortnite, a game I haven't played but genuinely seems great however the only complaint seems to be a toxic player base.

And so with this, I hope our community become a little bit more welcoming.

&amp;#x200B;

Us plebs stuck in plat/diamond, that solo q is literally impossible to get out. Here an example: I just finished a game team MVP with Reyna on split lost 13-4. We started in attack and after the first pistol I go: ""yo boys don't rush lets play it slow"" And what do they do? Push like there is no tomorrow. Mind you, they did this every round on attack so yeah.. Eventually we finished first half 9-3 for the defenders. In defence we also lost the pistol, because once one guy died in one site either A or B, my team mates would rotate instant. And that leaves on site open and mid open.. The attackers didn't even enter once on site for the plant, no, they just faked one site so these plebs would rotate instant and leave mid and the other site open, and so they would flank from mid and kill everyone.. In the end we won 1 more round to end in 13-4.. Tell me Solo Q is possible c'mon I'm waiting for your argumets :D",2021-01-01 14:07:56

So I deranked from plat 1. Actually from plat 3 because afkers and trolls, but that's another topic. I deranked from plat 1 and lost those 3a (a for arrows). Then I go Match MVP with 3a. Still Gold 3. Ok, fair. Team MVP, 2a down. Match MVP, 2a up. TMVP 2a down. TMVP 2a up. MMVP 2a up.

&amp;#x200B;

So let's assume that from one rank to another it's from 0 to 10 arrows. After you surpass 10, you rank up. After you go down from 0 you rank down. It is something like this, im just gonna use arrows here to simpler math and its what we have to use so.

Worst part is to assume that you fo down from 10 to 8 when you derank. I'm assuming the game is forgiving and gives you a chance to rank back up when you play a very good game and get 3 arrows after that sour lost from the derank. Which has happened to me a few times. Everytime I derank and play a game with 3 arrows up after that lost, I rank back up again. Simple math:

&amp;#x200B;

So, 8-3+3=8. 8-2+2=8. 8-2+2+2=10

Ok, I need 1 more arrow to move up. But now add to that equation that this player was Match MMVP and TMVP every single game. In a row. It doesn't matter? I think it should. There should be a reward here for this. Maybe add 0.25 more ""arrows"" when you get to be Team MVP and maybe 0.5 arrows more when you get to be Match MVP. Win or lose, that should be added. It should reward those players who pushed up and tried their best, and actually got to be the best (at least by the system, which is what moves you up or down), to win those games.

Instead of losing 1 / 2 / 3 arrows, you would be losing 0.75 / 1.75 / 2.75 or 0.5 / 1.5 / 2.5

Instead of winning 1 / 2 / 3 arrows, you would be winning 1.25 / 2.25 / 3.25 or 1.5 / 2.5 / 3.5

To me, it's unfair that being Match or Team MVP counts for nothing. I did The math and I'm still Gold 3. I'm not being rewarded to being the best on my team or on the match. Not even when I'm that for 6 matches in a row. Not even when I'm solo queue.

&amp;#x200B;

Conclusion: Being Match MVP or Team MVP doesn't matter.

&amp;#x200B;

P.S.: After the 3a lost i played vs gold 1, gold 2 and silver 3 in the next match with the 3a up. The i played with plat 3, 2 and 1 on the next match wih the 2a down. Then I don't remember, but mostly a mix of plat and gold.",2021-01-01 15:37:14

VALORANT,2021,1,"After seeing a post about Koreans in high elo think that shotguns (mainly the bucky) are too strong on r/VALORANT a couple months ago, I did an experiment to see if I could climb with shotgun only. Instead of picking the best movement type agents that synergize well with shotguns (Raze and Jett), I picked Sage since I was thinking I could use her wall aggressively to get off-angles against opponents. Also the name Shotgun Sage was funny to me.

I found out that Shotguns are really good, especially if you can master the bucky right click range. The amount of times I was able to get a one-shot was too many.

Utilizing shotguns definitely alter the style of play that most people are not used to and can surprise enemies.

Also Killing people with shotguns make people very angry which you can see some examples here: [Video 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wn6Yy6zSQeY) &amp; [Video 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91kcKDG3wXo&amp;t)

&amp;#x200B;

Below is what I found playing as Shotgun Sage ([Montage of how I hit diamond](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tCwYzNWf04))

**Requirements:**

* Play Sage every game
* Only use Shotguns: Judge, Bucky, and Shorty
* With round loss providing 1900 credits, I am able to force-buy every single round.
* I mainly played with my friends (duo to 5-stack) since I didn't want to ruin any random teammate's games, however when I did solo queue, all my teammates were super nice and loved the fact I was going as Shotgun Sage.

&amp;#x200B;

**Analysis**

* I went 4-1 in my placements and got the rank of Silver 3 (For unrated games, I only lost once before I reached 10 wins).
* It took 53 games from Silver 3 to reach Diamond 1. I had a 73.5% W/L Ratio, 39 Wins - 14 Losses.
* I have a K/D of 1.39, Dmg/Round = 148, HS% = 17.5%, Combat Score of 266, Econ Score of 56
* On Defense, I mainly used the Judge. On Offense, I used Bucky only since the right click has farther range.
* Going shotgun only, I am able to store up my economy and constantly buy for my teammates.
* Even in high plat/low diamond, opponents did not know how to adapt shotguns. People got super tilted and would claim that shotguns are no skill, then start to use them, get killed, rage more, then go back to assault rifles.
* I also had weird experiences with the shorty - I shoot them with 2 shots and hit them with 11 pellets but only did 77 damage. I learned that with the shorty, you have to be almost kissing your opponent for it to kill them, once you start social distancing the shorty damage falls off drastically.
* On pistol rounds, I always went with Wall+Shorty. This leaves me with 300 credits which will allow me to always buy a wall the next round (win or lose).
* My playstyle changed, I learned how to fast-jiggle peek and shoot with the bucky. On defense, I always changed where my location and set-up.
* I found some spots where I can wall up which will allow me to get the perfect bucky-right click oneshot range.

&amp;#x200B;

**Tips on how to counter Shotguns**

* Use your utility: the toughest agents were Sova, Cypher, Breach, Phoenix, and Raze. They are able to clear out corners where someone with a shotgun would hide. Also flashes counter shotgun play super hard.
* Play at a distance, if you know the optimal shotgun right click range, you will also know how far back to stand or if you need to play up close. There are many times where I would right click and it would only do 20 damage since the pellets didn't travel far enough.
* Play smart: the best example I can give is on the map Split. If someone is using a shotgun, they usually play in Mail Room (B-Heaven), therefore you can execute A and they will have a hard time retaking site.

I think that shotguns are very strong especially in force-buying rounds and the round after pistol. I honestly have no idea on how to nerf the bucky right click.",2021-01-01 21:15:51

VALORANT,2021,1,"Hi guys, last week I started to play Valorant again, I played beta, act 1 and I totally skipped act 2.

I peeked immortal 1 in act 1 and now (act 3) I've hit diamond 2 with ease and no pressure at all.

&amp;#x200B;

My problem is that the higher rank I get the more I'm scared of being judged by my teammates for not playing good enough.

This is how my brain works during some high rank games: ""holy sh\*t my Reyna is immortal 3, omg they're all immortal I cannot fk this up"".

I keep pressing tab to check the scoreboard and it's all ok as long as I get a decent amount of frags but my mentality goes from 100 to 0 in a split second if I press tab and I see myself at the bottom of the scoreboard.

It gets worse if any of my teammates makes the slightest comment about my performance during the game, I start to play horribly and I can't wait for the game to end so I can take a break.

It's important to say that I play to improve, not to win that single game, I really want to improve at the game but sometimes anxiety hits so hard I can't keep on playing.

I played on a couple of smurf accounts and the same happens, I reach diamond 2-3 very easy but then I start to get the feeling that all the other players are better than me and I don't want to be judged by them at any cost.

I'd also like to say that this only happens in Valorant: I've been playing league for like 10 years now, no such problems whatsoever; played csgo for over 1000 hours and never experienced anything like that.

&amp;#x200B;

Can anyone give me some tips to overcome this kind of anxiety?

VALORANT,2021,1,"TLDR; do not let people select the same character prior to locking in. No two people can have jett/cypher/omen selected at a time. 

People need the opportunity to build a team composition without locking in. Right now there is no incentive to talk to your team and develop a team comp because if you don't instalock your main there is a low probability you will get to play a character you enjoy. 

Now you could just learn more characters, 

But, if we remove the ability for two people to have the same character up for lock at the same time, those two people can talk about who should go what roll and who should stick with their first pick.",2021-01-01 22:37:23

VALORANT,2021,1,"I was stuck bronze for months!! My fam went on winter vacation so i couldnt play for 10 days. Came back and jumped into comp and ended up silver 3.

I notice that people in the silver - gold range have decent(?) aim but barely any game sense. Where as people in bronze have no aim/mechanics, but some actually have game sense.

Theres actually people in voice chat in gold which feels great. Usually its like ""hey anyone got comms?""

Its not about stats/ the rank you have displayed. Played on another bronze account just to prove to myself that i was actually where i was supposed to be. Queued with my friend who was also bronze.

VALORANT,2021,1,"Introduction: Aisha is an Indian character. She can be classified as a sentinel, but has initiator aspects to her kit as well. 

Abilities:
Note: keep in mind the numbers are just temp they don’t matter as much as the ability description. Also the names are also the best I could come up with atm.

E (Signature Ability): Akashic One - Aisha equips an Akashic One Anti-Personnel Device, which can be invisibly deployed onto a wall (including objects), thrown on the ground, or equipped on an ally (includes herself). If equipped on an Ally, it mounts itself to the ground near when the ally is dead. An unused Akashic One can be picked up and redeployed instantly, while using 2 abilities on the same device consumes its radianite. (3-4 charges, one per round and 200 gold each for the rest), no recharge. 

C :  Scan/Disrupt - Can be cast instantly on a device. If the selected Akashic One is deployed on a surface (wall, object or ground), it reveals itself while instantly scanning the area and picking up radiant signals in the detection radius, and self destructs in 2 seconds, dealing 50-70 damage in a small radius. (To clarify, it reveals which agents are in the detection radius but not their positions, and it insta ticks just once so you can’t stop it from scanning, but you can shoot and stop it from dealing damage). If the targeted device is instead equipped on an ally, the device partially disrupts radianite, causing it to deal 20% less damage. (20% less damage taken from abilities but also 20% less dealt). 2 charges, 100 gold each.

Q : Dispel - Can be cast instantly on a device. If the selected device is mounted on a surface, it reveals itself and dispels any smokes cast in the area (same radius as detection radius) until the end of the round. If the selected device is on an ally, it makes them immune to the first crowd control effect they encounter. 2 charges, 100 gold each.

X (Ultimate) : Akashic Two Prototype : Equip the Akashic Two Prototype Anti-Personnel Device to an Ally ( takes 1 second animation). For the next 20- 30 seconds, the device makes the ally immune to all crowd control effects, reveals objects/enemies in stealth, and outlines enemies in red. The ally also takes 40% less damage from radianite sources, but deals 40% less as well. In addition, the Akashic Two emits a loud noise (as loud as footsteps on normal ground) every 5 seconds, due to the massive radianite  usage. 7 charges.

Notes: Radianite sources means abilities. Whenever the word ‘allies’ is used, it means Aisha herself as well. She can equip the Akashic one or two onto herself as well. 

Usage examples: After equipping E on an ally, instead of waiting for the person to say ‘I’m blinded’ or ‘they’re pushing’ in comms, you can just use dispel/disrupt on them at the start of the round since they don’t have a timer. Disrupt lasts the whole round and dispel lasts till the first cc effect. You can also deploy it onto walls and stuff so enemies have to look away etc to shoot it after you use Dispel/Scan. Also, the ult can be useful for holding clutch angles, or even post plant if they plan to molly, nade, or dart, etc while you’re defusing.",2021-01-01 23:16:00

This is just a small clip but I'm working on an overedited half-comedic half-project type video as well, which I want to finish with many more skins (currently just have singularity and prime working) and an app that anyone can download and use on their own clips.

I'm doing this with the CycleGAN model and it's really similar to the style transfer stuff you see with filters and things like night to day or summer to winter, etc. Just the style transfer is between a vanilla gun and the gun with some skin.

VALORANT,2021,1,"I know that a lot of people this act were taken down several ranks, making huge downward leaps like going from Gold to Bronze. I was one of these players as well, just like most other people that this happened to, I got extremely tilted. It felt like everything I had been working towards for the past two acts was just swatted aside like it was nothing, and I hated Riot for it. However, as this act is coming to an end, I’m starting to think that it was actually a good thing that I was taken down from gold two to bronze two.

Around the end of last act, I was starting to feel that my in game mechanics were slipping up a bit. I was no longer confident in my skill, and never pushed out or played aggressively, and this mindset pushed me further into the hole, as I wasn’t giving myself opportunities to improve. Once I got demoted to bronze, my feelings of resentment just amplified exponentially, and I couldn’t figure out how to move forward. This is where I got lucky. I had some amazingly supportive higher elo friends, who were able to motivate me to keep playing comp. in addition to that, they reviewed my VODs, and helped me aim train. I followed the regime for a majority of the act, and it helped me make a drastic improvement. As of right now, I am a plat player, which was a rank that I had been seeking since act 1. 

Getting demoted helped me learn how to push myself to constantly keep improving, and if I hadn’t gotten demoted like this, I don’t think I would have ever escaped my plateau. Thanks to this act, I’m more confident in my skills than I ever have been, and I feel like I’m finally making progress.

Some of you may be thinking that you don’t have enough time to play, or that you aren’t allowed to play as much. To those people I say: I only played 1-1 1/2 hours a day. 

TL;DR - getting demoted 6 ranks helped me to push my self to become better, and helped me reach a goal I had been working for since Act 1",2021-01-01 23:39:04

VALORANT,2021,1,"Hello valorant players of reddit. I must say that I'm by no means a good player, I'm just platinum 1, mostly by my poor aim and mechanics. If you find that your pure raw skill is not getting you the rank you feel like you deserve, here are some useful tips I learned on my alt account when playing with lower elo players.

&amp;#x200B;

Pick up a microphone!

the biggest issue i saw in low elo was lack of communication. If you pick up a microphone, it is so much easier to call out information and ideas. If you are too scared to talk to random people you might find the communication wheel useful (found in controls) which can make call-outs such as ""going a!"" or ""fall back"" or ""rotate"" etc. But please don't do any hard backseat gaming, it only frustrates the players alive and is often counterintuitive. 

 If nobody is initiating the push, or it feels as if nobody is taking role as leader, do it yourself.

When on attack, often many players will sit outside of the chokepoint, waiting for something to happen, or just to bait out a teammate and not trading out their death. If you find that you are often suck not pushing, pick up a duelist or initiator and try to start the crossing into site. For example, you can smoke off site lines as jett, and dash into site. Or, you could flash with any flash character, and tell your teammates to push with you. I had to learn the hard way from a solo-based game over to a team game, that you cannot win by yourself but rather through teamwork.

Don't blame teammates for holding you back.  

Your selected teammates are NOT the reason you are being held back. Sure, you may have a game where you have an AFK'er and/or a thrower, but there might be another where you get carried and do little. You need to understand that you are the difference maker between a win and a loss. scolding your teammates for their mistakes often makes them perform even worse and hurts the team moral.

Listen to callouts if given!

Recently, I had played a game where all 4 of my teammates were sitting in garage, not doing anything, because they were being spammed by utility. I noticed that 4 of the 5 players on the enemy team had rotated over, and the 5th had been caught off from flanking. I had called for a rotate, but they proceeded to push in and died one by one. You need to play as a team, rather than trying to do your own thing. However solo-based plays, such as lurking, can be fine as you can communicate with your team that you are distracting enemies from potentially rotating or cutting off the flank.

Instantly mute any disruptive audio or toxicity\~

Toxicity is a huge problem in the low ranks, even iron, surprisingly, and toxic players will bring you down and ruin the team moral. You are stuck with these players for the whole game and instant mutes will keep you from not getting distracted.

Learn from your mistakes.

You may often find that you are doing something every round that may end up in you dying or in a bad position. The best way to fix this is to watch your own gameplay and understand why you died. Maybe you pushing into site lines while your team was unprepared, maybe you fed into another player, or maybe you had bad positioning. All these mistakes can be corrected by learning from them.

There are games that are just out of your control.

Sometimes you may find, no matter how many kills, clutches, or plays you make, the score will not be in your favor. Sometimes teammates will not listen and do their own thing, or throw and leave the game. These are just games out of your control, and they aren't setting you back. However there will be games were it is up to you to be the difference maker of a win or a loss. These are the games that determine where you belong, not games that you lose no matter how much you do, or win for how little you do.

Play together and play for trades when in numbers!

I have seen countless throws in lower elo when players feel as if they have already secured the round, and end up feeding into a 1v4, resulting in the enemy clutching. Just because you outnumber the opponents does not mean you have won the round. Instead, play for trades, as peeking/fighting together may result in 1 teammate dying but securing the kill on the enemy. 

Call for saves and buys accordingly.

If you notice that some teammates cannot buy, call for a half buy, and make sure that everyone can afford to buy in the proceeding round. a full save can be called if nobody can buy (obviously) to make sure that you can all afford next round. You need to make sure you are on the same page as your teammates and you can all buy on a following round.

Find out what caused you to lose a previous round!

You might find that the enemy is abusing a flaw in your team's executes, such as spraying down the whole team with an odin, or flushing out and killing everyone with killjoy's utility. If you find that you are constantly losing to the same stuff, find out a way to counter it. Maybe play close range or flash out an enemy odin user, or headshot them before they have time to spray you down with a rifle. Maybe if you're dying to killjoy utility, try to find where  she places the utility and break it before it has a chance to damage your whole team. Or, a player could flank from a site every round, and you can catch onto that and hold his/her flank. The same goes for your side, if you find that the enemy has no control over an area, take control of it and get behind the enemy lines.",2021-01-02 00:11:25

VALORANT,2021,1,"I think this should only apply to ranked where team composition is a huge factor. Right now, if someone instalocks Reyna/Phoenix/Jett, the whole team changes around them. Anything else you wanted to play was either taken or you had to change because it worked terribly together with the instalocked agent. (I think) if we made it so that you couldn't actually lock in for maybe 30 seconds, it would let the team get their composition together and an actual strat involving all of them made.

I’ll get a game where 2 people will be ‘afk’. They will be unranked, and simply stand in spawn and fire every 2-3 seconds so they don’t get kicked. This has happened probably half a dozen times to me.

The next thing I see a ton is groups of people, presumably playing together, trapping me in corners, taking the spike and hiding with it all round, or doing nothing but trying to knife people all game.

VALORANT,2021,1,"Awhile back the Valorant devs released an in-depth analysis of the current state of the clarity in this game during gunfights in relation to hit registration.

[https://playvalorant.com/en-gb/news/dev/the-state-of-hit-registration/](https://playvalorant.com/en-gb/news/dev/the-state-of-hit-registration/)

Playing deathmatch a lot, the issues remain, pretty glaringly, which is one reason I suspect that they haven't rolled out game replays. 

During many gunfights, you can clearly see and hear gunshots wizzing by you and then you're dead, no getting tagged, no getting one tap headshot'd. Are these people actually spraying and getting the luck of the draw or is it just not showing up on my screen the way it's supposed to?

Let's not forget the running and gunning is perhaps one of the worst things about this game which the devs finally claim to be fixing in one of the upcoming updates. Someone runs around the corner and you're dead. No gunshot noise, no visual. Before anyone say's iT's StRaFiNg. No it's not, and this has been proven so many times. It's used at the tournament level. 

Are you guys aiming away from where the person is on your screen to account for where they actually are from the server's point of view? I don't understand how you're supposed to account for this or are we actually relying on luck?",2021-01-02 04:27:30

VALORANT,2021,1,"although I am in bronze, the teammates I get matched up with always seem kind and friendly, for example, my reyna was clearly new to the game and liked to rush the enemies with a judge and would die, but my teammates would teach him to push together with us and overall we had a great time and we also won that game. To compare this to games like csgo, fortnite, cod, this community is not as heated and is more understanding. Maybe this is different for other people, but this has been my experience in valorant, in the last few matches, I have always used my mic to talk and give comms to them and make sure they don't blame themselves and to not push so much, and in result I have won 5/7 of my ranked matches with 1 draw.",2021-01-02 05:18:56

I had streaks of performing well but It wasn’t enough and I deranked pretty heavily. I feel like the only thing that makes me throw is when I am tilting, and I’m trying to see if the best way to fix this is to try and find a way to stop tilting in general or just manage my tilt better. 


I don’t know if this helps, but the main cause of me tilting is me not playing well, but I usually start off the day by playing poorly, and I want to get to the point where I can play even if I’m starting out pretty badly.

VALORANT,2021,1,"I am hard-stuck in diamond, ive reached a full dorito of imm2 last act rank(act2) but this act as been a downfall for me. i went down to plat 3.... Then trying to go back up is crazy, it feels impossible. i am a duelist main and i focus on entry. I play mostly Reyna and Phoenix, viper only on icebox don't ask me why lol. 

I usually get 20 kills but also 20 deaths. When i win i can be on top of scoreboard but only get 1 arrow up while my teammates gets 2. I also tend to play too much especially when I'm losing. One day i played 15 ranked and lost 12 of them, i guess i like torture but i don't know when to stop...  


i have a match mvp or team mvp ratio of around 40% which is above average. i ever got a full page of mvp regardless of win or loss.

I entry i often feel like my teammates doesn't follow or my smoke main doesn't know what they're doing. some times i do bad and we lose. but whenever i do good its not a guaranteed win. on blitz my win rate overall is 46.3% means I'm losing more than i win...

I feel like if i could shift this win/loss ratio to 50% i would be ranking up for sure because of how well i perform compared to the others.

I also started to rage lately as i feel like every teammates i get are boosted and i don't think I'm that rank(you probably hear that a lot) and the enemy is either smurfing or hacking, or just have better comm and chemistry.

I'm also tired of having teammates that don't talk for a full half then the only thing they say on the mic is (you should have done this).

I don't know what to do i am quite experienced with gaming I've played high competitive level in csgo and i am now 31 years old, maybe i am washed up but i don't wanna believe this.

I know that i am playing too aggressively and get 2 or 3 frags in a round then i proceed to get another one and die then my team crumble, this happens all the time i feel shitty. I push on Defender side while i shouldn't, or i over commit to gun fights.

VALORANT,2021,1,"Rykael-

E ability
Radiant halo
Free/Recharging
Places his halo in a walkway. Enemies that try to walk past it are highlighted and enemies in its range are damaged overtime
Can be shot; but that also highlights the enemy(s) shooting
Bullets cannot be shot past the area surrounding the halo
Once destroyed; the halo makes a b-line back to Rykael very quickly, giving enemies a vague hint at where he is to balance out having their location revealed for destroying it
Damaging range could be the size of an Omen smoke
To place the halo would be similar to placing an Omen smoke as well
10 second cooldown to place again

C ability
Heavenly crescent 
400 credits
Essentially a boomerang that can be thrown and return to the user
2 options when throwing; in a straight line ahead of you, damaging all enemies it passes thru up to 25 meters(or the first wall it hits) and returning even if it doesn’t make contact with an enemy, or thrown so that it curves around a wall, only returning if it makes contact with an enemy
To throw it around the corner of a wall; it could be launched similar to a Breach flash; by aiming at the corner of the wall you wish for it to travel beyond
Can be thrown at 2 different elevations: high or low, the high elevation can be crouched under, the low elevation can be jumped over(to assist players in avoiding being located)
Players hit in the legs with the low throw will be slowed, players hit in the head with the high throw will be concussed -NOTE: there will not be 2 set elevations when thrown straight, the boomerang will simply be aimed and shot with Mouse 1(concussing all enemies hit), while curving the boomerang will be aimed at the corner of a wall and launched with Mouse 2/alternate fire
This will do 50 damage each time it passes thru an enemy
15 second cool down once it’s returned or retrieved
If Rykael pulls out his weapon or tries to throw his halo while the boomerang is traveling; he will not catch it unless he presses E before it returns, but the boomerang will still land at his feet(picked up with E)
Can be retrieved by the end of the round for free usage next round

Q ability
Angelic light
200 credits
2 charges
Rykael uses his divine energy to shine extremely bright flashing enemies and allies in his line of sight for up to 2 seconds
His body will be the source of the flash, he can still move as normal, but he becomes near-sighted, being slightly less affected by the light

X ability/ultimate 
Divine intervention
7 orbs to use
Rykael can fly up and call upon a swarm of locusts; damaging all enemies within an area, and slightly blurring enemies’ vision doing 45 damage over 4 seconds
If there are less enemies alive; more locusts will focus on less targets therefore increasing the overall damage by 10 for each dead opponent
It will take locusts 2.5 seconds to travel from the heavens to the enemies, and enemies outside of a 35 meter radius will no longer be in range and therefore won’t be affected by the continuous swarm
Rykael will be at the center of the swarm; and must stay still in mid air to channel this divine intervention; his position will be marked on the map
He can utilize his weapons and abilities during the Ultimate -NOTE: if there is only 1 enemy left alive; this ability will not available for use that round, as Rykael has a divine Ego and refuses to call upon the heavens for divine intervention to deal with only 1 measly opponent

No skins and no credits to show for it, even my purchase history shows 0$ spent on the Valorant support page. Has anyone else had this issue? and if so what did you do to fix it?

VALORANT,2021,1,"Valorant is the first fps game I've dedicated a relatively large portion of time to. The only significant fps experience I had before this was the 50 hours I clocked on cs. So far, since the official launch of the game, I've racked up around 800 hours on the game and an additional 100 on aim labs. All this has resulted in me achieving a highest rank of platinum 3 (since which I've dropped back to plat 2). I love this game, and really wish to maybe win relating tournaments in the future.

My question is, are these aspirations unfounded? Based on my current trajectory, is there any hope for me achieving at least Immortal by the time the year 2021 ends?

It may sound harsh, but are people really incentivised to change for the better in this game? Chat bans are no threat and permabans are a nuclear option (also easy to notice). Therefore I think, it would be better to introduce a gradual punishment. Something that hurts those more, that hurt others more. Rating and accounting for player-behaviour would increase matchmaking times, but that's a trade I'd do any day. I can wait 5 minutes to find a game, if that leads to having better games.

VALORANT,2021,1,"I understand the limitations that posts like these have and I know that ultimately this decision should be based off of my interests and playstyle but I'd appreciate some guidance and insight into who I should play mainly.

&amp;#x200B;

# Background info:

I am a CS player turned Valorant player. In CS I've gotten up to around A rank on ESEA and around IM in league play. In league play I'm usually 1st AWP or 2nd AWP. In Valorant I am currently Diamond 1. Throughout my Valorant journey so far I've pretty much always waited until my team picked their agents before picking mine. What this means is I've bounced around from duelist to sentinel to initiator pretty much every game. I feel like this has provided me with both positives and negatives when it comes to my game knowledge but now I'm looking into really honing my skills on a specific character.

&amp;#x200B;

# A little bit about my playstyle:

I like OPing in Valorant but my rifling is fine as well. I definitely prefer OPing defense side a lot more than on attack side in contrast to CS where its more balanced. I don't want to be stuck waiting behind my teammates because of the nature of my utility (this is my gripe with Sage). I like having the option of lurking but of course I don't want to lurk every round. I'm comfortable entrying for my team or going in after, however I feel like I'm better suited being alive for late round situations.

&amp;#x200B;

# Misc. information:

When it comes to a main, I'd prefer an agent who I have a decent shot of being able to play most games but this doesn't disqualify any agent. If you can, please provide your 1st and 2nd choices for who you think I should main. I'd also prefer an agent who I don't need to spend a bunch of time learning line ups for (Sorry Sova).

&amp;#x200B;

If you've read this whole thing, thank you. With this information, who do y'all think would fit the bill as my main?",2021-01-02 13:22:59
VALORANT,2021,1,"I noticed that playing a support agent makes more difficult you to rank up. As a main Jett, I am noticing that playing a more passive player hurts you in the rank.

What's the point of playing team support agents if individually it hurts you?

Total Net XP required to complete the ACT 3 Battlepass WITHOUT Epilogue: \*\*1,372,000\*\* XP

Total Net XP required to complete the ACT 3 Battlepass WITH Epilogue: **1,622,000** XP

I'm not sure of how much weeklies are worth, since the last pass had some with less or more XP rewards, rather than a consistent amount per mission per week. While they do have quite a bit of XP for finishing them, with the final set filling out around 75,000 last pass. If anyone knows how the weekly system determines the XP changes, or if its a fixed total distributed differently, or whatever is happening with that (so I can add it into the calculations and see what the true daily XP requirement is), hmu in the replies.

XP Per Match for each Gamemode

Unrated / Competitive: Min **1300** XP, Flawless Win (No Lost Rounds) **3900** XP, Max **5100** XP.

Spike Rush: Fixed **1000** XP

Deathmatch: Fixed **900** XP

Custom Matches: No XP

Conclusion (Oct. 14, 2020): To finish the Battlepass (but not the Epilogue) by the final day, you would need to play one of the following sets every single day (assuming all daily missions are completed, ***and not accounting for weekly missions).***

1. 2 Full Unrated / Competitive matches of which both are tiebreaker wins, plus one match earning at least 1045 XP.
2. 2 Flawless Unrated / Competitive wins and 1 non-flawless match earning **3325**\+ XP.
3. \~11.25 Spikerush matches, assuming Daily Missions do not require gun/shield buying.
4. \~12.5 Deathmatch matches, assuming Daily Missions are completed, something you cannot do without playing other gamemodes, making this technically impossible to do.
5. \~17 Deathmatch matches, assuming Daily missions are not completed.
6. Some combination totaling **11,245** XP. Alternatively **15,245** XP if Daily Missions are not completed within said combination.

I will update this if any XP gain changes are announced, be it tweaks to gain rate, mission rewards, a new gamemode, or anything else that could impact XP gain.

It seems like two winning matches per day seems to be the ideal, with the remaining XP being accounted for by weekly missions and then some, however since winning matches is never a guarantee, and there is no XP buffer system to ensure consistency, this means its also quite a gamble since if you lose matches too often you won't be able to complete the pass without spending in excess of an hour every day on just Valorant (never mind any other interests or hobbies).

Edit 1: Fixed XP total, and tweaked related values to match. Also added an extended conclusion.

Edit 2: Changed the conclusion a bit to emphasize that because I don't know what the weeklies are worth in total or per week, they are not accounted for but are very much there and depending on how much they will be, could make it more practical for someone who does not play daily to complete.

Edit 3: So, I want to add in the new epilogue teirs, but I have no idea what their xp cost is like (and its probably unreasonable for people who don't play Valorant a crap ton).

Edit 4: Deathmatch xp values were tweaked, there is a new temporary snowball fight mode coming out, spike rush's xp reward was also changed, and there are now 5 epilogue teirs with unknown xp costs. None of these are reflected in the above values yet.

Edit 5: Epilogue teirs values added in, added a separate xp total conclusion for doing or not doing the Epilogue.

Edit 6: Fixed xp discrepancy for Epilogue teirs",2021-01-02 14:45:56

Hello people, I share my last video that is a montage of Reyna about what would happen in the mind of a main, the idea is that you have fun with the editions while the ost of the ninja turtles of snes plays in the background. The first part of the video is an intro where you see the community's reaction to the new league of legends champion (Seraphine) and how this led me to change the game and start playing Valorant, then comes an edited gameplay playing Reyna combining the rhythm of the song in the background with the gameplay and quality memes, since in this part of the video I concentrate most of the editing, once the gameplay is finished there is a version of the opening of the anime Blend S but in Valorant version, using instrumental song of this and fitting the voices of Raze, Jett, Killjoy, Reyna and Sage as if they were part of the song, choosing these agents because they are the ones we use with my group of friends and using this version of blend s to introduce clips playing with my friends, this part is not in English but the subtitles are set so that they can translate it into their language.

I hope you like it and support me, from now on my content will be based on Valorant and I am already working on a video with this edition of Jett or Sage.

VALORANT,2021,1,"First of all this is not my problem, I just present a solution to the toxicity that some complain of and Riot having to fix exploits and do balance for deathmatch when they just wanted a simple warm up

I think deathmatch needs to stop showing the scoreboard, kill count and any sort of stats while in the match and remove the killcap to keep it time based. Also when the match is finished, it should only show personal stats only. it seems comparison breeds toxicity on an individual level and a feel of inferiority that causes really bad behaviour and habits that I see people trying to exploit deathmatch respawn to farm kills and camping portals with shotguns, waiting for the sound of you walking away or killing someone else, some weird insecure things that can accumulate and ruin the mode for some people. This suggestion will also increase a player's focus as they only need to think about themselves. No need for someone to whine about a sound or corner camper getting the best score, and no need for the camper to even camp for the kills as there's no one to compare to. Pure solitude.

Now my real desire here is this:

If it's also 15 mins with faster respawn, it would be prefect warmup for me.",2021-01-02 16:25:16

VALORANT,2021,1,"During 9 months, I play this game with standard frog ADSL connection, which is :

* ping between 50ms and 90ms.
* download bandwidth of 12Mbps
* upload bandwidth of 0.8Mbps

Wired ethernet and no wifi activated (exlusive internet).

I did have a lot of ping spikes (like +400ms during 3 seconds and multiple times per game).

On top of that, game wasn't always smooth. In some games, I could not react at all when the enemy was peeking. It's like the enemy was prefering with wallhack (which obviously was not the case 99% of the time). I had to shoulder peek or wide swing every time, never taking direct lines (even broken ones) and pray that the surprise effect will be enough.

In some games, it did work just fine, but it wasn't the majority of my games.

It's what I called the ""desync"" feeling. Not even sure if there is a real technical issue behind this word... I don't think so.

Since 3 weeks, I got fiber connection :

* ping between 20ms and 40ms
* download bandwidth of 380Mbps
* upload bandwidth of 150Mbps (at least)

**This is not the same game !**

I don't have the desync feeling anymore, no more ping spikes, I manage to do insane flicks which never succeeded before (because of ping I presume). My game is the same than Twitch streams.

My conclusion is that the game is heavily dependant of network conditions.

The game seems to be really harder with ping above 40ms and low upload bandwidth. Maybe there is a desync issue which is occuring after a ping spike. I don't know.

I wanted to share my experience. If you got poor networkd conditions and you don't understand how you've been rekt that hard in some games, you may experience the same issue than me. You still can improve and win though.

Now, I don't have any more excuse and I'm fine with that. I never experience ""unfair"" death anymore.

EDIT : I did not want to compare games in the first place but I have no choice because of some comments. I played csgo for 6 years with the first connection, and I played a lot on FaceIt too, which has 128 tick servers. I never experienced ping spike, and I never been disadvantaged that hard by my connection. And I had worst ping too (80-90ms minimum). The desync feeling or peekers advantage has never been an issue. So the title should be : **the games depends much more of internet conditions than other games.**",2021-01-02 20:20:50

I would not be nearly as bothered by this however if I wasnt previously stuck at silver 2 peaking silver 3, but over about 2 days I kept losing matches and now am all the way down at bronze 2. I definitely feel I don't deserve to be down here and I keep getting terrible teamates and I keep top fragging, so I dont feel like im improving or having much fun.

VALORANT,2021,1,"This would be an awesome way to give players occasional opportunities to rotate their skins without spending the extra cash and stockpiling skins for the same weapon. It also fits well with the night (/black) market theme!

Surely Riot has more data than I do here, but I can imagine this being a win-win for them as well, particularly as the pool of skins continues to grow. This ends up acting similarly to the steam market where volvo takes a cut of each transaction between players, and I think would incentivize players to get more skins (*spend more) in the long-term. At least for me, there's definitely a bit of psychological barrier when considering buying a second weapon skin, as it feels wasteful. Having the simultaneous option to buy the skin at a discounted rate also would make me feel better about selling at a loss.

I vaguely recall an interview with a Riot dev where they mentioned eventually providing some way to sell back skins, maybe they already had the intention of eventually doing this? The night market definitely feels incomplete and smells of agile development 😝",2021-01-02 20:48:29

VALORANT,2021,1,"Just wondering whether you guys think the state of ranked in this game is good or not right now, personally I think it's absolutely terrible. I have been the same rank forever and I consistently  get match mvp while helping my team and never being toxic, but the other team is just smurfs after smurfs. Also what's the point of the rank gap limit for friends if an iron can be in a silver lobby when you queue, and you can't rank up after 5 3 arrow mvp wins but one 0-13 makes you derank, curious as to if many others seem to agree, or if most of you think the ranked system is good right now?

VALORANT,2021,1,"I forget how many actual games I've seen have this, but I've run this through a lot of my friends and they agreed on it being a good start to an idea at least.

Now for what I'm thinking here. I am a peak gold 3 and even in silver and gold, hell even plat lobbys, I've had people smurfing at least once every 5 games. Sometimes on my team. (as someone who finds solo que better than with others) I've often run into 4-5 stacked smurfs or trolls. You know what those accounts aren't? Their mains. I think that you should have to have a phone number verification to play comp, or require way more games to play comp. The problem with the second option is that accounts made beforehand would still be active and capable of playing. 

Now this might sound unappealing to a lot of people but, I have 3 alt accounts. Currently I have 2 brought up to at least bronze 3 and play on them when I'm not doing as well as I'd like. The other is an iron 3 account. Also my first ever account. When I'm on there it's normally either 4am or to play with my iron friends. I refuse to carry them tho so I'll try to sit middle frag and help more through communication than through just straight demolishing the other team (as people playing in a lower rank to play with their friends should) 

One thing my friends brought up is possibly having a limit of accounts linked to a number. Like 2 or 3 accounts to a number and such. Only problem with this number verification is that I don't know if riot would be able to get permission or even be allowed to implement something like this at all. I'm relatively new to the whole fps gaming scene having only joined in June when valorant fully released so I know very little about the limitations of games like this.

Now obviously there is always going to be a work-around to stuff like this (such as fake phone numbers) but I think if nothing else, it would reduce the amount of 6-10 year olds in our games. (Yes I've run into a 6 y/o) I feel like there needs to be something that eliminates or at least lessens the amount of smurfs and alts in the game. I feel like eliminating them from the comp scene would leave the rankings looking much more accurate as well, seeing less iron 1 accounts.

I apologize if this is all over the place I didn't plan this out I kind of just wrote as I went and I never really did very well in English. Anyway anything that gets this seen by more people is much appreciated!",2021-01-02 21:44:49
VALORANT,2021,1,"Just wanted to share this for anyone new to the game because I have seen a lot of new people run from the bomb during the second tick or something cause they thought they had no time.

Spike Detonation - 45 seconds since bomb plant

Spike Defusal - 7 seconds

First tick is 25 seconds, meaning this is the time to rotate/decide to go for it or save/gather info and start making your move

Second tick is 10 seconds, meaning you should start picking up your pace if you have committed to the retake and probably start defusing (try to get it half way, etc)

Third tick is 5 seconds, meaning you HAVE to start defusing or else you won't have enough time

4th tick is 5 seconds, meaning you will have no time to defuse if you aren't already defusing during the 3rd tick

The bomb takes 7 seconds to defuse.

While I can smoke of many heaven windows like, split b (toxic orb), heaven a (toxic orb), bind a (toxic orb), split a (toxic screen), the only useful change I see here with respect to toxic orb is to retract it similar to Killjoy retracting her bots.
As for her toxic screen, many times enemies never respect this as it barely does any damage (negligible). Hence enemies passing the toxic wall either take permanent damage similar to Phoenix blaze wall, or get vulnerable status. None of that wall retraction bs, which will make her broken.

Another idea although it may seem broken is not to revert decay damage, unless in vipers pit.

VALORANT,2021,1,"I know its a little late and I'm not sure if anyone made a post on this already but I have a theory that the night market has a predetermined roll based not on RNG(random number generator) but on whether the account owner is someone who has already did microtransactions in the game.

First, I admit that this is just a theory based on anecdotal evidence my main and alt account(not smurf just don't want ppl to know I'm online sometimes lol) and and people on my friends list but I have come to the conclusion that people who spent money on the game( doesn't matter the amount) were less likely to get higher tier cosmetics in their night market. 

Now I can understand that if you have alot of skins then their is less good skins for you to get in the shop in the first place, but for most ppl that isn't the case. I have a decent amount of skins, mostly 875-1275 along with a prime and oni, yet I only got blue and green in mine, other friends in my situation shared similar results. But on my alt and friends who didn't spend money on the game were more likely not just to get a higher skin but more spots of higher skins. So  if this is true, why is this a problem and why would Riot do that. 

The issue with something like this is that you are potentially being gatekept from a discount market that everyone has the access to because Riot wants to entice people, who don't normally spend money on microtransactions, to make their first purchase because statistically once you have broken the ""microtransactions on a free game barrier""  you're more likely to continue to spend more money. But for someone who has previously spent money on the game you wouldn't be the target of this, **and since they know that you're already willing to purchase microtransactions at full price, why give it to you at a discount?** It's a win/win for them at the end of the day tbh. And If this is the case than that is kinda messed up in my opinon but it's there company at the end of the day but they could be just open about a system of discounts for new players or something idk. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Again This is just a theory.**  I admit the flaws in this but I posted this was hoping for smart redditers to fill in the holes or for Riot to respond I guess.",2021-01-03 01:10:47

VALORANT,2021,1,"Currently, if you disconnect for a minute and reconnect you'll get a 10 minute timeout the first time, an hour timeout the second time, and a 2 hour timeout the third time. I think this is how it works anyway.

To play in ranked games initially you must win 10 unranked games.

My idea, while playing ranked games, is to replace the 10 minute timeout with a requirement to win 2 Spike Rush games. Replace the 1 hour timeout with winning 1 unranked game, and so on. 

If you disconnect in an unranked game, replace the timeouts with winning a certain number of Spike Rushes before you can play unranked again. If someone disconnects in Spike Rush, require them to play out a Deathmatch or two.

This way there are consequences for disconnecting and you can still play Valorant. It should also be relatively simple to implement since the devs can reuse the code they already have for playing Ranked games initially. Lastly, if it's someone's last match of the day a timeout is not a deterrent, but the requirement to win an Unranked game or Spike Rush would carry over.

Do you think this would be an improvement over the current system?",2021-01-03 02:06:04

VALORANT,2021,1,"Name: Tempest

Role: Initiator

Signature: 1 charge. 40s.

Sunny Day- Immediately Throw a small device. Once it hits the ground, it creates a small radius that eliminates any smoke touching it for 2 seconds. Only a chunk of a Viper Pit gets removed with this. Viper Poison Orb and Wall get turned off for 2 seconds.

Ability 1: 2 charges. 200 creds.

Lightning Bolt- Equip a tactical map. Primary fire on the map to mark an area. Secondary Fire to summon a lightning bolt on that area that charges for .75s then crashes down, flashing everyone who looks at it for 1.5s. If an enemy is 4m or less away from it, they get flashed for 2.2s.

Ability 2: 1 charge. 200 creds.

Tidal Zone- Throw a small ball of water. After it lands it starts a small channel on that spot for 1.5s. After the channel it creates a small zone of water that reduces ground damage pools (Brimstone Molly, Phoenix Fire, Viper Snake Bite) by 80% for 3 seconds.

Ultimate: 7 charges.

Heaven Rain- Summon a large storm radius that gives enemies that walk through it slight Wavy Vision. This lasts 10s. During the storm, 5 random Lightning Bolts come striking down in the radius.",2021-01-03 02:22:00

VALORANT,2021,1,"https://mobile.twitter.com/niiicolo/status/1184400033631866880?lang=en This tweet has caused so much controversy. I don’t play overwatch, well, because with most of the characters, abilities matter way to much. I don’t play CSGO anymore because there is no utility mixing up. It’s all just smokes flashes and Molotovs. I played valorant because it looked like most of killing abilities were really easy to avoid, and punished you for being out of position, and not for playing the game. Then I played against a Raze for my first time. I personally find it quite annoying the Raze’s grenades don’t match their visual very much, and going far away and getting hit by it, even though you didn’t think you were in it. Raze doesn’t punish you for being out of position, she simply punishes you for playing the game. I don’t think she’s overpowered, just really annoying. If they were to maybe make the visuals of the grenade match it a little more, I’d be happy, and not being getting tiled going from 150 hp to 130 when I’m 10 meters away. At least it’s not as bad as the beta Raze.",2021-01-03 02:49:20

VALORANT,2021,1,"Just an idea I had - 

Often you get into a game of comp, and immediately 4 duelists are instalocked. This often results in dodging (or just an overall unfun/lost game as you have an awful teamcomp)

A sort of solution for this would be to allow your team to vote to reset agent selections on your team, (needs 3 votes/5 players eg, kind of like a surrender vote) which would force everyone to reselect their agent.

Otherwise, it could also be solved by just forcing you to be unable to select agents for the first 15 or so seconds of competitive so that you can discuss team composition.

Of course, the real solution to instalocking is to force people to be able to confidently play multiple agents, so that they can flex to a good team composition, but I don't know how that would be achieved.",2021-01-03 03:14:10

VALORANT,2021,1,"Q1: What is Elo Hell?

A: It is where you perform well but are still unable to rankup from say Iron to Bronze

Q2: Isn't Elo hell just an excuse?

A: No, it's not. Elo hell does exist. A number of factors exist for why Elo Hell is apparent. Smurfs, toxicity, bad comms, bad crosshair placement, bad game sense, and so on

Q3: What is the main factor of Elo Hell?

A: From personal experience it's comms. While smurfs are there, in my opinion(and strictly opinion) comms contribute much more. In games like Valorant, if there is no communication, then there aren't callouts, which leads everyone basically 1v5ing because there is no communication. While pings and chat are helpful, they sometimes will not be able to relay the information

Q4: Where is Elo Hell most apparent?

A: It all really depends. Iron, Bronze, and Silver are the biggest elo Hell epicenters. It gets progressively harder to rank up as you go from iron to bronze to silver as the skill gap widens. But that doesn't mean Elo Hell doesnt exist in the higher ranks. There are hardstuck plat and gold players but Elo Hell is most apparent in the lower ranks, especially Iron and Silver

Q5: What is a way to get out of Elo Hell

A: Don't be toxic as even if one player dc's or afk's, it will result in something always bad. Do callouts even if your teammates aren't, be encouraging, offer advice without appearing condescending. Reflect on your own mistakes before blaming others

VALORANT,2021,1,"I’ve been iron 3 for about 4 months (edit: 5 and a half). Today, I got promoted and won my first five games so far. Most of my team is bronze every time.

My aim isn’t even that good today. My dm scores weren’t great today and I’m taking longer on 50 bots, plus my hands are really cold and I’m missing shots I would normally hit. I still was always 3rd or higher in my team.

I think iron just has too many afks, trolling teammates, smurfs, and people who just don’t know what they were doing. Once you finally escape it, I think skill starts to matter a lot more (i did this by playing cypher and sorta kinda baiting my bad teammates/being second guy in). I’m just a bronze after all, so I don’t know if it was luck, “using” my team, or me just carrying that finally got me up, but I’m guessing it’s just cross your fingers and try your best to carry until you get it.

Can anyone confirm if this is how they got out, or is there some other way? Youtube guides all said to carry so I wanted to compare and see if there were other ways.

VALORANT,2021,1,"I think the main reason this happened was because I would have my crosshair at head level, then I would pull down + crouch which brought it down to body level. This obviously wasn't working, so I switched it up a bit. I switched my crouch key to C so that if I needed it for something else it was there but my instant-crouch muscle memory would go away. At first it was really difficult, I kept wanting to keep pulling down until my crosshair was where it used to be, but over time I adjusted. I played 5 deathmatches, and won 2 of them. My aim was easily 3x better than it was before. My deathmatch score reflected that was well. I was able to tap fire confidently, now that it was actually reliable and it would land on their head. I could kill them way faster than before. My movement was better because I could adjust without the crouch speed penalty. All in all, I plan on keeping it like this for a long time to really work it in with how much improvement I've seen. I suggest a lot of you should too.",2021-01-03 06:18:12

VALORANT,2021,1,"As a sage main, I feel like it is necessary for me to post this.

1. If you get healed by a sage, stay out of combat so the orb can last the entire duration which heals you for the 60.

2. There is a 45s cool down so if you see someones health start rising all of a sudden, chances are the sage has healed someone else so  they can’t heal you for a while.

3. Because of the 45s cool down, if you have only taken a small amount of damage, Im not going g to waste a heal on that.

4. If the sage has a revive available, the current situation might not be a good circumstance to revive you, so they shouldn’t revive you.

E.g. if it is a 1v5 we are probably going to lose this round even if the sage revives you. There are multiple enemies nearby who could kill us both before we can react. If it’s a 4v1 we are probably going to win that round anyway so it would also be a waste.

5. This might sound selfish but if a duelist and the sage is on 40 health, the sage should prioritise healing herself over the duelists. Once the sage heals herself she has an extra 60 health which could enable them to retreat and provide support for the team while waiting for the cooldown so they can heal you afterwards.

6. A dead sage has much more of an effect on a team than a dead duelist, so protecting the sage is more important than protecting a duelist..

7. Also sentinels kit don’t allow them to get out of a sticky situation unlike how a initiator typically has flashes, a controller can use smokes or a duelist can make getting the kill or get out of the situation easier with their abilities.

Thank you for reading what many people who don’t play sage lack the knowledge of, and can make the life of a sage player so much easier and more enjoyable.",2021-01-03 06:47:09

VALORANT,2021,1,"I don't have stable WiFi (It's alright so my ping isn't the problem), so I would get disconnected a lot randomly. Usually it's just a random disconnect and my internet is still fine, but there's no reconnect button so every time I have a hiccup I'm forced to restart the game every time because the only option is exit. This also applies to the battle pass section, everything would work fine but the battle pass won't reconnect after finishing a match so if I want to see where I'm at in the battle pass, I have to restart.

  
I know ""Get better internet"" is a solution, but come on. I'm not a programmer but I think adding a reconnect button to the menu of the game wouldn't be that hard nor take that much time. Plus not everyone can get better internet so some people will still have this problem.

Now I’m not going to say I’m the best player, but I wouldn’t call myself bad. I guess I’d say it’s safe to call myself pretty average. I originally played in NA and was hovering around Gold 3/Plat 1, teetering back and forth between the two pretty consistently. Recently due to some work changes, I’ve started playing in SEA, and after finishing my unrated matches and getting ranked, I was honestly shocked to get Bronze 3. Don’t know if it’s just the region or if it’s the end of the act, but holy heck is ranked a whole lot different over here. I’m playing silver 1s with gold/plat act ranks and that doesn’t seem too normal.

VALORANT,2021,1,"So, in the battlepass the banner that leaks the next agent is at the 38th level, I think.
This looks like a thing from space, and it will probably be another radiant imo.
So, Reddit, I present you my idea, Astra

Astra
Homeland: Italy
Type: controller
1st ability: Nebula (2 charges)
Once equipped, main fire to cast a smoke at crossair position. Alt fire to dissipate the smoke.
2nd ability: Pulsar (2 charges)
On cast summons an object that damages for 30 every second in an area of 4 m around it, can be shot, resulting in an explosion that deals 60 damage to enemies closer than 2 m.
3rd ability (signature ability): Black Hole (1 charge, reloads with 2 kills or 40 seconds)
Once equipped, main fire to cast an object that attracts enemies and enemy utility, duration 3 seconds. If cast inside a smoke dissipates the smoke.
Ultimate: Astral Projection (7 charges)
Astra leaves her body behind and has 10 seconds to find an enemy in a range of 75 m. If the enemy is caught Astra gains control of the enemy's body for 12 seconds and can shoot the enemy's teammates. To balance this, the possessed enemy can look through the eyes of Astra, but he will only be able to walk very slow (Sage slow orb slow) and see like he was affected by paranoia (spike rush paranoia). The only way to end the possession before the 12 seconds is to kill Astra's real body or to kill the possessed player. Killing the player will result in 2/3 of the actual damage being reflected on the possessed player and 1/3 on Astra.
The player could also be muted during this phase but it may be too OP.

VALORANT,2021,1,"So before I start, I'm talking from personal experience, my friends' experiences and some speculation here.

I actually like this game, but I only play about two/three game every other month. Why's that? 

I'm currently Iron (deservedly, I'm pretty bad at shooters), and every time I try to play competitive  in order to improve or at least enjoy a balanced match I end up having to sit through a lobby full of people who are CLEARLY not playing on my level.

Not saying I'm facing Radiant smurfs every time (don't think I've ever met one at all), but overall decently skilled players playing in a lobby with people who can barely even aim.

I'm not trying to make an argument about whether or not I'm encountering smurfs or just people popping off. I know how mid/high level gameplay looks like (couple friends play competitive CSGO) and that's exactly what I'm seeing in my games. 

Also, I'm not talking about a one-off thing, I encounter these scenarios **every single game**.

I'm not **THAT** bad at shooters, but I recognize I'm not good and I'd like to be able to play competitively with people with the same average skill, though it seems impossible.

No matter the circumstances, there's always two to three players actually playing the game and a bunch of meat shields (me included) hoping we get to participate.

The exact same applies for most of my friends who tried the game. Everyone of us except for the ones that came in with solid fps skills just abandoned it. I'm willing to say that this applies to a lot more people who just can't be bothered to queue in order to get clapped/do absolutely nothing and win.

I wish ranks had more overall balance so I could at least play and feel like I'm winning/losing in fair terms, that would do wonders on me and I'd be playing a lot more.",2021-01-03 11:10:44

VALORANT,2021,1,"Hey everyone,

I just wanted to make a quick post about a recent purchase of mine, as I bit the bullet and bought the sovereign sword off the night market for 37% off. I know that a lot of people wanted this item and the fact that I was able to get it for cheaper made it clear that this was a good deal. Afterwards I realized that I still payed 2000 valorant points for it and was confused as to how expensive this stuff actually is. Like I could have extended my battle pass for two acts for the same price.

VALORANT,2021,1,"The way I see it Brimstone specializes in site executes and spike denial. His abilities all mesh together well except for one. Stim beacon. Although I don't think these ideas particularly mesh with his other abilities I do think it brings more use and viability to Stim beacon. I think stim beacon could use some buffs or even a rework in order to give Brimstone that push he needs.

Idea 1: adding more stats to combat stim while effected you get +25 temporary HP and maybe even a 25% increase in speed. (along with the normal buffs already given by combat stim) I think the +25 temporary HP would be the main use of this ability. These 2 extra buffs would make the effect much more blatant and noticeable as well as be helpful. The 25 extra health although temporary can be the difference between life and death. The 25 HP can't be replenished by the same stim beacon and with vanish once the effect runs out.

Idea 2: permanent station. Stim beacon would be a station that lasts until the death or until destroyed and has one use per player. Team members can go up to the beacon and press F/their interact key in order to activate a boost. the buffs would include 25% increase in speed and normal combat stim buffs.

idea 3: I've seen quite a few people say it should boost defuse/plant time. This could be hard to make balanced but if done properly could probably be a really good buff. but I don't see it happening.

I don't think idea 2 really fits Brimstone as much and might instead be a really cool idea for a new agent. However, it would make Brimstone more useful on defense and more useful in more situations all together. with idea 2 allowing for slightly faster rotates or flanks and having it so people can use it when they want with it being a building. Idea 2 is neat but sounds like a new agent. Maybe a new agent who can place support buildings although that might be a strange edition or even an entirely different game.  


edit: idea 4. stim beacon debuffs enemies who enter it's radius. could slow down enemies like slow orb. This would give you more time to use utility on defense and would combo well with ultimate.  
and if that isn't strong enough then it could also slow down plant/defuse time. The minus defuse time would also help further cement his role as anti-defuse post plant situations.  


idea 5: at one point i was thinking of having it just become a portable health pack but I don't think it fits him.  


bonus (got from commenter [M\_r\_Ra\_in\_7](https://www.reddit.com/user/M_r_Ra_in_7/):   
an idea that applies to all ideas would be to have it be activated like a cypher smoke.

of course only 1 out of these would be added these are all just options and ideas. not all of these at once of course. idea 1 seems like the most likely option. Ideas are ideas either way.  


TDLR; stim beacon doesn't combo well with other abilities could use buff. here are ideas for possible buffs.  
1. add more stats to combat stim (faster speed or +25 temporary HP)  
2. making it a permanent station that can be activated with the interact button once per player.   
(or make it like cypher cage)  
3. increase plant/defuse time  
4. debuffs enemies (slows their speed or even plant/defuse as well)  
5. portable health pack (I dislike this one)  
6. make it activated like a cypher smoke

only one or two of these buffs be added of course. If all were added that would be wack.",2021-01-03 13:06:17
VALORANT,2021,1,A Commentary about my Life of Iron in Valorant (pt 3),2021-01-03 13:06:25
VALORANT,2021,1,"I haven't played Valorant in a while and I've been binging it for a few days. Everytime I finish the ""weekly"" challenges with high rewards I'll just get new ones instantly.

VALORANT,2021,1,"As someone who changes their crosshair every time they die, I think the game could use some additional crosshair options. 

First: An option to disable outline overlapping. Essentially this would just put the actual crosshair lines as a layer above the outline layer, so they outlines never overlap the actual crosshair.

It would take a crosshair like this

https://preview.redd.it/en8irfuvd4961.png?width=996&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0acbf77fd9ff5db8db0fa423df269dadca226fe0

And make it into this

Another option I would like to see added is an rgb slider of some sort for customizing the color. The current system is functional but most other games do have an rgb function and it's just something I would like to see implemented.

The last option I want to talk about is the separation of the dynamic crosshair gap and the firing/movement error option. When you enable firing/movement error, the crosshair gap moves how it should with those options enabled, but it also increases and decreases based on what gun (or knife) you are holding out. In CS:GO these options are separated and it really bothers me that I can't just have firing error on, but I must have dynamic crosshair gap on as well.

VALORANT,2021,1,"Name: Vex

Artstyle: Ringmaster-ish

Role: Controller

1st Ability: deployable mirror (attach to walls, ceiling, floor) that follows the physics of a mirror and can be broken just like the glass at ascent would (gunshots, nades, jett smokes, etc.) around 2x2 meters

2nd Ability: balloons that can be deployed within a certain radius (around 3 charges) and when shot or damaged once, explodes into a mini floating smoke (different colors would be nice) lasts \~6-8 seconds

3rd Ability: Tossing a ring that can bounce off walls and floors (similar trajectory as brimstone's molly but stronger bounce) when it hits an enemy, they are forced to stand but can still aim and shoot, single target, 2 charges maybe, lasts 1.5 seconds, and can only be reused 5 seconds after the 1st cast

Ultimate: Throws a disk that lands on the floor and enlarges and makes the floor spin (can be used to reveal enemies who are holding an off-angle or reveal their location by forcing them to run to stay in place, if they stand still, the disk will carry them maximum of a full rotation in 4 or 5 seconds

(the durations might need some changing, but I think its new and balanced enough)  
(if this is a bad agent design, I suggest the next map to have mirrors :D)

VALORANT,2021,1,"I warmed up in dm for 30 minutes to start the morning off with ranked. Then I queue up and someone dodges for 3 games in a row. Then the 4th game, some guy with streamer mode says ""oh it's 'theguy', he's throwing"". We've all picked already and then the person starts to say theguy threw his last game. So he should dodge right? Nope, he picks an agent instead. So for a whole 25 min we have this brimstone (theguy) sitting in spawn every round and baiting the whole team.

The person in streamer mode (not the thrower) keeps saying shit and whining in all chat like ""I don't care lul"", ""I already got my act rank triangle I could care less"", ""We aren't ffing because I'm not a loser"". He proceeds to get less kills than the brimstone who's afking and trolling. So here I am thinking to myself, this guy is literally as bad as the thrower on our team. This was diamond-plat elo btw.

Tl;dr. A person in agent select tells us one of our teammates was throwing games. He proceeds to still pick anyways and whines in chat, telling the enemies our locations and shit. He doesn't even surrender and does worse than the thrower even.",2021-01-03 15:54:01

VALORANT,2021,1,"First off, I want to start off by saying that this isn't a complaint post at all, the character models and graphics are great the way they are.

But sometimes when I see the character art I wish that the 3D models in game were also modeled after the posters. Some characters are drawn with better proportions and are just drawn in a much more aesthetically pleasing and cartoonish manner. I don't know how to explain it but in the art the characters are drawn in a more, polygonal style? 

This type of art style would allow the character designers to go to town on these character models without messing up the hitbox, as they are able to give characters more distinctive features and faces. Plus, I have never done 3D design in my life before so correct me if I am wrong (I probably am) but it would be easier to design characters in that style. 

It's not that the character design in-game is bad in of itself, the style isn't even bad, but I feel like they could've given the agents a better style, setting them apart from the way that character models are designed in other games.

Here are a bunch of comparisons, between the agents in-game counterparts, and their counterparts in official art and in cinematics.

VALORANT,2021,1,"Hello,

I decided to write a little guide on how to climb, after seeing a lot of my friends being stuck in ""low"" elos even though they have a lot of experience in shooters.  
This is NOT meant for new players, so I'm not covering aim training etc. I'll just say this game is much more about crosshair placement then raw aim for most agents so be sure to work on that if you're new.

I played Valorant quite a bit during beta, then had 12 wins in Act 1 and 13 wins in Act 2. I was Plat/Diam playing mostly 5 stacks with people from Discord communities that I didn't know. I came back for Act 3 and just reached Imo 2 in around 30 wins in Solo Queue.

&amp;#x200B;

1. **Killing is easy, but so is dieing**  
One of the most common mistakes I see from experienced players giving a shot at Valorant, is not taking the game seriously. They think they're this beast and will take risks for no reason. Killing in Valorant is much more easier than CS:GO for example, but so is dieing. Basic teamplay, timing are required to prevent enemies from winning an otherwise easy win for you
2. **Don't queue together unless you're going to use that advantage**  
The game will always reward you with how much you give. If you're playing duo, please take crossfires and hold your site smartly together. If you're playing in 5 stack, be sure to communicate clearly and take advantage of being together on vocal, which should be more than basic communication that could be done on the game's VOIP. If you're just going to play as you would in solo, then just solo queue because others will take advantage of being stacked.
3. **Never blame a teammate**  
**This is probably the MOST important point, as it will condition your teammates' and your own performance.**  
Blaming a teammate is a really easy way to not face your own mistakes. It will also create a really bad mood in the team and chances are the whole team will start to underperform. You might start to perform better because you're falsely confident you're better than them, but you'll just end up frustrated and lose.  
The best way to consistently rank up and have your mates perform at their maximum is to give any useful information, and when you die only focus on your own mistake. You just died after killing 3 guys ? The only question that should come to your mind is ""what should I have done to kill the 4th, or at least not die""  
If you notice your teammates are doing ""stupid"" mistakes, instead of being angry at them, ask yourself ""Do I do the same mistake ?"" ""What is the appropriate play in that situation ?""
4. **Agent selection**  
I would advise to only play one agent at a time. This will allow you to fully master him and think about other aspects of the game. You can't focus on everything at a time and thinking about how to use your spells will just slow you down. I also advice changing agents once in a while to understand other aspects of the game and find what fits you best.  
Changing agents can happen with your mood, but also when you reach new ceilings. I used Jett to climb and now I play almost only Brimstone because my sensitivity is too low to play Jett and I don't have the required APM to get everything she can give. I had to accept that I won't carry games in this elo as I could in lower elos, so I have to use my personal capacities to help my team with the best agent for me.

Solo Queue is probably the best way to climb up the ladder. The biggest challenge you'll face is to accept where the game placed you and **only focus on your own mistakes**. It's easy to blame others but it will never make you improve. This is especially true for players coming from other games that believe they should be higher but make a lot of mistakes due to overconfidence.",2021-01-03 16:59:44

That sent, the worst of the 3 (sage, due to current meta power level). That initiator, tied for best which is why Sova is seen almost as much as duelists among smurfers.

If riot made different agents available prior to unlocks it will directly impact team comps and how the rest of game flows after. Games can be won and lost in the agent pick screen, not so much due to utility (even tho that is a big part) but due to team work. This channel showcases how many people dislike instalock duelists and how that mentality fucks up a team, this can all be mitigated if more non duelist agents are available from the get go",2021-01-03 17:17:54

[ Agent 15 of the Valorant Protocol ID card \(bottom right is the Valorant Protocol symbol with the ID number\) ](https://preview.redd.it/7lh5b4bjh5961.jpg?width=142&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a342e68d8f98d17419eb75c236ccc1fcd9b424a2)

In the Lore of the game the story is moving forward and each agent joining the Valorant Protocol is classified with an ID card number... so for example Brimstone was first to join as Agent 01 and Yoru was currently last as Agent 15.

[Agent origins](https://preview.redd.it/1mv7z8fqh5961.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e3b978892b7726170b5f6182f0124e0537945c03)

Yoru is somehow connected to the Samurai we have seen on Icebox and from what we gathered in the battlepass it seems like he is a descendant of the samurai and came to rescue the armors hence the name ""uninvited guest"".

[ Yoru Title in game ](https://preview.redd.it/7owu5fvvh5961.png?width=713&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1755743a3b11b87fd228ea91f977be21086af493)

(This ""uninvited guest"" title is also a reference to the ""intruder alert"" sign on icebox! (He is the intruder))

If we are wrong about ""Yoru"" being a descendant of the Samurai he might have time traveled since we do know that Icebox is located on Bennett island in Russia in the arctic circle and around the year 1800 when this ancient Japanese is from there should have been no other way of getting to icebox unless with ""Radianite Rifts""

wormholes are Rifts between space and time in physics so this is one way of the ancient Japanese ship being able to get to Icebox

VALORANT,2021,1,"Hello together,

this possibly only affects Odyssey G9 Users, but also everyone who has issues to Play FullScreen Valorant without cutting corners (like 10Bit, 240Hz OC Modes etc.) on their 32:9 Panels.

since i own an Odyssey G9 i can only talk for that monitor, but it always bothered me Valorant won't run in ""Fullscreen"" while in 240Hz Mode, also the Windowmode with Bars and hiding the taskbar didn't cut it for me. So i tinkered around a bit and found a simple Windowresize would work with Valorant anyway, so i decided to include it here. There are manual ways to achieve this, there is no need to do it THIS way, but it works.

I choose AutoIT since it's more readable for any kind of user, - i include the Source here for everyone to compile it themselves, for everyone else there is an .exe to download.

Instead of Valorant just launch the .exe

What it does: Change your Game to Windowed and centered, then Resize to Fullscreen while keeping the 16.9 Aspectratio. It's technically still windowed mode and you loose the 1-2% ""performance"" but i guess everyone who is using a G9 will have hardware to run it anyway...

It gives you the Option to just Resize the Window (if you run Valorant manually first and have it open already in a Window) So it wont look for the Files inside your System if you do not want that...

since this Thread won't let me Post links....please check the Topic i made on Reddit UltraWideMasterRace.

1) Replay System!!! (highlights csgo) spectating  friends while waiting and just learning from mistakes. Must have!! 

2) skins in this Game make no sense for Agents IMO but similiar what they did with gloves in csgo, we could have smth like this in Valorant! 
Rings, watches, gloves, think outside of the Box!! Imagine a legendary watch for 20 Bucks in the Store ... idk id buy this over a cartoony Phantom... how bout you? 

3) Clash!!!! I know this is coming but it cant come soon enough! 
For those unaware, its a 5v5 Tournament Mode which rewards you with Special Stuff and skins  in league of Legends! 

4) Maps, Maps, Maps, Maps and Map queue! There are maps That are just bad... Developed badly and the Community has Spoken... give us the option to deselect the ones we do Not wish to Q for! 

5) Game Modes!!!! Search and destroy is Fine but Imagine what new Modes Could be Invented!! The possibilities ... even smth similar to Overwatch‘s payload Maps would be sick! 

6) Pick and Ban for ranked! If we have a large champion pool!! (+30 champs) 
Let’s face it, agents will come every year, every season and more frequent than maps! Obviously they will not be balanced at the start so give us the option to ban 1,2 agents at the start of a ranked game! Especially with new agents being picked in ranked! This is a huge league of legends problem! 

7) In game Store! Why the fk has noone done this yet? I want to see a Store in Game, where I can see the skins, try the skins on and shoot some bots before I purchase them for 100 bucks! All virtual! I want an ingame store section I can walk in and hang out!!! 

Make this an experience and you will make more money than you can Imagine! 

have a wonderful 2021 and let’s not be toxic to another! 



EDIT: 

A lot of you are confused to the agent ban thing! In its current state pick and ban would be useless but imagine something like 5 breaches (obv similar abilities and not 5 breaches literally) ulting on ascend B site! .... at some point, it just gets mandatory to balance the game! Look at rb6, which in many ways is very similar to valorant!

After looking at her career, she only had two games in the past 8 matches of ranked where she had more than 10 kills and constantly bottomed fragged. On top of that she mentioned she was some type of streamer/content creator and we shouldn't curse or tilt which is so ironic. While I think smurfing and cheating is a problem I do believe that there should be away to address those player who use their account as a free ticket to a higher rank. I think if you played more than three matches with someone who was caught cheating you should have to re-promote into the division you are currently in. The matches are bo5 and losing will result in you losing a whole rank.

VALORANT,2021,1,"Greetings to the community! I started playing valorant just recently and i thought that it would be easy for me to reach at least diamond considering i play cs since 2002 and being currently a rank 10 faceit player and also i was semi pro in 2004-2007. 

Guess not!! it seems that i cant hit any shots getting deleted by literally everyone on DM even tho i ""feel"" the aim. Does anyone faces the same situation? Is there a cummulative guide maybe on different things considering aim? Or should i stick to cs because im crap at this?

Also i have literally zero interest in going pro or something like that.

VALORANT,2021,1,"This is obviously a subjective opinion, but personally I find Ice Box a solid map overall. Comparing it to Split and Bind especially. I prefer Ice Box over these two maps for a few reasons. It just feels fresh and balanced on both sides. On Split, it’s extremely defense heavy and on Bind the teleporter forces inconsistent rotations on both sides. That said, I love this game so much even the maps that aren’t my favorite are still fun to play. I just feel like Ice Box gets a bad rep for no apparent reason.

WHAT ID CHANGE to make the gun better:
Remove scope animation( but add the blur or inaccuracy upon entering scope like in cs )
reduce movement speed with op but make crouch walking with it 100% accuracy
with these changes we may be able to see different oping playstyles compared to holding angles all game",2021-01-03 21:13:38

How do I turn on the neon for sovas recon arrow? It’s definitely possible on my laptop (I tried using another acc and the recon is neon) but for my laptop the settings make it so that the waves from the recon are really hard to see.  
I believe the brighter/ neon effect is there for certain other characters as well.

Then they’ll just scream slurs and insults at you. 

Please do something about this. Again, it’s probably already been said, but I don’t see any harm repeating it. People don’t get chat banned for no reason. A little trash talk is fine IMO but chat bans happen if people are overly toxic. It’s pathetic. These same toxic people are then allowed to join games and ruin the experience for others.

VALORANT,2021,1,"this issue has been in the game since beta. ive since improved my internet situation so its no longer relevant, but i dont recall this ever being brought up and i know its still happening in game.

from the whole spectrum of dc'ing so briefly you literally dont even notice it happened, maybe looking like a spike in packet loss. all the way to the exiting game/getting flashed like animation playing, only for you to rejoin the game in a couple seconds after fade to black. 

ive had my voice chat completely disabled for both of those instances and everything in between.

the most annoying part is that you can easily not ever notice. the only times to realize it are in agent select (if everyone has an X next to their mic, dont assume theyre all chat banned) or being in game and transmitting (still appears locally like you are, but no one can hear you) and it seeming like no other call outs are occurring and no one is responding to you",2021-01-03 23:38:59

VALORANT,2021,1,"The idea behind tagging is that an enemy can't just run through a spray..  

The reality is that a bullet hits them and instead of making them stop, it lets them slide another couple feet and then stop dead, essentially giving them a free counterstrafe before you get the chance to reset your recoil.

Such a bizarre implementation of the mechanic, rewarding people for getting shot in the body.

Given how it takes an extra 33% body shots to kill in valorant compared to CS, really feels like they should look into a more unique approach, rather than just giving everyone who gets tagged a free opportunity to headshot the poor bastard who has to wait 20 minutes for his recoil to reset.

VALORANT,2021,1,"So I’ve been playing valorant since the beta, and have really enjoyed it. And have also been playing CS since last year. I’m only rank silver in valorant but gold in CS (but I think I got carried to that rank). But I don’t think any of that matters.

The reason why I ask, is that all of my friends who have thousands of hours of not then hundreds on CSGO, and whenever I bring up valorant they say ‘who plays that’ and when I ask why the hate, they say it’s just a dumbed down version of csgo.

I disagree, I find it much more fun because csgo just isn’t to me. All of my csgo games are stressful, and it’s so unforgiving that unless I keep playing for hundreds more hours I won’t ever find it fun.

Valorant on the other hand, I find a lot more fun. The abilities give me so much more freedom, I don’t have to rely on learning smoke lineups. My friends say that having a literal ability that created a smoke cloud where you click is lazy and unskillful, but in cs they literally spend hours watching videos to learn smokes, like reading from a textbook, and aside from on the fly grenade tosses don’t seem that creative.

One thing I can agree on their part is the movement is a lot less floaty in valorant, which even if it means counter strafing is less necessary, I don’t see that as a bad thing.

So now the game has been out for a while, do you see it as a lesser CSGO? Better? Or would you just say it’s different and leave it at that?

No matter what I’ll keep playing it, I only play cs when my friends are but none of them play valorant, but I’m fine with that.",2021-01-04 00:27:07

VALORANT,2021,1,"Im in Bronze 3 about a month a go and it was mostly 1 win and then 1 lose

Didn't get particular upset about this but i am now somehow in Bronze 1(or was)  
Today i got icebox in a full bronze lobby and we won in overtime 14-12 and i was 2nd frag playing jett(My main is omen)  
Decide to play one more and then its Haven in an IRON lobby and i deduced this because i was the only bronze. Then 3 out of 5 people instalock as dualist and then the other guy pickes the last dualist. Since omen was avalablie i picked him.   


Round 3  
Reyna leaves(Iron 1) it was a pretty close game to as it was 1-2 so im not sure why they left and since its a 5v5 player and game and we cant even remake the game cause its round 3, its basically over  
The top frag phenix tries to surrender and it fails.  


After switching sides we atttempt a surrecnder vote and the game is over.   
Bronze 1 ----&gt; Iron 3  


This dosnt make since becuase   
\#1 we were down a player and losing shoudn't affect either teams that much  
\#2 i know that losing a game affects the rank more the winning but i had already won 2 games(Inclusing the icebox game)  


What i would like to see  
a. a better ranking system concering people dissconecting  
b. a better win loss system where they are based on what agent was selected and how well they played it(You cant expect a cypher who has untility to Stall or gain information while holding a site to top frag though it happened sometimes.",2021-01-04 00:58:20

VALORANT,2021,1,"Hi everyone! We hope you all have had a memorable New Year and Happy Holidays. We just closed submissions for our [recent moderator applications post](https://www.reddit.com/r/VALORANT/comments/kdwp47/winter_2020_valorant_mod_apps/) and we will begin choosing candidates within the next couple of weeks. In the meantime, we are starting off the New Year with a couple of rule changes/additions that pertain to directly linked videos and LFG(looking for group) threads.

---

#####Clips/Videos

Our clips rule will be changed to:

&gt;Videos that are focused on gameplay are not allowed to be directly linked unless they are related to an eSports event, are informational content, or are accompanied by a text post with over 1,000 characters. Esports events are defined as any event listed in the [Liquipedia list of VALORANT tournaments](https://liquipedia.net/valorant/Portal:Tournaments), provided that it is classified as an S, A, B, or C-Tier Tournament. These clips must be over 15s in length.

&gt; Examples of submissions that are **not allowed** to be directly linked: 

&gt; - Look at my Ace!
&gt; - My funny clip from competitive!
&gt; - My big clutch 1v6
&gt; - Check out my montage

&gt; Examples of submissions that are **allowed** to be directly linked: 

&gt; - 100T steel clutches out round vs C9
&gt; - Analyzing the playstyle of TL ScreaM
&gt; - What is different in high levels, or ranks of play?
&gt; - Fanmade Valorant Animation
&gt; - Explaining Valorant Lore 

[Our previous clip rule](https://www.reddit.com/r/VALORANT/comments/jcirnx/state_of_the_subreddit_clips_reposts_and_survey/) did not accurately represent our initial intent regarding clips, which was to limit the number of standard gameplay clips such as aces and montages. The wording for the previous rule was too strict since it applied to **all** directly linked videos that were not related to esports or informational content. This change will allow for more variety when it comes to directly linked videos where the focus is not the gameplay itself while also continuing the disallowance of standard ace/montage type videos to be directly linked. Please note that there is still a minimum time requirement for directly linked videos and that they have to be at least 15 seconds long.


---

#####LFGs

The following will be formally added to the rule list:

&gt; Users may not submit looking for group posts. Please use the subreddit [discord server](https://discord.gg/P8EyvjA) or find an existing community using the search feature.

&gt;- Posting team recruitments, tournaments, and communities are **allowed**

&gt;- Individuals searching for other individuals or a small group to play with is **disallowed**

We have never allowed users to post LFG threads and this has been the only non-listed rule that we have enforced. Reddit is traditionally not a great platform for finding people to play with. Unless you use a dedicated subreddit where people are constantly looking in new, it is very rare that someone looking for people to play with will see a new post in time. Real-time communication platforms like Discord are much better suited for finding people to play with. Please also utilize the [search feature](https://www.reddit.com/r/VALORANT/search) to explore other communities!",2021-01-04 01:14:03

and because i am an artist, it is time for me to point out every mistake i have made since all artists ever do is hate their art and never finish a wip (this drawing? was supposed to have more but i said nah)

so you see, i thought to myself, ""i'm going to add some more \~𝑓𝑙𝑎𝑣𝑜𝑟\~ to this sour milk of a woman and make her a bit of a snerson"" (a snake person, she is one singular individual unit (also is she single? rioters please message me back with an answer) and sneeple is plural)

as an enthusiast of herpetology, i am absolutely ashamed of what i have done. i KNOW snake scales do not look like that, yet i did it ANYWAY because i am LAZY. i am DEVASTATED looking back at my actions, but i also could not care less right now because i have lost the ability to use my dominant hand right now after deciding i could not take any more of this torture and rushed to finish this piece without taking any breaks to avoid the possibility of my entire arm seizing up (can't play valorant now but it's honestly for the best since i'd be losing games too)

before anyone asks, i do not know how many hours went into this and i don't want to because i don't need to know how much time i wasted on this only to give up and completely fuck up what was an amazing start (i'm not surprised since i always do that, but i am still disappointed as usual). i also did not erase the lines from the bare minimum i had of a sketch because i am once more, LAZY and STUPID

FPS Games (Mostly CS 4k H rest \~4k as well) CS - GE 10th lvl faceit

LoL 3k H

Fortnite 720 H

HS/RTS/Logic games - 1.5k H  


Valorant - Played a lot in beta, playing rn

&amp;#x200B;

So, from my PoV I will try to explain how I feel about the game.

Maps:

Split - Not my cup of tea, main problem is that it require a lot of teamplay and with soloq it's hard to achieve that, hated it in beta got used to it rn, overall very playable map. Only changes I would make is actually B site due to Cypher and KJ are able to protect it alone.

Heaven - Balance is decent, could be better but I like the map overall.

Bind - My fav map, have no problems with its balance, tp mechanic is unique.

Ascent - A lot of ppls don't like this map but still it's playable, have no problem with playing that as well

Icebox - I see a lot of hate in High Elo about this but actually I like it. The B site need to be changed because it have too many ways and it's just hard to play at. Probably after playing that map dozens of times you are able to get this.

Overall, maps are not a problem for CS players, not even talking about OW ones.

Shooting:

Something that IMO has good overall concept but needs to be changed in some way. What is better than CS is 1st shot accuracy (meaning if you are doing everything right you will get that headshot which in CS with deag is not possible every time) but ffs who designed running hs. Sometimes when headshotting enemy I'm getting so dissatisfied because I know I shouldn't do it.

Frenzy in pistol rounds is so benefiting while requiring no skill same to spectre.

Right click classic is powerful but it should still be in the game - low skill requirement and we just have to get used to it cuz its actually good mechanic (at least IMO)

Eco/force is too easy to win due to headshotting enemy which makes his crosshair go to other side of the map which shouldn't be a thing having 1k kevlar - that's my opinion but the current state is good enough to play with.

Shooting bad should be punished and in Valorant is actually not doing it well enough.

Overall, running and shooting overall should be more punishable but the game is not designed like cs go and is trying to be more arcade so all we can do rn is just get used to it.

Matchmaking system:

I'm a big fan of fast ranking, Idk how it is in ranks below plat but if you are performing and winning you are getting fast rank ups it's getting harder only in Immortal 2-Radiant.

Disable the ability to start a game as 4 ppls because probably they won't communicate with a solo player which will make him nearly impossible to play the game with his full performance.

The problem is a lot of players I'm was getting matched with weren't having microphones (in high plat / diamond) which was making the game harder because u need fast information without looking at chat or any other side of the screen. 

Having no problem with cheaters below high Immortal.

Overall, it's fine only problems are 4ppls premades while playing alone, high elo cheaters.

If the feedback will be good will cover every one. I would like to hear your points and tell me which mistakes I made and let me correct them.",2021-01-04 02:32:54

VALORANT,2021,1,"Hello,

I am a plat 2-Diamond 1 player in Valorant and I am well aware that smurfing has been an issue in every game for ever and there isn't really a way to solve the issue because there's no real way of knowing whether somebody is a Smurf or not.

However, Valorant is one of the games that I've played that seems to have the MOST amount Smurfs in competitive. You can't really put a % on how often you'll encounter one, but browsing through reddit I can clearly see that many people are seeing them in 3/5 games, 2/3, etc. so these aren't really small numbers. The reason I'm saying these upper ranked players are ruining Valorant is because they are ruining the experience for lower ranked players that want to climb and improve, because of how often they cannot realistically control the outcome of their games when they have an immortal on either the enemy team or their own. 

I understand why people want to Smurf, either they want to play with their friends that are lower ranks, they want to make themselves feel good, long queue times at higher ranks or whatever reason it may be. However, the fact of the matter is there won't be anymore lower ranked players that want to play the game if they're running into these higher ranked players every other game or so. I think the core problem is the fact that Valorant doesn't have a very big community yet seeing as it's still a new game which makes higher ranks need to go lower to find games and the fact that you can only play with friends 1 divison away from your rank unlike in CSGO. 

Anyways, I'm complaining without having an actual solution to the issue that RIOT could implement but it does make me a little sad seeing a game I've been enjoying so much have an influx of Smurfs.

VALORANT,2021,1,"Most people in low ranks don’t realize that deathmatch is a great way to improve aim, learn new spray patterns and train overwall. By giving more xp per game, or alternatively, giving xp based on your score/kills, it would motivate people to play more DM and consequently, improving. This would also be good for those who want to finish an agent contract and battle pass. For example, right now I am at the end of the bp and even though I don’t really want to play a full length game, I kinda am required to, so instead of playing DM and improving myself, I have to play when I am not in my best day.

If the ball doesn't hit anything for 3 seconds, it disappears, rendering the ability useless. (Get 1 free each round, can buy 2 more for 200 creds each).

***Purchasable ability 1: Solid smokes.*** Summons up to 3 solid balls and a cue. FIRE to hit each ball with the cue. Ball/s travel/s for 2-5 seconds (depending on the strength of the hit) in the direction hit before transforming into a smoke. Smokes last for 7 seconds each. (Can buy 3 for 100 creds each)

***Purchasable ability 2: Cue ball Deniers.*** Summons a white cue ball and a cue. FIRE to hit the cue ball with the cue. The cue ball continues to exist until it reaches the ground and creates a hole that instantly kills anyone who tries to step on it, including allies and self. Lasts for 7 seconds once the hole is created. (can buy 1 for 500 creds)

They also would spawn in front of the spike (on icebox) and run into mid making the round almost unwinnable. I have seen other posts complaining about things similar to this and I believe a /kick could solve a lot of problems.

Things like throwers, AFKs, toxic players, or even smurfs could be impacted if a team could kick a player.

This would of course need balancing to stop the team from kicking the bottom player just to get the extra econ. or it could not work at all if the player being kicked if they are in a duo queue. I think a system where a team will only get the full econ boost if the player being kicked either doesn't vote in the decision (so allow all five players to vote and if it ends with 4-0) or as a combat score of less then a specified amount. If the said player does vote (a 4-1 vote) then the team could get a reduced or no compensation. This of course is up to the discrepancy of the devs but it is just an idea.

Also, an auto-mute for the said player would be needed for toxicity reasons. What do you think of this idea?",2021-01-04 05:09:16

VALORANT,2021,1,"Let me start off by saying I know better hardware =/= better player. I know upgrading won’t instantly make me hit immortal, and I know 60hz players on higher ranks exist.

I peaked Diamond 1 a few weeks ago, but I’ve been stuck plat 2-3 for a while now. I think it’s also important for me to point out this is my first ever FPS and I’ve built most of my game sense and crosshair placement from watching pros. Anyway, I have a LOT of trouble winning fights, even when it seems like I have the advantage. Whether I’m holding an angle or peeking, by the time I see my opponent they already shot at me, and most of the times killed me. I’m not confident at all at taking fights in any scenario, even after warming up with DMs before my actual matches.

Another thing I’ve noticed is pistol rounds are impossible for me as I can’t for the life of me track a moving enemy, even after using aim trainers for that specifically and changing my sensitivity it seems to make no difference. 

Because of this I exclusively play support characters and heavily rely on getting good duelist teammates (I solo queue) so I can help them pop off, but if I get unlucky I have no chance. I’ve managed to stay plat playing this way but I don’t think I’ll ever go past that if I keep having this much trouble fighting. 

More information on my setup: My monitor is relatively old (6 years old, specifically) and is not meant for gaming. It’s a 27’’ 60hz 7ms monitor, no freesync/gsync, the image quality is good. However, i get extremely bad screen tearing. Every slight move I make causes tearing. My pc runs consistent 180-200fps, I cap them at 120 to reduce the tearing a bit, capping at 60hz makes the game feel really choppy and laggy, and turning on vsync creates huge input delay which I can’t play with at all. 
I know there’s good 60hz players out there, but I feel like there’s a difference between a “gaming” focused 60hz monitor and a regular one.

So, is it fair for me to partly blame my monitor for being so bad at gunfights, or is it most likely that my aim and and decision making are flawed? Perhaps a combination of both?

Am I the only one who is looking forward to Riot to adjust the moving accuracy, because every second death in ranked games is a full speed-headshot from a guy running with a gun that should be accurate only when standing still?

If a player misses the featured bundle period (due to insufficient credits or bad timing or otherwise), and buys every gun skin from that bundle individually from the store after the featured period, the knife skin that comes along with the bundle should show up as free.

This would benefit players as it would decrease the pressure of deciding to buy the full bundle all at once, and would benefit Riot as it would encourage players to buy skins for guns that they otherwise would not buy, generating more revenue. 

Additionally, this would not take away from the appeal of buying the full bundle during the featured time period as there will still be the incentives of gun buddies and player cards. I feel like this feature would be a win-win for both Riot and the player base.

VALORANT,2021,1,"The agent isn't out yet, but already looking at his kit bewilders me.

**Why does he have a Flash instead of Nearsight?**

His theme seems to be a stealthy trickster, **his name means 'Night' in Japanese**. Maybe a ninja? He's a master of sound manipulation. Fakes. Tricks. Paranoia.

It feels like the ball was dropped a little giving him a Flash instead of Nearsight. He could've easily had a bouncing **Nearsight grenade** as opposed to a Flash. Namely because of 3 main reasons:

\- **Flash deviates from his theme (Night? Ninja? Sound?) as opposed to Nearsight.**

\- The lineup becomes skewed. There are 3 flashers (Phoenix, Breach, Skye) and 2 Nearsighters (Reyna and Omen). **Giving him Flash makes him the fourth flasher, which spoils things in terms of debuff availability.**

\- Being a fellow Duelist, he dips into Phoenix's pot of players. He might not have as fast a flash, but the fact is that their **Venn diagram in the Duelist role overlaps a bit too strongly.**

&amp;#x200B;

The third point, in particular, Phoenix is supposed to be the **Duelist of sight manipulation**. Firewalls to block off sight, quick flashes to blind enemies.

Yoru seemed geared up to be the **sound manipulation Duelist** and it would have worked pretty well with Nearsight to instill panic and fake Footsteps to throw them off immediately after, but with his Flash, I feel like it's an opportunity wasted.

&amp;#x200B;

**Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying Yoru is UNPLAYABLE.** He's going to be eaten up on release like every other new Agent, and he's gonna be made workable in some way with enough plays. I just felt that... man, there were some things that really could have been capitalized on with him and they weren't.

**Even if Flash is arguably more useful than Nearsight**, if an Agent has Nearsight, player strategies will evolve to utilize Nearsight eventually. **It just feels like such a missed opportunity here**, like a little spice that would have made him a bit more special and unique. I wonder if the devs came across this train of thought before (speaking as a fellow game dev) or was the decision to use Flash extracted from its frequency of use in eSports?

What do you guys think?",2021-01-04 09:57:33
VALORANT,2021,1,"I think the Radianite Hazard card could be an Easter egg/lore related item.

A lot of the voice lines regarding enemies in Valorant usually have something to do with someone calling another person a copy or stating that they're better than their twin. I'm starting to think Radianite has something to do with interdimensional travel in addition to causing superhuman abilities.

Why?

Well if you look near the top of the Radianite Hazard card, there is a mesh diagram of what I think is a wormhole.

With the addition of Skye's voice lines, particularly the ""they're like us but different"" line, I've been moving towards that theory even more.

And if Radianite really is related to interdimensional travel in addition to it's other traits, perhaps that would explain Omen's abilities as well.

We know that Omen doesn't have much back story, and he goes on and on about keeping himself together. 

But I've also noticed that when the Spike detonates, it's basically a black hole. 
My current theory for Omen is that maybe he was a scientist or maybe just some innocent person working for Kingdom or what have you, when he got caught up in an accidental Spike explosion.

Now, normally someone would die when caught in the range of the explosion. Now, if I am right about Radianite having something to do with the ability to travel between dimensions AND also give superhuman abilities, then maybe it's possible  that Omen was next to some Radianite crates when caught in a Spike explosion. 

So instead of dying, he was instead ripped apart multiple times and stretched throughout space-time. ""Yea, but it says that he strikes from the shadows! And he had a voice lines that says 'shadows travelling'. What does that have to do with space time?""

Well, that's the funny thing. If we consider the fact that Omen has very little idea of his origins, then maybe he resorted to calling his orbs Shadow Orbs for the sake of simplicity.

TLDR;. I have a theory that the Radianite Hazard card could be an Easter egg giving insight into what Radianite can do, and maybe Omen has his powers because of a freak accident with the Spike and Radianite.

Hey guys! This is SquishiRex back with another video of My Life in Iron in Valorant. If you don't know about me, I make videos where i comment about how my game awareness is that of an iron player but somehow I was placed in gold. There are tons of jokes in it about my lack of skills and almost always my teammates lack of skills because who am I kidding, its always my teammates' fault.  Its been five months since i made my last video(life gets in the way and not the iron type) but I'm back and ready to make people laugh in life again. I think its good sometimes to sit back and laugh at how bad you are at this game. If that is too difficult for you to do, then you can sit back and laugh at how bad myself and my duo partner is at Valorant. I definitely plan to make more of these videos because they are fun to make and to think up witty things to say. I never have a lack of clips because lets face it, many of my games go the same.

VALORANT,2021,1,"As many other users posts suggest, the rise of cheaters in Valorant is worrying. Even with Vanguard auto-executing at computer start, it's not being able to stop waves of cheaters that we all have been suffering for the last month. Knowing that one of the cool points of Valorant against CS is the anticheat protection (as CS is absolutely filled with cheaters), this poses a huge risk for the game's community development. Valorant will be 100% dead competitively if this issue keeps unchanged much more time.

Last, but not least: we also urgently need a new map on this new Act (and season). With the current map pool, there are too many map repetitions, aswell there's not enough maps to filter some out with a map selector or so. I know that each Act gets an agent OR a map released, but... I really feel this game cannot afford to wait another \~3 months for the next map, don't you?

Valorant is an amazing game, and I think it's steadily (but slowly) growing in numbers. But many people are leaving the game because of the core problems that the game currently presents, being two of them, these two that I list here (and I consider the most problematic ones).

I understand that Reyna is a great character to play for frags. Or how its cool to self heal as Phoenix. Same thing with Sage. 

However, there is more to those characters than simply taking care of yourself. 

In low elo lobbies, I see far too many people baiting as Reyna or Phoenix. 

If you actually read their description, and play them the way they are meant to be played, they are the first in the fight. They use their utility to open up the site, and allow team mates to follow up on them. 

Playing Sage is neat, because you can heal yourself. But if you heal yourself at 80 hp, and you have a teammate at 20 hp, the collective team hp is lower because of you deciding to heal yourself, thus putting your team in a worse spot.

VALORANT,2021,1,"Hi there! I've been enjoying Valorant since its beta, and the reason I've been periodically leaving/coming back to the game, is the fact that the game never felt like having enough maps.

This is because when there's such a small map pool, you usually get too many map repetitions on a decent daily play routine. Playing a map once or twice a day is not bad, but when you get into the third repetition, it starts being annoying. You can expect that when you have a day of full playing, but not on more modest sessions.

Sure, we can blame the Valorant's map selection algorithm, but as for now, it seems to be random (or as much, slightly biased towards Icebox because of it being new, maybe?). That's not a problem if you have a decent amount of maps from where to choose: it becomes increasingly difficult, statistically speaking, to have so many map repetitions, if the game has more maps to choose from.

And, you know, everybody likes new content. On tactical shooters, especially maps.

For example, the week Valorant was released to the public (I was in beta) some kid instalokced Reyna and said they were a Reyna main. They then proceeded to not know what either soul orb did along with their ult and leer.

VALORANT,2021,1,"The spawn systen is flawed, most maps are too open and the ping system makes it worse. On top of that mid and low rank players suffer from matchups against immortals every game.   


So i don't just complain i also came up with ideas to improve the things i mentioned.  


To make the spawn system better it could help to introduce a system that denies a spawn if another player is in a certain radius or (close to) line of sight. This change might increase the spawn time a few seconds now and then but would lead to MUCH fewer spawnkills.  


For the map problem i only came up whith the idea of a map specifically designed for deathmatch but i think this problem is the smallest one.  


The Pings should be removed completely in my opinion but another option would be to mark the new spawned player for everyone on their maps so not only the spawned player gets the advantage.  


The last thing to add would be some sort of SBMM, similar to the one used in unranked. Players would now be able to better warm up for their games instead of either getting just one-shotted by higher elo players or the other way round by having to play against lower players who are no challange to play against.   


I hope this reaches out because i would really like to see this mode improve as it is one of my favourite modes in other games.",2021-01-04 13:23:19

I understand there is a difference with asking or suggesting agents to buff the team's potential (eg suggesting Omen or Brim for smokes) and this is acceptable. HOWEVER you shouldn't be begging people to play as a healer purely because you want to be pocket healed all the time.

If you want an agent in the lineup, you should play that agent. If you don't want to play that agent and beg others to play them instead, don't complain if they don't get chosen

VALORANT,2021,1,"Basically whenever the round started they would pick up spike and stay in spawn. It wasn’t like they just picked up spike and went into a corner they pushed a little bit, for clarification. However, they basically made it a 4v5. They just sat in an angle where they could see the part where you attack B on Ascent before the gates drop every round. When the entire team confronted them they just said if we got kills they would push up...but the logic makes no sense. Valorant should be a team game where everyone uses their abilities to push or defend. This was in unrated too so we didn’t really get kills(this was one of my first few matches). When we didn’t get any kills they just blamed us even though they could’ve been refragging. Has this happened to anyone else?",2021-01-04 15:27:07

Apologies if this has been posted 10000 times here - but I'm looking for some guidance as a player who's looking to get into Valorant.

I have played CS:GO for many years, I have racked up about 2-3k hours and reached Global Elite multiple times, however I fancy a change now. I've watched some Valorant and it looks super cool, really interesting and I'm seriously tempted. But...

It all looks so confusing in comparison to CS! How will I know which agent to pick? Having to learn all of their abilities etc. What's the movement like, can you bhop and move swiftly around the map to gain an edge (or just look cool!), are there skins? How does the ranking system work?

So. Many. Questions. - Are there any decent resources for me to read/watch as I dip my toes in as a beginner?

A time based agent.

Ultimate= Agent slows down time in the game so the timer reduces quicker

 Recharge Ability: Agent creates a barrier or smoke that makes allies faster (running) and enemies (slower)

Ability: Agent creates a trap that can be placed on the floor which makes them slower and their gunfire slower.

VALORANT,2021,1,"With the upcoming ranked changes (and leaks indicating that there will be a numerical xp value for ranking up) I would like to suggest an Elo safety net between ranked groups (i.e. Silver 3 ranked up to Gold 1)  


**Why should such a thing exist?**  


From my experience as a Bronze 3 (Peak Silver 1) player, when I ranked up to Silver 1, my first game as a silver player was ruined by an AFK on my team, and a smurf reyna who admitted that she was Diamond 2 who went 45 -3. We lost that game 2 -13. As per usual, I demoted back to bronze 3. That really ruined my motivation to play. I feel that an elo safety net would help players adjust to the next ranked group up. This would stop players getting frustrated in situations like mine.  


**How would this system work?**

Since the leak indicates a base 100 system (between ranks) the safety net would work like this:  


Iron to Bronze: 50 ELO safety net  
Bronze to Silver: 42 ELO safety net  
Silver to Gold: 34 ELO safety net  
Gold to Platinum: 26 ELO safety net  
Platinum to Diamond: 15 ELO safety net  
Diamond to Immortal: 5 ELO safety net  
Immortal to Radiant: No ELO safety net  


Some of the nets are not multiples of 5 because not all game loss points are not multiples of 5.  


Example:   
Let's say Player X ranks up from Gold to Plat, going from 87 points in Gold 3 to 6 points in Plat 1.    
In X's next game, he loses 5 - 13, losing X 22 points. Because of the low amount of points he has in Platinum, he has to use the ELO safety net, which means instead of going from 6 points to 84 points he goes from 6 to 10/26 safety net ELO. Now, he wins the next game 13 - 9. From this, he gets 16 ranked points. He is now at 26/26 safety net ELO or 0 points in Platinum. As he continues to win, he keeps gaining ELO.  


**NOTES:**

This system is based on the ranked safety system in Call of Duty Mobile.  
The points gained and lost are not depictive of the actual point amounts gained and lost.|  
The amount of ELO safety net can be changed to make the game more fair if needed.  


Please, feel free to ask questions and or Clarifications. This is just an idea I had and I wanted to know what the community here thinks.",2021-01-04 16:25:20

VALORANT,2021,1,"As someone playing from central part of Canada I feel like it would be a good idea if Valorant could add servers located in central parts of Canada as there are quite a few people playing from central parts of the country and currently the only decent option would be playing on the Illinois server and maybe get 55 ping which puts you as a player at a huge disadvantage against someone who has 20 ping

Here is a scenario.. lets say you and your friend are playing against each other on icebox, you are located in central part of Canada so for example Edmonton, AB (55 ping) and your friend is in Chicago, IL (15-20 ping) you both peek mid at the same time and because of the ping difference your friend gets to see your agent model sooner (faster) than you see his and thus you die first. In the other scenario, having high ping would make it less fun for someone who has lower ping too as the person with 55-60ping could shoulder peek and take a shoot for example, as the server registers the bullet being fired and hits the target where it supposed to a person with 20 ping is now dead because of they didn't get a chance to really even see you and yet they are now dead.

Ping in FPS based games takes a lot of fun away from playing the game and now because of ping difference as a player you got to adjust to shooting with possible ping lag which may not be accurate shooting that would be there with lower ping like 10-15 for example. I think for some people who are new to valorant and new to FPS shooters in general they could benefit a ton from learning to shoot accurately without any ping interference and you would have far more fun and would enjoy the game a lot more if your ping is around 15-20 compared to 60-70.

Do you guys feel it would be a good idea to add a central based server located in Canada?

however, my friend who plays overwatch and has more fps experience than me states that i should just wait it out and that i die too easily bc i walk in the line of fire. 

even though she is lowkey right bc i forget to peek on some maps, my constant rebuttal has always been “i’m a duelist so i think it’s okay if i die. i’m just here to get kills and report, not to plant or heal” but my friend keeps telling me to stay back and aid her with planting instead.

i’m rlly confused now since my team and reddit tells me to go in first like i usually would, but now i’m being told to stay back? i’m no expert at val, but i think if my friend (who plays as a viper main) should go with someone else that’s not me?

VALORANT,2021,1,"so I've been hardstuck iron for 2 months now and I'd say I have a pretty decent understanding of how the game works. Firstly, what I see a lot is that while defending, my team will immediately rush in at the start of the round to get frags, then run straight into the entire enemy team and shredded. Please, hold your ground, defenders have access to more ground at the start of the match, allowing them to get better positions against the attackers, by running in right away you lose that advantage and will almost always die. Another thing is with flashes, this happens to me a lot and I'm sure a lot of you have had it happen before, PLEASE make a callout when you're about to flash, give your teammates a second or two to step back and get ready for it. Now about crosshair placement, mine isn't the best so I can't really say anything about it but for the love of god, don't look at the ground while walking around, try to place your crosshair around chest level at least so you don't lose every fight. The last thing I would like to talk about is instalocking, more specifically, instalocking duelists. I know it's exciting to play raze and get that sweet 4k with her ult, but duelists work best when supported by other classes, if we already have 2 duelists and you're about to lock into a third, please consider selecting an initiator or controller.

VALORANT,2021,1,"First, let me preface with the important: I don’t consider myself good at all at this game. 
I started when the beta came out, was gold, took a few months off because I got bored/was addicted to Tarkov at the time. 

Anyways, first question I have is 1.) does everyone who’s unranked get slotted into bronze  by default? That’s been the case on my main and I made a smurf to compare and it was the same(maybe I’m just trash at the game but I’m just confirming).

2.) does it really not matter at all how good you do individually? For example(again, not tooting much own horn because I admit I’m bad at the game; this is a product of endless smurfs) I’ll regularly get 4k’s, sometimes an ace, and am usually the team/match mvp, but I’ll get de ranked lol. I ask this, because although I am terrible, I have friends who are very popular and have either their group of simps/admirers(not being sexist, I mean this both ways) carry them to very high tiers in valorant, although they usually go negative every game. I’m not a jealous person, but I also see it for what it is lol.

I ask these questions, although I’m sure they’ve been asked a million times here, and follow it with a third question. 3.) how do you escape bronze elo hell if that is the case. I ask this, because this is a free game and I’d say 98% of the solo queue lobbies I’ve joined are just packed with smurfs and trollers. Kids are bored right now, totally get it. Still annoying. 

I did do a quick search, and the top response or top post addressing it is “well bro, you just gotta do better. Once you do better you rise up”. Nah, none of my friends play to carry me constantly to victory/to have a full team for one single competitive game. So for other solo queue dudes out there who see it for what it is, what have you done to break this curse? Looking for realistic advice other than “get good”. Thanks.",2021-01-04 18:34:26

I have been talking with RIOT support which they asked me to do bunch of tests, give them logs etc. After they established that my connection is near perfect, they asked me to talk to ISP to see if they can do anything with the routing. I did that, ISP was kind enough to reconfigure routing to Germany and I still have the same issues, and then last thing I was told by RIOT support was to either upgrade to fibre (which isn't possible for me) or change ISP (which isnt also possible). I'm used to having 30-35ms on CSGO, Fortnite, PUBG, and any other game when I connect to German servers. Why are VALORANT servers so bad for me. What can I even do to fix this issue.

&amp;#x200B;

Cue me sarting up Ranked, and I outperform my fellow Plat 3/Diamond 1 players. 

[After Match MVPing and winning 13-2 with a KDA of 22/9/1, I managed to get a Greatly Increased rating for Plat 3.](https://imgur.com/3bDTovR)

My next game was [a crushing loss](https://imgur.com/2bUHnNg). I knew that if I won this game I would be promoted to Diamond 1, however, despite my best efforts, I could not. My team would also not settle for a draw either.  I ended up [gold-starring every player on the enemy team except one](https://imgur.com/e97TW04).  

&amp;#x200B;

Disheartened at the loss, I queued up for a decider game; win this, and I'd keep playing. lose, and I'd be done for the day.

VALORANT,2021,1,"Hello!

I'd like to add a quick disclaimer that I'm relatively new to Valorant. I got it in the beta, but just picked it up again. So, sorry if this question has been asked a million times before but I'd like some advice from people who are less bad than me. Thanks!

First off, I have gotten by far the most comfortable with Jett. I can play a little with viper too, but I like playing aggressive and catching opponents off guard. I actually think my mechanics and game sense are pretty solid, but I'm getting held back due to inconsistencies such as switching between the vandal and the phantom. I'm a bronze 3 right now, and believe I'm pretty close to getting silver.

I like using the vandal, and frankly, I really want to like it. When I use the vandal I find myself going for headshots more. Another big part of it is that I really like the elderflame and prime skins (I know, I know. Shouldn't be such a big factor in my decision.) I switched over to the vandal when it got buffed and everyone was talking about it. Also, I sometimes struggle to get long range kills with the phantom.

I was using the phantom for a long time though. It appealed to me initially because I like to get up close and in everyone's faces. I'd say I'm also able to get kills with the phantoms, but I find myself going more for body shots. This is likely because I'm able to get away with body shots in bronze/silver territory. Many advise using the phantom to spray through smokes. This makes perfect sense but I rarely try that.

So, with that in mind, what do you guys recommend? I'm unsure because looking on twitch/youtube I see some play Jett with the phantom and some with the vandal. I know it's personal preference, and that maybe one is better than the other in certain situations. As I said, I'd like to get the consistency down and find one that I can stick to though.

Thanks for any help, all advice goes a long way. Sorry to anyone who read through this essay of a post. Have a good one!",2021-01-04 20:26:21

Reasons why to do it:  


1. literally just help you with mental. If you're doing bad, you will be deterred by your score and just do bad. If you're doing good, you will become egotistical and go for ego peeks and just die.
2. The scoreboard lowers your fps, if you have a bad pc like I do, lowering you fps will screw your reaction time up. So if someone just peeks you while looking at your scoreboard, you'll most likely not be focused and not able to react fast enough.

VALORANT,2021,1,"Title. I'm Silver 3 and just got absolutely stomped by a Jett (which I'm pretty certain was a smurf, I've never once seen anyone play like that in this elo). 

I was playing as Killjoy on Ascent B site and I could not counter her in anyway. She would just dash into site and one shot me with a shotgun, or dash into site after updrafting and one shot me with the blades, I just could not do anything, my aim is not great, but it's at least serviceable in this ELO, but that Jett gave me barely a split second to react. I usually play in the doorway to CT, and I had to go into site after her and well, die, just in case she had the spike on her.

I know, if she's doing that, I should be expecting it and punishing her, but I couldn't, I don't know how, and I almost quit because of it, especially considering my abilities are well, useless against her since she just flies over everything not even triggering the alarmbot.

I'll admit I got very tilted and said some less-than-honorable things on chat, which I'm not proud of, as I strive to be a positive player and rage only to myself.

It's solo queue. First come, first serve. You have no idea how many times I've instalocked Reyna and have gotten trash talked from the very beginning of the game by a die hard Reyna main (even if I'm out fragging them).

Having the mentality that just because someone instalocked means they have to hard carry is fundamentally flawed. If they didn't instalock, you or someone else may have gotten that agent instead. It doesn't change the fact that the better player will outperform the other.",2021-01-04 22:35:57

VALORANT,2021,1,"Hey All,
After watching r/Doovid_Vu's [Giga Jett Boost](https://www.reddit.com/r/VALORANT/comments/jirvkg/giga_jett_boost_on_icebox/) on Icebox, I decided to investigate how/why this occurs. 


**I found this can be replicated.** But not only that, with some practice and correct timing, this can be achieved on any map in various spots.


[Replicating the Giga Boost using the dash ability](https://youtu.be/ghQVAoy1fc0)


**My ""Bounce"" mechanic:**

[Example 1](https://youtu.be/zqiKoMD2WBk)

[Example 2](https://youtu.be/xaDRFLUOVSA)

[Example 3](https://youtu.be/pPlrQOx3ySI)

[Example 4 - My favorite find](https://youtu.be/sr07tdXkUrc)


**Terminology:** 

Initial Angle (IA) - The angle that you need to look at the wall you are going to ride across before you hit the Bounce Object. (Close to 25 degrees off parallel with the wall)

Initial Distance (ID) - The distance from the bounce object that will give you the ideal lift if done properly. (3-5 character models)

Bounce Object (BO) - The small object that you will use to ""bounce"" off, generating the lift.


**Example 1 description:**
My BO is the small cylinder that I throw knives at before the jump. You then must stand against the wall and find the right IA. Once you are at the proper IA and ID from the BO, you press jump and dash simultaneously. With enough practice, you will get results similar or better than mine in the examples. FYI this took me some time to get a feel for the IA and ID. 


**What can I do this off of?**
This can be done off any small item, roughly knee height of the agents that has a hitbox that you can't simply walk over. It must stop you creating a corner.


**Is this practical?**
IMO, very. But I'm not giving up all my ""rollout"" spots just yet. If this post does well, I'll do more examples that I find useful, but for now I'm excited to see what you all will find.",2021-01-04 22:50:31
VALORANT,2021,1,"So I just want to confirm with everyone else this issue, because I'm pretty sure it is not just me, the Paris 1 and Frankfurt 1 servers have severely deteriorated recently, have they not?

VALORANT,2021,1,"Short post from a Silver Scrub, but one thing that's helped me improve a lot is playing expecting all the cheesy angles and hiding spots.

Pre aim is a very big step in improving if you don't do it already, but with it alone you will be reacting which still gives a considerable addition to reaction time.

Bigger Reaction Time = More room for error and enemy to kill you.

Expect your enemy to be where you aim. Set in your mind that they will wide swing this or shoulder peek it. It's helped me react faster to greedy peeks on Hookah and cheesy peeks on top of Icebox Tunnel. Just act as if you have info that someone is there, and make sure to do your Aim Labs/Kovaaks so that your muscles can react properly if someone actually is there.

VALORANT,2021,1,"Former Rioter here.
Left couple of years ago for health reasons and wanting to spend more time with family. Riot has been a blessing for me and very generous in many ways.
Saying this so you don't think I have any type of beef against the company. And because I love Riot I feel I have to say this: Valorant Sucks.

The game itself is great! Love the mechanic, the guns (except OPS), the champions, the skins...

But there are some things that make the game so unenjoyable that these positive things fade in the background.

1) Playing with friends. I play with a group of friends who are younger, more skilled and overall better at the game. We started playing normal and slowly moved to rank. All this together as a nice 5 pack. Every now and then we play alone so our rank slowly went apart. Me Iron and them bronze... that was still fine... then they got better more than myself and you know the deal... they went silver and I stayed in Iron. Now we can't play anymore. 

2) Abuse. I'm 43 and not a prude ok. But the things I hear on voice chat make me sick.

3) Hostage. More than once I've been hostage of someone that has nothing better to do that ruin other people games. Just now I've finished a 45 minute game were one decided to waste our time and (in this order):
* when attacking he would take the spike, then stay in base and tell the other team where we were going and where he was
* declined to surrender of course
* we still managed to finish 4-8 by killing their whole team 4 times and we thought we could do better in defending
* he then spent his time telling them where we were and shooting so they would know our position.
* still declined to surrender
* all this while bragging to the other team and playing load music in the background and making fun of us.

What tool do we have to fight this?
Nothing.

Reporting people doesn't let us know anything
While you are hostage, you can't leave the game or you get punished even more. You cannot kick whoever takes you hostage either. You really feel powerless.

For every decent game I had since I've not played with my friends I have experienced at least 3/4 games that sucked. This is not fun anymore. I started playing LOL and pubg again.

VALORANT,2021,1,"Hey,

my name is Phame. I want to make this diary to track my progress and also help new players to get better in this game. But with all the guides around, I won't make any guides and concentrate on the diary aspect.

**Personal Information**

I'm a 25 y.o. student from germany. In my freetime I used to play Yu-Gi-Oh! competitively, but due to the corona situation I couldn't attend any RL tournaments, so I needed a new game to grind. I have literally no experience in shooter and PC games besides small games. In general I'm a quite competitive person, so I always want to get the best possible at something I'm doing.

**How it started**

I'm not a huge gamer so I didn't want to commit to a gaming PC. As corona forced me to stay inside most of the time (germany had big lockdowns), I decided to start playing PC games. So in May 2020 I decided to buy a gaming laptop, the *Asus G14*, because my old macbook air 11"" was dying.   
My first thought was to get up to date with the large RPGs of the last decade, but that idea was shattered from the valorant hype still going on at that time. All my friends played valorant, so I joined them at the official release of this game. But how to get started? Valorant is my first shooter and my first real PC game.

Imagine me sitting on a couch and using my 60 Hz display and my Razer Viper Ultimate on my lap trying to hit someone. Well yeah, that didn't work out I realized after a few days. So I started to clean my super old working desk and used it just to play valorant.

Now I was using my laptop and mouse on the naked desk. At least it was better than the couch.  


**Progress - Act 1**

*Act Rank:* https://imgur.com/Hh0JykJ 

After my funny obligatory unranked games I started this Journey of course as Iron 1. There is where I realized, I cannot play this game casually.   
Fortunately I've started this game with 5 stacks, otherwise the toxicity of some players would have probably stopped me from playing this game. My friends were also already at bronze/silver level and much better than I was. As my competitive mindset was challenged, I've started to look up ways to get better in Valorant.

***My tip #1:*** Watch guides! Or rather watch enough guides, so you know the mechanics and knowledge you need to learn and then watch specific guides for each topic, while avoiding the clickbait guides with minimum knowledge.

I'm a type of person, who watches guides for everything in life. Cooking, cleaning, studying and gaming, I watch guides before I start something. So I watched hours and hours of guides, when I had time (for example while being transported in train or car). But watching videos won't improve anything. It will take a few months until I got my mechanics to a good basic level.

My first step to improve was to use Aimer7's Aiming guide. For that I also bought Kovaak's and started to train my aim for 1 Hour a day. I can tell you, you definitely need a goal in mind to do aimtraining. For me it is the most boring thing in this world. Even more if you don't get results immediatly. 

After a week I started to see some improvements in my mouse control and was quite happy to see minimal improvements. As I said before I never actually played something with my mouse, so my mouse control was quite bad.   
While my aimtraining was going on, I realized something important: my DPI/eDPI, which was about 400 at that time. Every time I got better with my mouse, I've got the feeling that the crosshair was too fast. So I changed my eDPI to round about 300 and got a small improvement boost. ***Don't do this, if you already found your eDPI! You will ruin your musclememory.***  
But still this will happen along my journey quite a few more times.

While my aim training was going on, I started to look at my hardware. My display is 60 Hz and 14 inch. Not optimal, but I cannot change that for now. What I could change, was my non-existent mousepad. So I got myself a nice mousepad from a local store in a decent size (about 400 mm x 400 mm) without looking at the speed of the pad. That also gave me a small boost.  
Right now I was at about Iron 3 and hitting Bronze 1 for the first time. After a few weeks into Act 1 I also reached Bronze 2, where I peaked.

**Progress - Act 2**

*Act Rank:* https://imgur.com/cXrDoTy 

My aimtraining was still going on and I had to change my eDPI while going on to 250 eDPI. Maybe someone in the comments can explain this phenomen to me, but I always got the feeling of losing control while gaining control of the mouse without lowering the sens. At least it worked for me and I broke every Personal Record day after day unti l plateaued. I was quite happy to see improvements in my aim training, but somehow it didn't transfered to Valorant. I was still stuck in Bronze.

Of course I could blame it on smurfs or bad teammates/leavers (oh boy there were many), but I wouldn't accept such excuses for myself. I've started to watch how pros are playing, tournaments and compilations of Flexninja, Average Jonas and Flights. Also I tried to remember every angle, where enemies camped me. After a while I developed a little bit of gamesense and hit Silver 1. I was soooo happy to finally reach such a milestone in my journey.   
I still had round about 4 months until the year ended and so I set my goal to reach gold 1 until end of the year. It kinda seemed possible after I reached Silver 1. At this time I also choose Omen as my main agent. One reason was Flexninjas plays, but the main reason was that literally nobody in the low elo ranks will smoke probably or even take a smoker. So I chose to take that role.

***My tip #2 is:*** Choose 1 to 2 agents, who you main and watch guides on how to play them. You don't need to tap heads, if you for example set up one way smokes. Every player in Silver and sometimes Gold will rush into them and die, often multiple times in a match.

You probably ask how I got that huge jump in ranks in my act rank at this point. Before I explain what happened, I want to note, that I was soloqueuing most of the time, because my friends lost interest in this game more and more, but I was already hooked by this game.

***My tip #3 is:*** Get your hardware down, before you even try to get better in Valorant.

Yes, I finally got an external monitor for my laptop! 24 Inch, 144 Hz. As a student my budget is quite tight, so I got the AOC 24G2. The input lag is still quite high for high level FPS, but for my use it is enough. I don't know how to explain that and it sounds like ""RGB makes your aim better"" or ""Prime Vandal is aimbot"", but I suddenly sensed all the improvements of my training all at once. I suddenly hit every single shot and my headshot rate jumped from &gt;1% to at least 10%+, it was a massacre. A normal match in Silver, where I struggled before, suddenly felt like a deathmatch. I even run and gun'ed on many occasions.  
You can even see it in the Act 2 Rank. There were only 3 Wins in Silver 3 and 7 Wins in Gold 1, 4 of them were caused by me dropping back to Gold 1, so I only had 3 games in Silver 3 and 3 games in Gold 1 until I reached Gold 2.

Welp, this was surprising as hell. I crushed my goal of reaching Gold 1 at the end of the year. With this sudden improvement I felt accomplished and I wanted to push muich further. Finally I saw the improvents of 2 months of aimtraining.   
Of course Gold 3 was also not far away and I also reached it and peaked at Gold 3 in this act. While being happy that I reached so far, I also realized the huge wall to Platin. I kept losing against any Platin Player and it seems they were 10x times better than I was. There was something I was still missing to push further.

**Progress - Act 3**

With my studies going on and me start to take a new part time job, I didn't have enough time to do aim training anymore, so I concentrated my efforts to improve my game sense and mechanical skills in valorant like counter strafing, peeking and so on. It also was probably the thing I was missing to reach Platin. 

***My tip #4 is:*** If you your aim is not great, train your gamesense and basic mechanical skills. This will easily push you into Gold/Plat and is much more important than raw aim. You don't need headshots right now, if you can caught opponents off guard with off angles or if you can read their rotations and general playstyle. Many players and more often over confident players (mostly because of their aim) will do the same thing every round and you can easily capitalize on that.

After a month of hard stucking in Gold 1 and Gold 2 something clicked in my head. My gamesense was suddenly good enough to caught enemies off guard with my rotations and flanks and now I know most common angles to check (which doesn't imply that I survive every peek). Also my crosshair placement was at headlevel every time I didn't have to swing my crosshair for more than 90 degrees.

***My tip #5 is:*** To train crosshair placement I always shoot at the wall with different ranges before every round in the buying phase and run up to the wall to check, if it was headlevel. You can always buy your weapon again, if you bought it the same round, to refill your ammo. 

At this time I also had to change my eDPI for the last time to 200 eDPI. It kinda destroyed my muscle memory, but I got it back after a week. Now it feels exactly how I want it.

My raw aim is quite bad right now, because I don't aim train with Kovaak's or Aimlabs anymore, but my crosshair placement and gamesense are carrying me super hard. And 2 weeks ago I finally reached Platin 1 with random 2-3 stacks, I found on a Valorant discord server.

I recently got a bigger screen at 27 inches, so I can see heads much easier without putting my face on the screen and I got a new mouse, the Logitech G Pro X Superlight, which also improved my mouse feeling quite a lot.

So here I am now. My act rank is Plat 2, which I'm very proud of for reaching this far.  
*Act rank:* https://imgur.com/HjV68yr 

And today I had insane matches, where I hit every shot and so I even peak at Plat 3 (notably the 22-3-1 match): https://imgur.com/DzPuvce 

***My tip #6***: Use the phantom, if you are not confident at hitting headshots. There are no and I mean NO benefits, if your aim and crosshair placement is not on point. All the Vandal vs Phantom videos are for plat or higher players, where the aim starts to be consistent. You can randomly hit a headshot, which is more luck than skill, but most of the time many players will start to spray above the head of the enemy. The phantom is **much** easier to control. You will get more kills by spray and pray with phantom than with the vandal. Of course you shouldn't spray more than 5 bullets at all most of the time, but even the 5 bullet spray is much more easier to hit than with a vandal, especially if you are not prepared to shoot, because you got surprised by an early peek.  
To train your spray you can do the same thing in tip #5. I start to shoot at head and spray down to crouch head level multiple times in the buy phase. After a while you will get a hang of it. Of course you also have to change the distance too.

***My tip #7***: Don't hold angles too close. It is frustrating to watch my mates holding angles really tight and get peek and picked, because they couldn't react fast enough. If you hold angles with at least a body width distance from the angle, you will have more time to react and also they will probably swing the angle about that width, if they don't jigglepeek the angle.

***My tip #8***: Please warm up before and after rank games. Ideally you should play some deathmatches before and after ranked games to reset your mind and aim. If you don't have much time even the Range can be enough.   
Some days your aim will be off and will require a hard reset. There I used a tip from a youtuber (Sorry I don't remember who it was), where you have to play deatchmatch with 2x of your sens to calibrate your aim again. You can do this the same way with 0.5 of your sense, depending on how off your aim feels (faster or slower). After this my aim feels normal again on those days.

My new goal is to reach Diamant 1 in the next 2 months. I think I have to start to aimtrain again, because I kinda suck at aiming freely without relying on crosshair placement. By the end of the year I hope to reach Diamant 3. I don't know, if it's possible, but I play 2 to 4 matches a day and will start aimtrain again for 30 mins a day, so I will hope for the best.

I hoped you enjoyed reading this. I did this mostly for myself, but added the tips for newer players, in the hope they will help them. You can ask me anything and I will probably answer every question, when I have time.

*Please forgive me for typos or grammar, my english is not that great tbh.*

VALORANT,2021,1,"Feel this would improve character selection by allowing you to choose up to 3 agents your team can view as your preferred. Largely beneficial to see your teams strengths and how your choice could impact the overall game before locking in. BTW - MS Paint skills OP.

EDIT - Well this blew up, thanks for all the feedback and awards! Things to add:

1. Preferred agents should be unique to each map.
2. Add approx. 15 second buffer to review agent preferences prior to lock in.
3. Unlock option (limit once per player) to allow for mutual changes.

VALORANT,2021,1,"Name: Ni Chen (Vietnamese)

Backstory: Ni Chen comes from a primal civilization located in the middle of a forest in Vietnam, out of the small population (around 300) he is the strongest among them. He uses mud/earth as his style (similar to Phoenix, Jett and Sage).

Role: Sentinel-Controller

Abilities: 

Signature move, Earth Totem (1 charge, and 45 second recharge) - Equips an earth totem imbued with his own energy, you stick it to the ground with left click and has a range a little shorter than Killjoy's Lockdown,  when put down it covers the floor withing the range (it includes walkable ramps, stairs and ground with higher or lower altitude) with a thin layer of mud that makes the enemies' footsteps louder and can be heard even when shift-walking. The totem's duartion is between 10-15 secs. and it cannot be destroyed.

2nd and 3rd ability, Mud Orb Summon (3 charges. costs 300 each) - The Mud Orb Summon is a 2 ability fuse like Reyna's Devour and Dismiss, the 2 abilities are named Shoot and Harden, when C, Ni Chen summons 3 Mud Orbs that are ready to shoot, each left click will shoot one orb and they cannot be shot all at once since it has a 0.5 seconds cooldown between each shot, upon a surface's touch, the orb will increase his size and form to a semi-perfect sphere with  2 feet radio (60 cm) once the orb gets to full size which happens instantly after it touches something, it will block allies and enemies like Sage's wall. The Mud Blocking Spheres do not melt or break with time, but have 600 hp (for reference, Sage's wall has 800 hp). If the orb touches a player it will bounce and won't activate. NOTE: when you summon the orbs, you have 8 seconds to shoot all 3 of them, if time runs out, the ramining orbs will disappear.  


When you hit Q once you hit C, the 3 orbs Ni Chen summoned will harden and can be used like Jett's knives. The hardened orbs are shot exactly as the previous ability but they do damage when a player gets hit, they do 15 damage each and will always bounce once if they touch a surface other than an enemy, they do not pierce any wall or prop.

Ultimate, Earthquake Charge - Hitting X will trigger an animation where you can see both of Ni Chen's hands on the front meaning the ulti is ready to be used, when you hit left click, Ni Chen will look towards the ground and put both of his hands on the floor for 3 seconds and when its finished, the main ability will trigger, as the name says it an earthquake, the earthquake has a range that is only visible in the Minimap and will visibly make some cracks on the floor around the range. During the Eartquake, all the enemies and allies will be affected except for you, the Earthquake will have a vibration effect on whoever is between the range, making it a bit harder to aim and will severely decrease everyone's accuracy except you, the duration for the ulti is undefined so I´m open to suggestions. Thanks",2021-01-05 06:57:20
VALORANT,2021,1,"Since riot games does not permit switching regions freely for no reason, they need to give something to the players forced to play on high ping when not on native region.  
Imagine this: You queue for a game and have a player that goes 1-20-3 the whole game and lose 13-12 as a result. You are mad throughout the match and start being toxic to that horrible shitter who is costing you the game.

Now imagine you are the horrible shitter. All you want to do is play competitive but you are constantly bullied by teammates for an uncontrollable situation. You have been relegated to buying guns to the point of not having enough for your own. They begin to report you to the authorities for an uncontrollable quality of yourself. **You have been enslaved; no different than other minority groups throughout history.** You cant stop thinking about how awful the human condition is. People tell you to stop playing ranked because you are bad and worthless, maybe even to stop playing at all. They say this so much you begin to think this is a least a little bit true. You also remember that your teammates are not entitled to any of this. Not entitled to good teammates.  


My solution(s): 

1) People with high ping need something. Perhaps being able to see people through walls, a free gun every round, automatic shooting when the player is in front of them. Any of these or all of them.  


2) People can just be nice, and not be toxic when a player is underperforming to not let the high pingers feel worse than they already do.  


3) Remove all region restrictions. Whoever thought of adding region locks is quite frankly, an idiot. What is the benefit of that?

VALORANT,2021,1,"With the new agent arriving it seems as though Riot is slowly running out of ideas for abilities that seem practical for a tactical shooter such as flashes. So I propose to you the idea of rather adding new abilities, what about some cool team ability mechanics. 

Here’s an example that came to mind for me: 

If Cypher maybe had like a keybind that could pair with his ult with Jett’s ult so whenever Jett kills an enemy with her ult the Cypher ult goes off. 

Things like this would be high risk high reward type plays. You could simply use the cypher ult and 100% confirm that you will get its use out of it...or you could play the potential of getting multiple cypher ult pings with the risk of your Jett dying without getting a kill.

VALORANT,2021,1,"Hello everyone, this post is about something we experienced yesterday. We were playing some rankeds game in low silver-high bronze. The first match, we encountered a Phoenix who was killing us with headshost while running. We thought it just luck since we were winning (something like 10-8) but then the match ended and there was no trace of it. We thought that it was because he was hacking and he got reported (we didn't even report him). So we lost 30 min of our lives and lost a match that we could have probably won, okay.

&amp;#x200B;

We got in queue once again and the match starts with a sus Reyna that lands every single headshot. We ignored it and thought that se was just better than us or just smurfing untill she started to flame us telling us how bad we are. We asked her if she was smurfing and she said she wasn't. She ended the game like 25-5 while the second of her team was something like 12-10. I don't want to say that she was hacking but in match the resume, we saw that all of us lost the duel againt her and she almost always (7 out of 8 kills) killed us with headshots.

&amp;#x200B;

I know I'm really bad at this game but it really feels frustrating to lose half an hour  and then be queued up against someone who didn't leave us room to play. I also wanted to ask, can hackers use the cheats intermittently? Sometimes it felt like she couldn't even aim while others it was impossible to do anything against her.

&amp;#x200B;

Btw, I'll leave a fun fact about the seconf match, we almost got to tie because we all bought odins and started to shoot through the walls as soon as heard footsteps lmao",2021-01-05 08:50:40

1. Text chat not disappearing in the middle of the round.

2. Big player loadouts visible over teammate heads during round after buy phase. (Obstructs vision a lot and is visible through walls. This is with the always see player loadouts setting turned off.)

The cause of these glitches:

1. You had chat open when round ended and you were spawned in for the next round.

2. You were tabbed out of the game when the buy phase barriers dropped.


I have had the fix for both of these glitches for a long time and see many players suffering from them. I’m not sure if most players know about the fixes. If they are not well known, I will make another post with their solutions. Do you guys know the fix or should I post the fixes?

Edit:

Fixes are here:

1. Open chat and your mouse cursor will also reveal itself. Hover it over any part of the chat and click your scroll wheel (Mouse Button 3). This will make the chat disappear.

I'm sorry for the dumb question but I might move to another country and was wondering if I would still be able to use my OCE created valorant account in other places, say SEA or NA. I know that you can request for a region transfer but that would mean restarting my agent unlocks and contracts while keeping only my VP.

I just finished an unrated match where pretty much the entire team except one dude was flaming me and mocking me the whole time. I was basically bullied by 3 people over voice comm for 43 minutes while simultaneously trying to play a team game. I talked to the only chill dude after the match and apparently, they were in a party, I wasn't the first random guy to complain, and they were just joking around. Intentional or not, this was the least fun match I've ever had and I've decided to play valorant less. Also lesson learned: use the mute button or quit the match sooner.

VALORANT,2021,1,"hi, been playing for about . . . 2 weeks now. fun game!

been practicing aimlab about 30min / day, and playing some games with my friends in ranked. I only got around to play phoenix right now.

the thing is I feel I don't have a good understanding of how valorant works, I've never played CS before (or any fps really), and while I am continuously improving my aims (I could see my score getting better in aimlab, and fragging a lot more in death match), I don't see the translation of my aims into a real game very often. as a result, I've been just defaulting to buying snipers (marshall or op) and just hold positions, because it felt most like an aim fight, but immediately felt useless if they don't show in the first 10 seconds, or if they covers with a smoke. most time I die it's not even that I couldn't aim at their head fast enough, it's I'm not even knowing where the hell am I, or what I should be doing. I've been just defaulting light-armour + marshall, and serving as a credit bank for my teammates (ngl I got to iron3 doing this lul).

what I need is something like a laundry list, stuff like ""okay on attack round 1, you do roll a dice and mix up A B C"" ""if you win, go here with these abilities"", ""if you lose, do this"" etc. like extremely detailed thought process on what to do. if there's some youtuber that just narrate their thought process, full gameplay vods, I'd love to just see it.

VALORANT,2021,1,"Hi,

I’m not sure if this has been addressed (probably has) but I’ve recently started playing and I’ve played through my unrated games and now doing my ranked placements and I noticed every now and then my ping would sky rocket like at the start of a round or during heavy combat scenes. But now it seems to happen all the time even when just walking or changing weapon. It can range from 100 ping to easily over 500 and it’s so frustrating! I have very good internet and don’t have this problem on any other games, is there something I’m missing or can do to help?
I’ve maxed my FPS to 100 to try and help but nothing has worked so far?
I really like the game and think it’s something I could invest into but these ping issues are very off putting, help a brother out pleaaaase!

Btw I don't have really good computer, so that is why the game is crashing, but still, Riot shouldn't ban for thing like that, or at least there should be like max. 20 minute ban.

VALORANT,2021,1,"I played CS:GO before Valorant, and there were options to play either specific practice maps (yprac) with bots placed in common spots or place bots on a map on your own server. You could then practice properly entrying a site, peeking one angle at the time and keeping as good crosshair placement as possible.

In Valorant, there are no custom maps and so far no way of just placing stationary bots on a map. Is there some other way of accomplishing something like this? Is there some ability, something that you could place throughout the map, pinging locations or something else that could be used to practice this?

To clarify: It wouldn't be as good as a stationary bot, since they wouldn't be at head height, but at least I could practice checking all spots and I normally have a fairly good idea of head height anyway.",2021-01-05 12:51:25

Smokes can turn a 5v1 fight into a 2v1 **easily**. They're absolutely pivotal! If smokes block enemies, they should earn points.

&amp;#x200B;

Maybe the Phoenix with 20 kills has more kills than the Brimstone with 15, but it was Brim's smokes that made Phoenix's firefights way easier enough to get those kills. Smokes blocking enemies should absolutely earn points because being the **Most Valuable Player** of your team is more than just getting the most kills, right?

Heck, it might do a little to solve the perception around Brimstone. Guy has the fastest deployable smokes out of all the controllers. Maybe a little credit is deserved.

VALORANT,2022,1,"I just realised that you lose 3RR for dodging games consecutively. I still hate this idea because: 

1. Your team instalocked 4 duelists

3. You recognise the name of some player who was toxic last game or is a known thrower.   
4. You've already played the same map 3 times.  

Regardless of those reasons, the third is the highlight here. It is absolutely ridiculous that I lose 3RR because I don't want to play with the same idiot who was deliberately throwing last game. Why should I be penalised for that? It's even worse when you have the morons with their names hidden, only for you to realise after they start talking shit as the game starts.  

This could all be avoided by having a similar block list feature to overwatch. A balance where you can only have a maximum of say 3 people on it so you will never get into a match with them on your team.

This habit of course would be transferred into Valorant because it also offers a significant increase in accuracy. Claiming that you’re hitbox is smaller so you’ll get shot less is a double-edged sword. Though it is true that your hitbox shrinks, typically we aim for chest-up. When you crouch, people will nearly always headshot you because your head is now located to chest level. This now allows cheap weapons to have a TTK much quicker. For example, the Spectre will get two headshots if the opponent is crouching if the initial shot was chest level. Unbind your crouch button for a month so you lose the habit of crouching.

That being the OP and I’m honestly annoyed at this point because there just seems to be no counter I was diamond and Deranked to plat 2 now I’m not saying that this is entirely the ops fault but a majority of games looked like this .



We lead the half or it goes equal 6-6 7-5 8-4 and we get a good lead then the opponent saves up the jett buys an op and boom our lead is gone we communicate flashes stuns peeks etc but nope jett just shoots away and dashes if we try to trade her? She just smokes herself and repels again with a new angle.

VALORANT,2022,1,I 100% did not choke the ace....,2022-01-01 15:50:33
VALORANT,2022,1,"So the idea behind this is to give players a choice on which side they want to start on. At the beginning of a round all players start without guns and abilities. They then have to win a knife fight against the enemy team, the winner gets to decide on which side their team is gonna start. 

When pros play a best of 3 they have map picks, but we cant really do that for competitive so if we add a knife round we could give players a bit more control over the randomness of competitive. 

The choice on which side to start on is very powerful, if you play a heavy defender sided map you have to expect to loose some rounds on attacker. But since mental is such an importent component to ranked many players succumb to the tilt and surrender before the side switch happens. 

The round would only take a minute so it doesnt really add to the lenght of a match, but since competitive games can go into overtime, time isnt really an issue.

Maybe you guys would like to share how you feel about this idea, yey,ney or maybe ?",2022-01-01 16:00:49

VALORANT,2022,1,"Hello,

We all know the ranking system and MMR is very advanced &amp; a secret formula but here are some Interesting questions regarding the rank system that we actually don't really know the answers too.

1. If someone wants your skin, &amp; you request it &amp; they buy you the skin, then you swap skins does that effect your eco/economy rating? your asking for a weapon every round to give someone else the skin, does that lowers/highers your rating depending on if your the buyer or receiver.
2. if you use your cypher ult &amp; it displays 5 players instead of 3 because two of them are not dead, does that benefit you more or is it based how many people are killed within a 20 second time limit after displaying where the enemies are?
3. Killing people with different weapons in the same round.
4. If you place your sage wall &amp; the enemies fire bullets at the wall does the system detect your defending? depending on if the bombed is planted?
5. if you cancel the omen ultimate so your able to see where the enemies are does the cancel have a negative effect?
6. when you flash someone does a flash record when it flashed them? &amp; do you have to kill them within a certain time period? or If you flash for your team mate &amp; he gets the kill does that benefit you more then you getting the kill?

Keep the questions coming, lets try and work some of them out &amp; they is no right or wrong answer to anything, &amp; the ranking system is way more complex then people think.

In my experiences, If you get less deaths then your enemies or allies that seems to be a big factor &amp; also if the enemies are higher ranked then you that also seems to be a big factor.",2022-01-01 20:10:45
VALORANT,2022,1,Is this lag? Sometimes a I throw a Reyna lure and it doesn’t throw and it doesn’t register or put up a sage wall.

VALORANT,2022,1,"I'm namely talking about the following things:

**r.OneFrameThreadLag (1|0)**  

&gt; Whether to allow the rendering thread to lag one frame behind the game thread (0: disabled, otherwise enabled) 

**r.FinishCurrentFrame (1|0)**  

&gt; If on, the current frame will be forced to finish and render to the screen instead of being buffered. This will improve latency, but slow down overall performance.

A good way to fix that would be allowing her to trigger her passive only when her ultimate is active. This way she would not directly lose it and it would still be useful when she needs it the most - during her ultimate.

VALORANT,2022,1,"I've been playing Valorant on and off since release, usually starting at Diamond 2-3 and working my way up into the Immortal ranks before I lose interest.

My raw aim is decent to good judging by Kovaaks scores and my reaction time on [humanbenchmark.com](https://humanbenchmark.com) averages out between 160-170ms with peaks of 140ms reactions and dips to 180ms

A recurring annoyance I have whenever I play Valorant is my inability to hold angles. I have to position my crosshair ridiculously far to hit shots on people running into me.

Watching back my footage it usually takes me around 16 frames at 60fps to react to a peek. That's 256ms and seems atrociously bad to me.

Does anybody else by chance count the frames it takes them to react to peeks so I can compare? Is 16 frames in-game reaction time normal and holding angles statically is just not a thing in Valorant?

I don't follow the proscene at all and there is still no replay function for me to study VODs, so I'm unsure if I'm just trying to do the impossible here and holding angles statically is just trash?",2022-01-01 21:46:58

I've been playing for a few months on and off but I recently decided to actually try and be good at the game instead of getting carried by my friends, and on top of that I've never played a game with mechanics that are similar at all. I've got most things down fundamentally but one of the few things outside of needing to just ""get better"" that consistently gets me killed is moving while also trying to shoot. 

This is just something I picked up playing stuff like Apex and COD - traditional FPS's - but I really need help trying to break this habit.

Also, it's not like I'm trying to run and gun or anything my issue is more shooting JUST BEFORE I stop moving which ends up effecting my accuracy.

don't panic .its a good thing.now its time to retaliate &amp; do the same thing to them.

things to do now.

don't die , make swift calls to fall back and retake , don't waste unnecessary utilities , control the back site-important 
( plz add if anything more in below comments. this is my first season &amp; my first fps)

things not to do.

camp inside site and get triple peeked ,  wasting slow orbs , nades ,blinds ( retake is different from 'giving time for your team to rotate') , retaking without coordination.
add more in comments.

how to execute retake???

VALORANT,2022,1,"I was thinking that it might be useful if there was a way to indicate without voice that I'm about to flash/smoke a location. This could be useful in communication settings where audio isn't possible/working or when I have to mute teammates. As well, it would be a nice indicator for my team that they can understand and react to quickly!

E.g. pinging that you're going to throw a flash over a wall so your teammates immediately know to peek without having to clutter voice comms/give another indicator so the team can work together more smoothly. I think it would help especially in ranked/solo q so that you can coordinate more on the fly with random teammates.  


Anyone else think this would help communication?",2022-01-02 08:43:57

VALORANT,2022,1,"So I am in the range have put a metronome on and I am trying to shoot the sheriff at the beat of the metronome.If the bullet holes are making just a big hole without outside variance it means it's that bpm , if I go too fast bullets start to go outside that hole.

I am shooting the sheriff correctly but I am not sure I am following the bpm metronome or hearing it correctly, I have a terrible ear for music.

My observation says standing is 125 bpm.Crouched  you can shoot a little bit faster and I think its 135 bpm.

Can someone confirm , or be more accurate?

Rihanna - Only Girl is 125 bpm but it seems to fast  
Rihanna - Don't Stop The Music is 125 bpm but that seems to work I really don't know need some help.

edit:Someone said for Deagle in CSGO""The ideal tap interval for the Deagle is 0.55s(this is true for all pistols)This results in an ideal BPM of 60/0.55 = **109.1 BPM**Staying Alive is 103 BPM""

VALORANT,2022,1,"As the title suggest I've upgraded monitors, Acer Predator XB252Q (24.5"") to Asus ROG XG27AQM (27""). I've also transitioned from CSGO, playing at 4:3 on 1280x960 res (stretched).

Now I know there isn't any gain playing stretched in Val, it's more preference, but I thought I'd share this in case anyone else wanted to try it.

I'm not enjoying native res and playing on 27"" with the monitor further back feels wrong, normally I have the monitor right in front of my face. I know I could just return the monitor and stick with the 24"" but I wanted an all rounder, God of War is coming out and I can't wait to use this to it's full potential.

So I ended up changing aspect ratio through the monitors os to 16:9 (24""w)

In CS I have casted for: UCC, GameFace, NerdStreetGames, CEVO, ChallengerMode and others.So far in Valorant I have done:  30Bombgg, UK University Valorant and Valorant Cash Cup.

I'm not looking to get paid although that would be a bonus if that's possible, but I am mainly looking for experience. As my Ingame knowledge grows, so will my casting/commentating.

My mic is an Audio Technica AT2020 + Scarlet 2i2.Am able to do interviews and pre-match talk as well as provide some animated graphics for teams/players introductions.

VALORANT,2022,1,I was looking at some of the skins I own and noticed that the previews for some skins matched the theme for some characters. We can all agree based off the Versus//Sage VS Omen calling card that Sage and Omen are opposite/Enemies. For the weapon skin packs of Ruination and Sentinels of light the background of the guns shows two figures dueling. One in the light and one from the dark. If you look at the previews for each of the skins you notice that Sage is the character used to show the upgrade variants for Sentinels of light while Omen is used to show Ruinations. This might explore the divide between both characters or Im think too much into it. Anyway that’s just something cool I noticed.,2022-01-02 15:28:03

VALORANT,2022,1,"So a few hours ago I played an unrated game, in an attempt to warm up to play comp. about two or three rounds in the enemy team says “knife fight mid” and 3/5 members on my team agree. For the next 10 or so rounds my team called out where to meet and those who wanted too had a knife fight. Well the issue is that I was genuinely trying to play and warm up, so after *both* teams realized I wasn’t on board for knifing, my team started calling out my location for the enemy to kill me so that they could go back to knifing again. Only after the other person on my team who didn’t want to knife Alt+f4’ed did the enemy decided they wanted to play normally again. Needless to say -being a person down- we lost. But that’s beside the point. 

I asked multiple times (3 I think) during the game in all chat if we could play normally cause I wanted to warm up, and both teams laughed it off and continued to give away my and my other sane teammate’s location so the others could knife fight. I reported everyone who was giving away locations in game, but I’ve never seen that actually do anything. 

Is there any way to actually convince these kinds of people to just play the game normally, or should I just follow suit and also alt+f4? I ended up just giving up after that game and never even playing any ranked as I had planned too, cause I was too frustrated to play.

Hello everybody! Hope you are doing well

Chamber's addition to game felt like a breath of fresh air. I wanted a sentinel to play on Split, but was getting too bored to play the extremely passive style of KJ. So now, I am a Chamber main on split :D

That's not the main point tho. The main point is, we got free Sheriff and OP skins! (kinda). I love the headhunter so much. Its elegance, its sound, everything. It also gives the 'skin buff' like if its an actual sheriff skin.

So, to show my appreciation towards Riot and Chamber, I created the headhunter with cardboard and paper. It took me about a week and a half of work. The design had to be simplified for my own convenience, please don't mind

Materials used: i) Cereal box cardboard, ii) Colored paper, iii) Chamber's permission

VALORANT,2022,1,"So today I was zoning out and thinking of a new Valorant skin collection. Now since we already got the snowfall this wouldn't really make sense but I think it's a good idea. So the name could just be winter wonderland 2.0 or snowfall 2.0 and it would be a premium skin with animations. Now I haven't thought of a model for the guns but for the knife I think it should be another candy cane but instead of an axe animation it would be a dagger animation (reaver knife, glitchpop dagger, etc.) or like the prime karambit and the long part of the candy cane could be pointy which I just did to my candy cane I'm eating right now. For the kill banners it could maybe be a Santa shushing with his finger or Rudolph. The finisher could be like Santa's sleigh moving in a circle around the dead body in the air and dropping presents down that disappear after a second and also right when they die a ""ho ho ho"" sound effect plays. And for the kill sounds I don't really have a good idea for this but it could be like a jingle from a bell.",2022-01-02 17:06:34

VALORANT,2022,1,"It’s 2022, and that means it’s time for me to address what I’ve learned over the past almost two years of playing this game like it’s my religion (Can’t believe May is 4 months away).

Now what I’m addressing here is the subclasses of certain agents in their respective roles (And yes I’m covering my take on the duelist especially.)

Now if there’s anything this game and it’s agents have taught me, it’s that there’s a subtype of each individual role, especially considering that I’ve watched how different people play, I’ve learned agents are meant to play in different playstyles.

We’ll address Sentinels first - Seeing the addition of Chamber to the game has taught me one thing - We have those meant for defending a site post plant and helping to make it easier to hold said site (Looking at Sage and Killjoy here.) Following this we have a hybridized Agent of sorts, somebody who can hold down a site on defense and also watch flank on attack (Looking at Cypher!!) Finally we have the other end, one specifically for watching flank and playing to hold onto map control, however, they may struggle to hold onto a site on their own and stall, and might need support to hold a site (Where Chamber may reside, KEYWORD - MIGHT).

Sentinel TLDR - KJ + Sage - Site Defender; Cypher - Hybrid Defender/Flank Watcher; Chamber - Primary Flank Watcher, Might need support on Site Defense (KEYWORD MIGHT)

Next we’ll look at Initiators, the ones who make the calls for pushing a site typically. I have these divided into a 3 Subclass Set - Intel, Team Players, and Entries. Falling into Intel we have Sova, His kit is well known as the solution to any site clear prior to entry. Team player agents is reserved specifically for Breach. Although strong, his abilities are meant to be played off of by a team mate to clear site. Entries go to Skye and Kay/O. I’m sorry but if Chamber can tell Kay/O’s team he wants to play and Kay/O says ‘No lol’ then It’s kind of a given. Skye is a given due to her specific kit that allows her to keep a site clear.

Duelists are next on the list. As a primary Controller main I can confirm from my 5 Stacks that, and hear me out on this, NOT ALL DUELISTS CAN ENTRY!!!

For starters, we’ll go over the Space Makers, those meant to entry - Looking at you Raze and Jett Mains. However, ask your team to make it easier to push out, this is more than smokes, flashes, intel - you help your duelists entry, you’ll get a win

Next up is the Supporting Duelists, People who help with making the space clear and clearing site. These are the ones who will not always be the best alone, but can be amazing with their team. I’m looking at Phoenix and Yoru. Great distractions with a gate crash and ult and also the ability to blind nerds on site.

Then we have the, well, duelist subtype. She excels in fighting opponents one on one, and can do so extremely well. This is Reyna, I’d reserve her to lurking after the push onto site, not before.

Finally, we’re looking at controllers. We’ll focus on the 2 Subtypes I’ve noticed - The Outplayers and the Co-Ops.

Outplayers are the Controllers who have a kit to prevent the spike from being defused and or planted to begin with. This description fits Astra and Omen. Astra’s pull and concussive abilities are enough to prevent enemies from wanting to finish the defuse on the first touch, or even the plant. Meanwhile, you hear an Omen tp that ain’t your team’s? Yeah, double check the site for a little shadow and then you’ll try aga— Why can’t I see or hear?

Co-Ops belong to Brim and Viper. You need to coordinate with your team to have these agents work and excel in their roles. Viper’s lineups require post plant and keeping her safe till then. Brim’s stim and setup for post plant require his team too!

I’d love to have a discussion on this with y’all! Let me know what you think!",2022-01-02 18:09:53

However some of the ""fixes"" I see suggested in this sub are mind boggling. Such as:

""Deathmatches need less people"" ????. Have you never even played a minute on split or breeze? You spend more times on those maps appreciating the scenery than actually fighting other players.

""They need to fix getting killed from behind"". There is no way to fix this, suck it up, it happens in CS too. The problem arises when there's a 3 second respawn timer and you don't actually fight anyone because riot has weird fixed spawns that spawn people in corners instead of where the actual action is.

Here is what I propose: 12-20 players depending on map size (ascent does NOT need 20 people lmfao).

24/7 servers with people being able to join mid DM. Remove the radar and leaderboard.

Make footsteps only audible when a player is in your immediate vicinity.

AR'S AND OPS ONLY, sorry if your are a judge god or spectre warrior but no one else is tryna deal with that we just want to warm up our aim.

Pistol only/Garduin Only servers.

VALORANT,2022,1,"At the start of a round (comp), my game went completly black exept the UI. I could hear the voice chat and talk back, but I couldn't click on anything.

This bug I had in the recent few weeks already a few times, which resulted in me to restart the game. However today I decided to maybe let the game recover and it did. When it recovered (After 20 sec or so) I saw all enemy utility, which in my opinion I shouldn't have the info for it.

Im now curious if anyone else had that issue already. I asked myself if that bug is reproducable you could basically spy on enemies abilities position each round and the Vanguard wouldn't trigger. If this is really a bug (which I think it is) this should definetly be fixed.

Sadly I couldn't record it, as my Shadowplay crashed aswell.

VALORANT,2022,1,"hey guys.

first off, i’m not claiming i’m good- the opposite even, i’m not that good. i am a bronze 2 player- usually i play with people on my level.

today i was in the most frustrating comp game ever. the thing is- it wasn’t their lack of kills or anything that was an issue but their complete ignorance of any communication was SO frustrating. 

for example- i died to jett in elbow- so i call out she’s there. around 4-5 times. nobody checks elbow. they go to A instead- jett plants on B- but my teammates STAY on A. i call it out- no reaction (i typed it out in chat! everyone can see except for chat banned people but they weren’t because they talked in chat previously) 

next round, kay-o gets kills- starts defusing bomb- it’s a little tight but i KNOW he has it. he stops mid defuse and runs away to save… 

kay-o takes the spike- we enter site- clear it- he does not plant it. instead he walks around into mid to go get kills.

They talked about getting kills- they only wanted kills. But that’s literally never enough to win comp. 

i try talking to them, strategizing- making callouts- not one of them reacted to what i was saying. it was so frustrating. 


What do i even do in this situation?",2022-01-03 03:36:00
VALORANT,2022,1,"By this I dont mean best Agents for SoloQ   
I mean best agents for roles.  


Like lets say I main skye or sova  
But theres already an initiator player, a sentinel, 2 duelists but no smokes  
Who should I play as smokes?  


What are the essential roles, like what should u learn to play in order to make sure ur team is ok  


Like if theres no duelist (probably never will happen) should u learn to play duelist? if so who? (yes i know this depends on playstyle just hypothetically)  


Like if theres no sentinel/smoke who are best chars for soloq? if it depends on ur playstyle can i get help from sentinel and controller players on how to figure out which controller should u play in soloq or in general?  


Excuse me If i am asking for a bit much but lately my teams have been missing either a sentinel or smoke causing me to lose rr sometimes, and when i try and play this foreign agent style idk the tips and tricks to do, I either do shit wrong or am too aggro and cause a loss.

VALORANT,2022,1,"Hey everyone


So for the past couple of months, I was a hardstuck iron. Used to play agents like sage, omen, viper etc. Everytime I land into agent selection screen, Jett was instalocked already, that's why I never got to play jett before. But in the recent times, people have started to not immediately pick jett sometimes. So once no one picked jett and we had a balanced agent pick, so I picked jett for the first time. And now I just can't play any others agents better than jett lol. Like I used to play CSGO a lot before and I used AWP a lot, so i tried to use Operator as Jett and damn I've clutched several times with an OP. And as I'm learning to go back to cover if I whiff my shots, it's easier to dash and go back to cover now. And yesterday, I finally ranked up to bronze after playing jett most of the time(not by instalocking though). It ain't much but it's honest work. But I think I got to learn a lot about mastering jett as it gets harder and harder as I rank higher. So drop all the jett tips you guys have learnt or want to teach me and others in the comments below.

VALORANT,2022,1,"Alright, so before you strike this idea down hear me out.

Competitive Spike Rush would act in a similar way to a short match in CS:GO it would keep its score limit, but with overtime. This would allow it to be a quick, but sometime intense match.

Now you may ask, “what about the overpowered stuff in Spike Rush? Like the golden gun!” Well I think things like the golden gun would actually add a completely new element. Imagine the weird map control and on the fly strategy you’d have to come up with. Chamber might need to be changed a bit tho lol

VALORANT,2022,1,"Thought I might share some of the things that I've seen people do which loses them rounds or game control in general.

I'm in a position where I can go through the ranks relatively quickly, quickly enough where I can experience each MMR. Before anyone asks, I'm not a smurf (level 50~) and I used to play CS:GO (ESEA leagues etc) so I'm not a stranger to competitive FPS games. However, this is the first Act I've played properly (over 10 games). 

Here's a breakdown of each rank I've been in:

**Silver**

I got silver 2 since I lost my first 5 placement matches playing with some friends. The MMR was a bit screwed up since we were versing plats and my friends are all silver, so my account was probably creating imbalances. 

The biggest issue here is not aim but no utility usage. I'm also partly to blame for this as I only played Reyna (and barely even used her flash). Players in this MMR don't have the best game sense either, so utility will be more effective in this rank. There was also not much comms when I solo queued which was frustrating. I think if you're able to effectively call out information, players will naturally listen, unless they're on purposely being a pain. 

Other than that, this MMR also has quite a few smurfs, on either sides. It's just something we have to deal with unfortunately. 

To get out of silver:

* Don't focus too much on kills (although it's good to have great aim), focus on gamesense and ability usage. Smoke (or tell others) to smoke off things like heaven or link etc. 
* Try and communicate with people. I'd say most people are down to listen provided you're not making bad calls or doing bad plays yourself while micromanaging others. A simple ""lets rotate back to A and smoke heaven"" is enough to win rounds. 
* Understand what economy is. Don't force on bad rounds like the 2nd round after losing pistol. Better to wait for 3rd with a full buy. 
* Learn proper cross hair placement. 

**Gold**

I skipped to gold 2 after 4-5 wins in silver. 

The issues I saw in gold are similar to silver, but people generally have better aim and better utility usage. I think the biggest issue here is that most people don't really know how to play their roles effectively. For example, initators not initiating for their duelists, duelists hanging back or being the last to enter a site. I think the best thing to do in this scenario is just to give a friendly reminder to your teammates ie ""Breach do you mind flashing into site for me as I dash in every round, thanks"". 

This MMR also has quite a few smurfs, but players in this MMR seem to use their mics more. There are also some pretty decent aimers in this MMR but they're hardstuck because you can only do so much with aim. 

To get out of gold:

* Repeat of silver - focus on utility use, comms and economy. 
* Newly added: Try and play to your role, and encourage others to do so too. Duelists/initiators need to be proactive and not play like controllers/sentinels, controllers/sentinels don't need to play like duelists/initators. In my mind, ideally the initiators and duelists should be working with eachother the most. There is honestly nothing more satisfying than having an initiator make entrying more bearable for their duelists, which the controllers/sentinels set up for a retake/lurk. Obviously there's no cookie cutter way of how the team should play but in general, players in this MMR don't really mesh together.
* Learn proper cross hair placement. 

**Platinum**

I personally think this is where the game kind of starts. Most of my games had multiple people with mics and the information often helped a lot. Players in this MMR also can be pretty good aimers (towards plat 3) which caught me by surprise. The thing that is still lacking is still an understanding of roles within the team, although I'd say most players are starting to play to their roles. 

The thing that seems to separate players who know how to carry in this MMR are now more pointing towards raw aim and better gamesense. This is assuming that these players already know roughly what their role needs to do. 

Game sense is a huge thing, it's more evident in platinum and above because it becomes increasingly hard to carry through just pure aim and ability usage, unlike lower MMRs. An example of game sense would be predicting where their lurker might be, or knowing how a particular enemy plays. Everyone has their own playstyle, for example, if the enemy team likes to push a lot, you can easily counteract that by playing slower and setting up util/holding advantageous angles. I've gone from 2-11 to 13-11 just because we figured out that if we play slow (or play super fast), the enemy can rarely adapt. I've also lost a bunch of games because the enemy changed their strategy to counter our playstyle. Unfortunately, sometimes it's impossible to get everyone in the team on the same page.

This MMR has less smurfs, but the smurfs seem to always be insanely good, like immortal+. However, it's also easier to counter smurfs if your team has good comms and knows how to play their roles. I also do find boosted players in this MMR (and probably in gold/silver too) but it's just way more obvious in this MMR. I've seen a fair few players who still aim at the ground or not understand their role in this mmr. In general, your aim should be sufficiently good enough where you can hold your own and climb even if you're solo queuing in plat. 

To get out of platinum:

* Repeat of gold, although your aim should be pretty good by the time you're high plat. 
* Develop game sense, try and understand how the enemy team are thinking and try counter it. Momentum is a huge thing is this game, so a few won rounds could mean the W. Seriously, don't just play the same losing strat every round and expect something to happen. Catch their lurkers off guard, learn who likes to push/hold.


**Diamond**

I feel like there are two sides of diamond. Low diamond (mostly low diamonds with a couple of plat 3s) and high diamond (all d2+ with immortals in the mix). Low diamond is pretty much the same as high plat so nothing new there. However, in diamond lobbies where everyone was d2+, I felt a huge difference in gameplay. I would say that my raw aim is my biggest strength but I felt like there were just better players with worse aim outduelling me. This is because they have better game sense than I do, and know how to use their util better. Players in this MMR generally know how roles work and it's rare to see baiting duelists or what not. 

I've seen a few smurfs in this MMR and from what I can tell, they all have a very good sense of gameflow and just seem to know how everyone plays - on top of cracked aim. In the lower MMR's, a Jett updrafting would probably mean a free kill for me but some of the Jett's ive seen in this MMR will insta one-tap you during their updraft. 

Something else I've noticed is that lobbies seem to be kind of uneven, there always seems to be one team which is much stronger than the other.

Building further, we can use a soft-lock and a hard-lock system. 
In the first phase (like 5 seconds is given to each person to choose sequentially), everyone takes turns soft-locking their agent. Meaning, they basically have the agent and nobody else is allowed to take it. 


In the second phase, which would be like 30 seconds, people can discuss if they wanna swap or strats they wanna use. And then hard lock their agent.",2022-01-03 08:29:02

VALORANT,2022,1,"I recently switched from the Logitech G900 after 4 years of use to the Razer Viper Mini \~5 days ago. I have smaller hands (\~6.2 inches length, \~4 inches width). I used to play on a high eDPI (\~1200) whilst fingertip gripping my G900, but I was told by many this is very wrong. I'm now down to 400 eDPI whilst practicing on AimLab the last few days, but it feels like I've transitioned to a weird almost-palm grip (the top part of my palm is touching the mouse bump instead of hovering) because of this lower eDPI.

My fellow fingertip grippers, do you mind sharing your eDPI values with me, and if they are as low as 400, if you have any pointers to share? I ask because apparently most pros are at around 200 eDPI and idek how.

Quick side note, if someone can correct me if I'm wrong, but is fingertip gripping actually: you're moving your mouse mostly through your fingers in the Y-axis, and your wrist mostly in the X-axis?",2022-01-03 09:23:47

I looked on the Valorant Fandom to see if there was an answer to this question but there wasn't.

I'm not talking about a passive similar to jett's, but about passives which can defuse the spike quicker, plant the spike quicker, gain a small amount of health per kill, a small amount of ammo per kill etcetera.

VALORANT,2022,1,"Hi everyone ! I imagine you are aware, but a preview of the next character ""Neon"" has been leaked. I had time to waste so before it released, I had a bit of fun speculating on her gameplay knowing that the character is centered on the theme of speed. So here is a list of the abilities that I would like to see on the character (the names are sheap but I'm quite proud of them :)):

&amp;#x200B;

\*\* Signature ability \*\*: \* Sprinter \*

Neon lowers his arms and sprints. For a few seconds her movement speed increases greatly, sudden damages are reduced (well, you shoot her in the head with a marshal she dies, would be fair). In return, Neon is no longer able to use his weapons and abilities during this time. The sprint can be canceled at any time.

   One could imagine a sort of Yoru's ult by removing invincibility and invisibility. I think that would be a great signature ability for the character. It's not too strong as she doesn't become invincible, and speed wouldn't stop a good player from killing her with a bullet to the head during her run. A rather good repositioning capacity I find.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\* Ability 1 \*\*: \* light speed \*

After a short while, Neon instantly moves a short distance in front of her (Tracer's dash if you want) creating a blinding flash in her path.

I like this ability because it involves both the management of a flash, which is difficult in Valorant, but also a quick repositioning. The ability seems fun to use, so inexperienced players would use it recklessly and find themselves cornered on their own after poor repositioning, as it wanted to blind opponents. A capacity that ultimately requires strategy and self-control.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\* Ability 2 \*\*: \* Futuristic shoes \*

This ability can only be bought once in the entire game. After buying it for a rather large sum of money, Neon unlocks a passive that can be activated and deactivated at any time with a short channel. Once activated, Neon's general movement speed (walking, running, lowered, knife in hand) is increased. She is still able to use her weapons, but on the other hand, she is no longer able to use either her signature ability, ability 1, or ultimate ability.

I imagine this ability to be bought rather in the second half of the game, because I also imagine it to be rather expensive. This would make the character quite unique because no other character has a passive ability like that it seems to me, and it would give a big depth of gameplay because it would give the player the choice to favor either a basic use of a character from Valorant, or to favor gunplay which would be favored by an increasement in movement speed (it would therefore become more aggressive).

&amp;#x200B;

\*\* Ultimate Ability \*\*: \* Now I'll show you! \*

After channeling in the direction of enemies, Neon disappears and reappears on the other side of the targeted group, inflicting, in the process, damage equivalent to 50% of the missing life points to the targeted players.

I was inspired by both Malthael's Ultimate Ability in Heroes of the Storm and Master Yi's Ability 1 in League of Legends.

   Again, it seems very fun but it's actually very tricky. Not only does this imply a dangerous repositioning, but also and above all uncertain damages. To kill someone with this ult, you have to be sure that their HP is below 50% (I don't know if it's better to concider shield) and you all know that Valorant is not very generous in information on HPs. But imagine for a second a quintuplet with that ... Can you imagine how hard that would be to put together, and how satisfying it would be to get there?

&amp;#x200B;

In short, I clearly imagined a duelist.",2022-01-03 15:16:28

VALORANT,2022,1,"Hey everyone, not sure if this is just my imcompetence, but I think Phoenix's blind is a little too situational, and I think there is a cool intuïtive way to increase it's usefulness (for me):

At tapping the trigger, the blind is thrown as usual;

When pressing and holding the trigger, the length of the arch (and, possibly, the length of the blind?) increases until the trigger is let go (with a maximum ofcourse), at which point the blind is thrown with the increased arch and length.

This would make Phoenix viable at more corners of more maps, while taking a bit of risk (having to be vulnerable while taking the time to charge the blind), and retaining cool quick snappy blind at tapping the blind.

Would this work and why (not)? Or am I just too bronze to realise Phoenix doesn't need a buff?",2022-01-03 16:04:33

VALORANT,2022,1,"Markdown

Sentinel

Passive (About time another passive was added!) - All weapons are 100 credits cheaper for Markdown only.

Ability 1 - (Name undecided, help in comments) A decent-sized pad is placed on the ground instantaneously that is almost invisible (like cypher utility) that, when triggered by Markdown, throws the enemies and allies (including Markdown!) back 5-10 meters. Single target, decent radius. 1 Charge. 

&amp;#x200B;

Ability 2 - Resignation - Ability is a small orb that can be dropped, and allies (or enemies if left out in the open) can pick it up to regain their signature ability instantly. Ex. Regain an Astra star, Jett dash, Sage heal. CANNOT be picked up by Markdown. Can only be placed once per round. 1 Charge.

&amp;#x200B;

Ability 3 - Deposit - Markdown drops a small bag full of cash on the ground containing 2000 credits (taken from Markdown's current balance) that allies can interact with and take 500, 1000, or all 2000 credits. Can only be used BEFORE the round starts. Multiple allies can take 500. Ex. ally 1 could take 500 for their utility, ally 2 could take 1000 and 500 for a ghost and heavy shields. Can be used once at the start of every round if the 2k are available. Any leftover credits are sent back to Markdown's balance after the round starts.

Ultimate - 7 Ultimate Points - Buyout - Markdown's ultimate immediately takes the most expensive gun currently in play (on the enemy team) and gives it to him. Doesn't matter if it's a shorty or operator, as long as it's worth the most. The gun is removed from Enemy 1's hands and given to Markdown (spawned in front of him if he already has a primary / secondary)Great ultimate for both save rounds and anti-operator.

Welcoming any thoughts, comments, or suggestions. I think an eco-related agent might be a good change in pace with Valorant, and the agent doesn't have much to make the game overly enjoyable or annoying.

NOTE: I was a bit hesitant to make this agent a Sentinel, as it's only defensive ability being the pressure plate. I felt that the eco related abilities did make it a great support character. If you have any suggestions on how this agent's first ability could be changed, please list them.",2022-01-03 19:54:17

I recently lost interest in Valorant as it doesn't seem realistic for me to push Radiant as a college student, however I feel that I have some insight on climbing through the ranks in Valorant. I am aware I am probably the 100th person on this sub to make a post like this, but I feel very strongly that 90% of people who complain about ranked have a bad mindset.

First of all let me make it clear that if you are hardstuck, which I would define as being at the same rank for more than 2 acts, then you do not have a good mindset. You aren't losing because of your teammates. The only common denominator in all of your games is you. If you really deserve a better rank then you have to make a difference in your games. This doesn't mean you have to be PMA and I'm not saying every game is winnable. The key to getting out of elo hell is winning the games that you don't expect to.

About 20% of your games are unwinnable, no matter what you do. On the other hand, about 20% of your games are free. The remaining 60% are up to you. A lot of people claim that climbing is impossible in solo queue, and that their teammates are always bad but this is just self-serving bias. Just think about it.

If the players in your rank are so bad, then you should benefit from it. You have 5 randoms on the enemy team and 4 on your team, so there are more instances where the other team has god awful players than instances where you do. What people don't realize is while sometimes you get unlucky games the way the majority of people rank up is through a lucky winstreak. 

If you want to rank up, stop complaining and focus on yourself. Just because the matchmaking is random doesn't mean it is unfair, you have to focus on yourself and if you consistently perform well and make good calls you will win.

Edit: A few people seem to think that it is more accurate to say you have a 10% affect on all of your games because there are 10 players. This may be true, but it still doesn't invalidate the rest of the post. Even if you can only do so much, by playing really well you will make a difference in those games that could go either way.",2022-01-03 21:09:02

VALORANT,2022,1,"Hello Reddit and [r/VALORANT](https://www.reddit.com/r/VALORANT/),

My compatriot [ace0k](https://www.reddit.com/user/ace0k/) created a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/rs2rso/ukrainian_localization_in_league_of_legends/) about the Ukrainian localization in the popular game League of Legends. Of course, I do not require separate servers for Ukraine, as Ukraine is located in the center of Europe, but again, Riot needs to create a Ukrainian localization for their games, and now I am addressing the **Valorant** community (CS: GO has had it for a long time). 

There are 2.5 million Ukrainians in the United States and Canada, damn, Riot can turn to the studios of Ukraine themselves. There are more native speakers of Ukrainian than Polish. Ukrainian is the eighth most common language in Europe, not like Belarusian, which is an endangered language.

**I hope Raiot will hear us. 🇺🇦**

For example, in Apex you not only get a charm, but a dive trail for reaching a high rank. In League, you get ranked borders AND a skin for reaching Gold or above. In Overwatch, you get to spend ranked competitive points on Golden guns for heroes you play.

Getting a ranked buddy that says your rank with the episode on the back is underwhelming, especially for the people that grind for hundreds of hours throughout the episode.",2022-01-04 03:07:24

VALORANT,2022,1,"If you didn't already know, there is a room in the basement floor of the range that presumably is used by Brimstone. You can reach it by turning left from the shooting range, then going right and down the stairs. Then go right again, left, and the door to the room is on the right. I just found the room, and while other people seem to have known about it for a while, there is new information.

In the room is a laptop, a cell phone, and a record player, all of which you can interact with. The record player was probably there when the room was originally discovered, but the laptop and cellphone don't appear to have been based on research by yours truly.

If you interact with the laptop, an email from Sage to Brimstone appears. The email mentions radiant training, Reyna, and references Agent 19. On the phone, there are 2 voicemails. The first is from Chamber, also referring to Agent 19. In the voicemail, we learn that Agent 19 currently works for Kingdom and they are looking to get her to turn sides. The second voicemail is from Killjoy, about data on radianite explosion from a company called Everett Lindt (?), and how even though they failed they can still learn a lot from it. However, seeing what it did to the scientists working on it, Killjoy get emotional.

This is all just the gist of what I found in the room, it would be better to check it out for yourself. If somebody else already posted about this, apologies for repeating old info! I assume that the Valorant creators update this room with different information occasionally, however I don't actually know. Either way, have fun checking it out!

VALORANT,2022,1,"So I just played in an immortal 1-3 lobby and we had no smokes. We won defense on split 10-2 winning our aimduels and holding site pretty well, and then on attack, we lost 11 rounds in a row to lose 13-10. I'm confident that in immortal the teams should be even and that every player has some decent skill but getting smashed 11 rounds in a row isn't fun. If we just had 1 smoke then we could've gotten on to site but they had viper on a and brimstone, killjoy on b, and sage mid. That literally makes it impossible to even get bomb down and we just got beaten everywhere. This is just a light suggestion I'm just mad that the game ended like that.",2022-01-04 07:12:15

I'm no dummy, I understand the point of the system as it is, it creates that ""FOMO"", if you don't buy a skin you love when its in the featured collection, you may never see it again, or it'll just take a really long time.

VALORANT,2022,1,"Hello all, this is just a quick test to see if any improvement is noticeable while running Valorant.   
For all of the tests I went  with the same graphic settings:  
TL;DR: It helps performance by a bit\*

Now let's see if GPU acceleration and game mode affects the game performance.   
(These are settings you can find on your w10 OS, not sure if w11  has this function).

* Practice no bots

* My conclusion: We can see some improvement here and there, in some cases the render latency is doubled without the GPU and GM activated, from 0.3 ms to 0.6 ms. (DM)
* In the practice room with and without bots we can see almost no difference.

&amp;#x200B;

Is this noticeable in game? I'm not an expert, I would like to see some experienced players comment on this and hopefully give some feedback on whether we should enable or disable.  


Note: On the FPS I would like to ignore the results cause they are very volatile , this test was not conducted to check FPS performance however we can see a little bit of a boost. 

Let me know your thoughts.

VALORANT,2022,1,"So I'm a Silver Astra main who recently deranked to Bronze after a series of tilted matches. I should not have played ranked that day. Lost 220 rr in a day.

But that's not what I want to talk about. A few weeks ago, I saw a comment in an Immortal AMA thread telling me to unbind crouch until I reached Diamond, and I decided to try this out. I was in Bronze 3 at the time, and heavily relied on crouch spraying.

After taking this advice, I learned how to strafe shoot, and I always tried to tap the head instead of crouching and spraying my entire magazine at them the second I saw the enemy. Ranked upto Silver 2 in two weeks. After a certain depressing incident one day, I turned to Valorant to drown my pain, and everything felt off but I continued to queue, resulting in me going on a 14 game loss streak and deranking as far as Bronze 2. 

It has been a week now, and yesterday I played the first match I won, in a Bronze - Iron lobby. It was a good day. Every single enemy dropped to their knees and started spraying at me the second they saw them, but I was untouchable and continued to one tap them. At 12-9, the enemy team decided to all buy Odins, which I dont have the skill to counter yet, and the match went to overtime. At 13-13, their Reyna went AFK. Unlucky for them, reported the Reyna, ez win for me though.

TLDR: I think it'll greatly help my fellow Bronze players to get to Silver soon if you unbind your crouch and learn to strafe shoot.

For me I know like 3 kinds of Valorant players: The one which is rlly nice and talks and jokes with you, then the toxic people and then the people who dont talk. But one time was a bit different.

It was like in June where I just streamed and played Unrated games with randoms. There I had like these 3 people and we had really much fun and joked around and everything and I actually didnt play too bad.

Then they invited me to their party and we played more, mainly custom deathmatch and they invited me to their discord. Then, a few days later, we played again and it was so much fun.

Fast forward to the summer holidays, I could only sit around due to a surgery. They kept me company all the time and we played Valorant, Minecraft, whatever we felt like. At this point we talked to each other like every day.

Fast forward to today, winter holidays, we couldnt talk much in between the 2 holidays due to not having time but now we talk again every day for the most time.

I just wanna say thank you Valorant for making me queue up with these amazing people because else I wouldnt have found them. We have plans of meeting up IRL one day and I really hope it happens.

With that being said, thanks for reading my little story. Did you ever have an experience like that?

Remove the upgrade and ult orbs. That's it


Riot has nerfed spike rush Chamber's headhunter, because they ""still want this mode to be an opportunity to see what happens when everyone has the same guns""

That alone should've ticked them off.

It's neither fun nor fair when you're running around with judges and someone shoots you with an operator. Or the round just started and your team gets annihilated by Jett's or Raze's Ult.

Imo, the ults themselves should be removed for spike rush, but I understand that this might not be good.


All in all, spike rush has the potential to be a trully fun warm-up or ""I still have one objective to do"" mode.
But the way it is now, I for example, only use it to test my internet connection and I doubt thats the intent.

VALORANT,2022,1,"Hi there, fellow gamers. I'll preface the post by saying that, I don't know any better than anyone. I do believe that you can achieve great results in aim and rank, regardless of if your sensitivity conforms to the ""norm"" - as long as it's something you feel comfortable with.

I don't actively play any shooter to pursue the highest rank since I'm unfortunately busy with University.

However, I  ONCE DID! - I played CS:GO until valve fucked that game.

By this I mean; circa right around the rank redistribution of 2017, where I fell from high LEM/low supreme to LE, whereafter I only played casually.  I've amassed a mere 1700 hours, so when playing games, I try to play my best, even though I call myself a ""casual"" I do tryhard and sweat the shit out of my games. Old habits die hard..

In valorant, I got placed at gold 1 in act 3 without knowing what any of the agents did. Not great IMO (not trying to diss anyone), but with only 14 hours and 24 ranked games, I think it's okay...

BUT! I've just begun playing apex legends again, and when I tried to convert my sensitivity, I figured that I should check if that 4 y/o sensitivity still was the best (1.159 @ 800dpi in csgo).

When I began playing valorant around late October, I quickly ran through the 360 degrees method, while taking into account Tenz's guide on how to find a good sens. I once again found it was around 0.37 which my CS:GO sensitivity also roughly converts to (0,364). However, I didn't JUST want to narrow it down by feel again or to convert my exact sensitivity - I wanted to see what made me play the best! Since I quite quickly can adapt to a sensitivity and perform alright. Could I somehow measure and assess my performance with each sens?

So I started testing; I downloaded Aimlabs and ran through a playlist of four training tasks to measure the performance of each sensitivity. I did this by running through the playlist at each sensitivity, 0.37, 0.44, and 0.56. Corresponding to my sensitivity, Tenz and Shrouds sensitivity, and Aceu's apex legends sensitivity, since that was the game I was planning to play.

After doing this once, I realized that my score might actually just be getting better because I was warming up and learning the exercise, and not because I was using a higher/better sensitivity. So then I ran the test again, but this time playing two rounds of spidershot at one sensitivity, then two rounds of that on the next, and lastly two rounds on the third, and afterward the next task is in the same order. Then I added the results together and took the average of both the rounds, to see what sens technically worked best.

https://preview.redd.it/oe44rvmwbo981.png?width=1266&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=08eeba48a235b70e6055bf9f30a2b960a1e13ccf

And as you can see, Shroud and Tenz might actually be on to something. I do have to mention though, that taking more tests would give a more accurate average, but I don't have the time for that xD.  You could even take averages of your advanced feedback, to see averages of TTK, Error size, and precision, and factor these into your decision.

In some tests, there were outlier-scores where I got an insane score right after bombing the same test with the same sensitivity, for example getting 69.472 and 93.204 in tracking with 0.37 back to back. All these results are fine in my opinion. I somehow managed to make it to supreme with my old sensitivity, so it's just about finding what is comfortable for you. Got to emerald IV on Aimlabs with two hours of gameplay, so I guess I've still got some skill. Maybe.

Most people recommend going with be an eDPI around 250-500 for aim valorant, which I agree with. I think higher eDPI's make sense for valorant since there's quite a lot of moving vertically and horizontally, compared to something like cs:go, and I'm not a fan of lower sensitivities because I play as entry fragger or aggressive awper in cs - but to each their own.

VALORANT,2022,1,"I'm sure many people have already suggested this, but I'm going to go forward to push it again. I seriously think there are a few issues with DM in Valorant, and many agree with my opinions. For example:

&amp;#x200B;

* Capped Games
   * Capped Games make for a place where people will sit, and watch specific spawns, etc, and do some quite annoying things just to get a ""win"" in a game mode that doesn't provide them anything. With 1v1 aim maps like CSGO had (as seen below), there would be a better reason to be a ""winner"" in these.

&amp;#x200B;

* Unrealistic Fights
   * This is a personal gripe, but I feel as if most of the time I'm getting shot in the back during DMs. Maybe it's map size and player count, but when I play my Radiant/IM3 competitive games, there are very few times where I'm consistently getting shot in the back. So this makes warming up feel a lot less realistic, which sucks. 1v1s would solve this. It also makes for an exciting ladder climb against the best players, and allowing those to 1v1 against players that have the same skill in the lobby. This gives incentive to improve so they can climb the 1v1 ladder in that match to play against better players.

&amp;#x200B;

* Soundwhoring
   * I play my DMs with music on, audio at 20% or less. Typically I can't even hear the game when playing. Though I've noticed a lot of players will just hold angles and simply listen for players to come their way. I'm not exactly sure what is rewarding for this kind of gameplay, but it just makes for a very lackluster warmup.

&amp;#x200B;

If you don't know how CS's 1v1 servers worked, here's a short explanation:

All players began at 0 frags, 0 deaths. Each player is put into a map as seen below, in 16 small sections of a map (some premade from maps, some nothing like competitive pooled maps). You have 45 seconds to fight the other player, you peek, take shots, etc. Do what you must to win your round so you can advance. The more 1v1's you win, the higher up the board you move, meaning you play against better players who are also winning their 1v1's. There are also server rulesets where players can allow awp/op rounds, pistol rounds, etc, so players can 1v1 against eachother in more ways than one. It's a very good way to warm up. I'm surprised that Valorant doesn't have that in place of DMs.

&amp;#x200B;

Another short idea is that the game could be 15 minutes long, meaning 900 seconds, giving up to 20 rounds of 1v1's before it cycles players into new lobbies (or just continues).

&amp;#x200B;

In the near future here, I'll also be creating some small cut sections of maps to show 3D renders of what 1v1's could look like in Valorant.

VALORANT,2022,1,"All of us here come from unique gaming backgrounds and have seen different rates and significance of patches. For example, I came here from League of Legends, so a two-week patch cycle with consistent changes is nothing new to me. While the patches for this game feel less drastic than League, I don't necessarily believe there's anything wrong with that. I'm especially curious about the focus on ""agent balance"" for the next few months and what it'll mean for the meta. 

I'm also interested in the perspective of players from other games too. CSGO players might feel refreshed by how frequent the updates are, while Overwatch players might fear that eventually VALORANT will have far too many agents if they keep adding them at this rate. I never played R6 so I can't predict what those players are going to say lol. 

Anyway, what are your thoughts on the updates so far?

VALORANT,2022,1,"Playing comp is something I’d really like to do. I find I perform well in unrated games, I ofc have my bad games but I’m somewhat consistently “ok” and I’d like to obviously get a rank and see where Im playing at.

However.

Im a girl, and that doesn’t go well with a lot of people on valorant. Even in unrated games I get assholes screaming the whole game simply because I gave a comm. This happens quite often to me, I know it’s only a small portion of players that are like this but I have horrible luck.

I very much value comms. I do, I enjoy giving them if I’m not performing my best and I find receiving them helps win rounds a lot. The issue is, dickheads.

You can argue that I can “just mute them”, but it doesn’t take away from the fact it makes me tilted, will ruin my mood for the whole game, and make me miss out on comms those players may make (they can also team kill me, body block, etc.)

So what can I truly do? I want to play comp but I’m afraid of the people I meet there being, assholes really. In unrated it’s easier as it doesn’t exactly matter if we lose, it’s just for fun, so there’s no worry or pressure from muting. But comp matters. What can I do?",2022-01-04 16:09:28

I see that the MVPs are always those with the most kills, or at least many kills. I am mainly playing viper and I have watched many guides and lineups so I believe for a start It's quite ok. But I feel like as Viper I should stay relatively passive, plant the spike and try to defend it as long as possible, which does not seem to grand a lot of kills. Is this just the wrong playstyle, should I be more aggressive to get more kills and therefore more RR or is it really the case that I should play passive but then do not get rewarded for that at all? 
Or to ask more generally, how should I play Viper to be impactful, yet not headless, and still get an appropriate amount of RR to rank up?",2022-01-04 16:40:25

VALORANT,2022,1,"Hey guys I'm relatively new to the game and i don't really don't understand why you would buy skins that are so expensive. 

I played a lot csgo and there you were able to at least sell the skin you paid 50 euros for but in valorant isnt such an option. I mean these skins are even more expensive than in apex legends and even there the skins where so overpriced that it makes just no sense to me. 

In League of legends there are just like 4 skins that cost more than 20 euros and you are able to unlock every skin by pure luck and don't have to invest anything at the end of the day. Don't get me wrong I really like nearly all of their skins but, I think at this point valorant has one of the most absourd price for ingame purchases.

You can't even refinance your Battlepass like in other games. So I would like to ask why you bought yourself a skin and why you were ready to pay 50 euros for a gun skin that you can't even sell or get any other benefit(which would be broken and should not be implemented).

I would love a system like League of legends has where you can get skins out of chest which you can gain by playing or something similar",2022-01-04 17:39:33
VALORANT,2022,1,"Can't sleep, posting these with a view that she will be an initiator to rival sova and counter jett

Slide/dash
Devs said she ""slides into the action"", this will be a very similar ability to Jetts dash, but the animation will be sliding along the ground

Lighting strike
One of her voice lines is ""I hope they get struck by lightning"", as an initiator, she can call down a lightning strike on the map with a range of approx sovas recon arrow that will slow anyone standing on the ground within its range, after charging for half a second, so could be destroyed. This is the direct counter to Jett, as it could slow her dash away.

Energy ball
Again, as an info initiator, she can throw a ball of energy that will stick to any surface and then zap any enemy within line of site and outline their position. Similar to sova recon

Ultimate
Her voice line ""I go fast"" could lead to an ult with a sustained increase in movement speed. I would say that riot would be wary of these abilities, as consistent player movement is important to high level play, holding angles for swings etc, but as an ultimate it might be acceptable. If she gave off some electrical spray too, to give away her position slightly but also some chip damage to any enemies close enough it might be interesting

VALORANT,2022,1,"Give me Info! that is your ONLY job when dead. I 100% believe I can clutch most situations if I know who is where and what I am up against.. It's actually the strongest aspect of my Valorant game, doing a 1vX. The amount of Clutches I have done with Astra/Sova and even raze is absurd and that isn't even counting Reyna. This is no way meant to brag but I am quite a reliable player. I am no flashy fragging I just do the little things right and can be relied on in any situation. From an Imm Lobby this is still happening. In fact, its either Worse some days or perfect.. No in between 

Nothing tilts me more is when someone starts to coach When I am in a 1V1, 1V2, 1V3 ETC lemme do my thing. Like I said, this is the best part of my game even if you don't know that. The best thing for you to do is just shut up, give me the info you have and let me try and get it done. I want to win just as much as you do and you telling me to play your way when your way got you killed that round just doesn't make sense. It's the unwritten rule of CSGO/Valorant. 

If I mess up laugh at me, Tell me what I did wrong, Suggest a better strat maybe. But sitting here and telling me what to do step by step in the middle of my play will 100% get you muted every game. I let it slide once, or twice. I want to work with you not against you but if your back seat gaming constantly I have 0 issues muting you. 

but as the title says, Even if your ""call"" is correct I most likely already been planning on using it. I know a correct play from a wrong one. so telling me ""you have knives"" or Ult or whatever util i have left I forced to rethink my entire Strat that I have created for myself and throws the entire play out of wack. the second I am in a post plant situation for some reason people like to coach... Well when you died and I am last alive my brain is already rehearsing what I am going to do. Not only that... The amount of times I heard someone suggest something and it gets that player killed is hilarious.

Just... Be quiet. Tell me where they were last or what they do previously and your job is done. There is no reason to coach unless I ask a question. Specially if I have proven myself prior rounds or games.",2022-01-04 18:26:40

VALORANT,2022,1,"Hi everyone and thanks to every person who spend their valuable time reading this post. I made it because well, I have the question above that I want to ask for ideas and opinions. Started playing competitive games since January 4th of 2021 and my first game was actually csgo( got the specific date I started cause of steam and my faceit account). I got interested in valorant through a friend and started playing since the end of ep3-act 1. I used to play with a few of my friends and got plat 3 in my first act. After that, school started to get more busy and even tho the lack of time, I still tried my best to play. Solo queued all of act 2 and i got diamond 2 and now im currently in diamond 3. 

As said above, I really want to become a professional athlete in esport. I am currently 16 and turning 17 this September. I usually have around 4-8 hours weekdays and 8-10 hours weekends  to grind. I wished I started competitive games earlier so that I have more time to train and improve on crucial parts of my raw mechanics and gameplay. I did my best to make up for that by watching vods of pro matches alot, aim trainers every single day and try to write down one thing to improve on every day so that I can become better. 

So, how you guys think? I know becoming a pro is a hard journey and its gonna take a lot of dedication to make it to the big stages. That's why I really really want to go on this path. I also did backup plans so that I can be more sure and confident on taking this road. Thank you for reading!

p/s: I don't have any team or stacks to play with now and I am doing this all alone so if you have any more tips for solo players to seek out chances and opportunities then pls also leave a comment. Appreciate you alot!",2022-01-04 18:43:21

And this what happens to me since csgo.

VALORANT,2022,1,Tarik Smurfs On Radiants Insane Pistol Round,2022-01-05 01:36:29
VALORANT,2022,1,"I play with a group of friends all the time and we're loving the game.

Our ranks are currently:

- Silver 3

- Silver 1

- Bronze 2

- Bronze 1

- Bronze 1

It's obvious that the silvers in our group are better to some extent, but the rest of us are certainly getting there. We work pretty well as a team and we tend to all end up with similar kill amounts by the end. The lowest scorer is a different one of us every game and they very rarely go into single digits unless we're getting stomped by smurfs.

At our current ranks, a couple wins will push the silver 3 into gold and then we ALL get only 50% RR for games. Given that rank points seem to be mostly based on win/loss rather than individual performance, doesn't this mean that the gap between our ranks will never get any smaller, even if us stragglers are closing the gap in terms of skill and game performance?

Being paired against smurfs isn't fun, and I don't want to contribute to that if our best player has to make a smurf account to stop the rest of us from getting stuck at our current ranks.

Is this gap in ranks likely to get way smaller at the beginning of the next act if our individual performance is truly as close as I suggest, or will the current ranks stop us moving somehow? Not too sure how that works. Have I misunderstood anything here?

Seems weird to me that everyone's RR points get halved. I get the logic of halving it to avoid the lower ranks getting carried, but if a bronze 1 properly pulls out all the stops and does much better than expected against silvers, for example, is it really fair to significantly limit their RR points because they have a higher rank player on their team? Seems like there is a grey area here.",2022-01-05 01:38:24

Someone had this cool idea of Riot adding a ""throwback thursday"" where once a month, on a random thursday during the month, the store would have a random past Skin Bundle featured. For 24 hours you could buy it. People agreed it would get more people playing the game (especially on thursdays). This would probably get more people buying Valorant Points, and definitely get more older players (as in players who started a while ago, e.g. 2020) to play again for the chance of finding their favourite old bundles.

The biggest offender of this is people planting open on split on B. I cringe so hard when people look to the left instead of right(which is the direction of garage). They go to main or garage and they can't see the spike. If they had planted at the edge of the open and looked extreme right they would have a clear view of the spike and ezpz clutch.

Remember guys always look towards the direction you think is gonna give you maximum vision on the spike.

VALORANT,2022,1,"So, I've recently started to play a few games of DM to warm up before hopping into ranked and I'm already seeing genuine improvement to my gunplay. Unfortunately that improvement seems to be restricted entirely to DM. 
So for example my headshot rate in ladder games is abyssmal but whenever I'm in DM (especially by the second game) I manage to semi-consistently kill people via headshot. But the moment I start a ranked game it feels like I'm exactly as terrible at gunplay as I was previously. 
I get that everyone's gunplay is a bit better in DM since you dont have to focus on your skills or map movements and all that stuff, but it seems like with me the contrast ist just very stark. 
Any tips on how to properly implement the things I improve on in DM into my regular games?",2022-01-05 14:07:09

I know my sens is good i can flick directly onto heads in the range but when it comes to in game my head just wonders. Crosshair placement is second nature by now and i never forget it but i end up loosing my gunfights cause i can’t seem to focus when the time comes. Anyone else experience this?

VALORANT,2022,1,"While playing around with Viper in a custom game, I found out that you can actually use part of her wall as a One Way. To create such a wall, you have to find an elevated object like a box that is about a quarter of the height of the player, you try to create an overhang with the wall, so there is a gap under the wall which you use for your one way. The viper wall is divided into multiple segments and the overhang can be as long as one segment but not longer, so you try to get away as far as possible from the elevated object without creating a new wall segment and then you look in the direction of the object and put up your Viper wall, it does not matter in which degree you look up in the sky as long as you don't look at the ground when putting up your wall. I found two spots that are actually usefull because you still have a default wall and the benefit of the One Way. The first spot is the Zombs wall on Breeze as defender where you cross the site through Tunnel into Mid on B, you can use the bricks at Backsite to create an overhang there. The other spot is in hookah on Bind, there is this box on the right when you enter hookah as an attacker, there you can set up your wall and make it cross to A short, so you get additional value out of your wall. Let me know if you can find some other useful spots, maybe even as an Attacker.

TLDR: I made a video showing the walls, because it is hard to explain how it works: [https://youtu.be/yxhxl5fapxc](https://youtu.be/yxhxl5fapxc)",2022-01-05 14:59:53

Every day I log on to check the store for a gun I won't fully upgrade, just so I can tilt the enemy team after they kill me and find there is no kill banner on their newly Reaver Vandal. I play with a variety of players from iron to radiant because I don't filter who I play with through some arbitrary ladder system Rito designed that only reward kills. I'm more inclusive than that. When I'm dominating a game, I don't continue to stomp my poor opponents, I type ""Knife Mid.""

If I'm bronze I totally deserve the iron buddy aswell or if I'm radiant then I deserve all buddies because we always talk about climbing the ranked ladder. So if I passed all the steps on the ladder why do I only get recognition for the one I am currently standing on?

I like equipping a gun buddy that fits to the color of my skin and in most cases the act buddy will not fit. Granting the player a buddy of a rank that he or she has already passed feels like a no brainer to me and would only benefit. There are even some players that smurf to iron to get the buddy and then climb all the way up to flex with a iron buddy in immortal or higher.",2022-01-05 17:31:43

C - Tunnel Vision. A double wall for entry. Potentially could do shock damage. The enemy reveal was definitely just a Sova dart.

Q - Energy Ball. A ball like Yoru’s that slams to the ground when it hits a surface and concusses enemies. Not a flash. 

E - Energy Burst. Let’s Neon sprint and slide for a period of time. Maybe stim?

VALORANT,2022,1,"Hello Valorantcommunity

I have played Valorant since release and struggle to rank (hardstuck silver3) up even tough i can read what the enemies are doing. I always die due to being outnumbered everytime and die as an entry fragger without success. How am i supposed to hold flank on attack if everyone of my team dies on site with the spike. Or i am playing on defender and want to watch out for enemies on flank and  and then getting outnumbered again. My aim also hasn´t improved i dont´t know why. I don´t know why I don´t improve so much. There must be something I do wrong or perhaps others. Just because I suck doesn´t mean i I will give up. I don´t take every gunfight i cannot win but how am i supposed to win if i then getting killed on flank again. My team gets killed because of that. I play every agent because i am getting bored very easily with one. My edpi is 250. And lower higher is not good. I know what sensivity feels right and wrong . I play also on 60 hz refresh rate.

Example:

For example I play reyna on Ascent. I pick out of garage and flash sometimes out for informations or kills. But I have to give up garage or mid because  the enemies rush in. After that I try to retake but still most of the time  I am losing. Someone always comes from flank, but how does that help if your team dies lmao. If kill one on flank everyones know I am here and I am getting killed. No one really watches flank so I am always doing the job to defend from intruders. The only experience i get is you die and everyone else is dead or everyone else dies and you are the last player. 

I always relied on my Team  until 2 Months ago. And after that nothing really changed. Alone you are no match for someone with better aim or better oppurtunities. I did everything I tried everything yet I fail. I don´t play sentinels. How everyone plays is so flawed yet it works. I don´t want to rely on a team that can´t be relied on. Even if i manage to do that everything is too late. But I am unable to do so. I read so many posts about this topic and tried many things but i would be thankful if there is something that can be done bette or improved. Nothing seems working. But i don´t believe in that.

A wee while back I made [**a post about the state of the servers**](https://www.reddit.com/r/VALORANT/comments/rqcuqm/desync_peekers_advantage/) and how the game has felt off for the past months. As I just got back to streaming, this was one of the first matches I had on my new rig.

Have a look, and feel free to set the video to 0.25x (only needed from 9 seconds and after, so you don't waste your time) - I know this is only a short clip with 1 death of millions in the game, so I'm not gonna kickflip the entire mood over it, but it's just such a \_fantastic\_ way to show a prime example of what I ment in that post. This is the constant feeling of being on a pre-set handicap timer where you're constantly being updated last by the server.

**A few things to note which is highly relevant**  
\- Right before I get served a hot 5x56 caliber bullet straight to the dome (I have this conception that the Vandal is 7x62 and Phantom is 5x56, just a weird irrelevant note) you can see that I take a step to the right, then quickly back to the left. Jiggle, peekers advantage etc.) - But at no time was I ever so far out that the Raze could get a clean headshot. A wallbang through the corner of Sage's wall? Absolutely likely. A direct hit to the face? Uuuuh..... o.O

**//** Although all stats (fps, ping etc.) were disabled at this point, my FPS is locked to 165 which I get without any drops/dips

**//** For the extra spicey ones out there; I enabled graph for FPS, Ping and Packet Loss abit later in that match. All of these are flawless without as much as a fart.
