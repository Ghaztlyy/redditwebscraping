Miniseries: A Plague's Tale, Hollow Knight, Soma

Big fan of Horizon Zero Dawn's worldbuilding and setting, think this would be amazing with a big budget and good writers.

A Plague's Tale could do well as a miniseries. 6-8 episodes should be enough to have an intense experience without overstaying its welcome.

I've always wanted Hollow Knight to be a miniseries as well. Not an adapted Saturday morning cartoon, just a neat 5-7 episode show that doesn't have any dialogue, and you have to figure out the story just based on character actions and interactions.

After speaking with tons of different customer service people the best they can do is send me another copy after 7-10 business days. 

One customer service person even told me they had to receive the empty case back from me before they would start doing anything.

Before I even spoke to customer service I walked into my local Gamespot and the assistant manager was on the line with customer service because his own $350 order was missing lol. Legit -- I know that sounds nuts.

The only reason I ordered from them was because of the buy 2 get 2 free deal they had on used games!

Side complaint-- one of the games has a status of ""Awaiting product availability"" which means they let me buy a used game they don't even have in stock(!?)

Side complaint 2-- the first customer service person kept saying she couldn't hear me. I could hear loud music playing in the background, so I suggested she turn it down. I was put on hold for 5 minutes and when she came back the music was gone.

gaming,2020,1,"Summary: In this game, your avatar join the Resistance against Doctor Eggman's army, which consists of Infinite, Shadow, Chaos, Zavok and Metal Sonic, as well as normal robots. In a part of the game, you find out that every major member in Eggman's army are nothing more than replicas (except Infinite). Eventually, the heroes win against the army, and restores peace.


Opinion: Although the game has an interesting story, it lacks good controls of the characters (especially Classic Sonic), and also is incredibly short. The ""normal"" difficulty seems the easiest thing ever, as of the ""hard"" difficulty, which is the reccomended one. There's only one enemy Badnik in 80% of the game. Creating and customizing your avatar is the strongest point of this game. It's not the worst Sonic game that exists, but it's clearly not the best.

So i bought the original ps4 about 4-5 years ago with GtaV and I've been playing non stop since then. I have 3.5k hours and I basically love the game. I also play rd2 and a couple of cod games.

About 6 months ago it started revealing a couple of problems such as being extremely loud and the place where you put the disks makes weird noises when theres not even a disk inside...

I'm really worried its gonna ""die"" on me before the ps5 comes out or a bit after and I'll have to buy another one and the ps5...I know that even if it survives for another year or 2 I'll still be playing the games I mentioned and I'm not sure if buying another ps4 and a ps5 will be a good idea or a total waste of money.

gaming,2020,1,"Hey everyone,

This is a proposal to all the companies out there renewing AAA titles every year. I'm talking about the annual sports games like FIFA, NBA, WWE and more.

Why don't you guys develop your games with a gap for at least 2 years? This would make space for creativity,passion and better games in the market. Making these games every year hurts the company's reputation and is considered as a complete waste of money for the player. Throughout the decade renewing titles are losing their values and their worth to their players and are just becoming a way for the companies to keep their revenue in check.

So I want like to ask the companies to keep a gap of at least a year to make better and amazing games. But what does it mean.....

To the player:

The player gets better content and better gameplay with beautiful storylines. The player also gets to make better use of their money as they would be investing for a game which would be supported for a longer period of time. Companies like could add new seasons to their games in order to keep the content fresh like PES and FIFA does for their mobile titles. 

To the Indie developers,

Doing this also helps the massive amount of indie developers out there. As people would not get much time consuming games to play like, they would switch to look at Indie games and see how they play out, thus creating opportunities for the finding of beautiful titles. In the past few years, Indie games are getting better with a lot of originality and beautiful storytelling. It is an amazing ride which is made by a group of people with all their passion. Some of the examples in the past are Disco Elysium, Celeste, Ape Out, Journey, Inside and much, MUCH MORE.

To the companies:

This would take the huge pressure off the company's shoulder of pushing out titles every year and give out better content to offer and look for better ratings in their games. Crunch times would be reduced and actual passion can be put in the game. 
A great example I would like to talk about is Ubisoft. Their Assassin's Creed title took off when they introduced AC2 to the market which was released on 2009. Following that, they released their follow up titles Brotherhood, Revelations and AC3. These games suffered a bit of criticism in terms of their content by not living up to AC2. However AC4 brought it back, but still there was a lack of polish. But later on, Ubisoft decided to space their games by giving the games to its subsidiaries like Montreal and Quebec. This led to better titles in the series like Origins and the GOTY nominee Odyssey.

As you can see, titles succeed better by spacing their release dates better. 2019 was a wreck with games like WWE, NBA, etc with unpolished designs.

So this a plea to the gaming companies out their to give a gap of at least a year to make better games. 2020 can be considered as a mercy year for the companies to release their worked on titles, but from 2021, kindly don't push yourselves. 

Let's start this new decade with a bit of change and a bit of positivity to all the upcoming games.
So please share this message. #Gap2Game

Sincerely,
The Gaming Community",1577851752

gaming,2020,1,"10. Space Engineers
- On the surface, this voxel-based space sandbox is a sci-fi Minecraft ripoff, but with the advent of in-house mod support through the Steam Workshop, as well as constant updates from the developers, Space Engineers has skyrocketed to a household name for fans of creative gameplay (pun intended). Personally, this game fulfills my childhood desire to build colossal LEGO space ships and crash them into each other at high speeds. Mixed with ‚Äúrealistic‚Äù survival obstacles such as power, oxygen, gravity, and...space spiders, Space Engineers brings hours of fun to the table, whether you play Survival or Creative modes, with friends or solo.

9. Battlefield 1
- As the first mainstream Battlefield game since Battlefield 4, this World War 1 shooter sure makes a splash. Despite the recent controversy concerning EA and their in-game purchase habits, BF1 manages to remain pretty detached from it all. While certain weapons can only be obtained via opening chests, they are far from mandatory to enjoy the game (and getting chests just for playing isn‚Äôt too rare). Battlefield 1 gives you what is fun in a generic war game, such as flying a fighter plane or driving through a building with a landship while remaining true to the harsh reality that was the Great War. With the wide variety of maps, weapons, and vehicles, Battlefield 1 has enough content to hook First-Person Shooter fans for countless hours.

8. MGSV: The Phantom Pain
- Woe to the forsaken child of Hideo Kojima. A stellar game marred only by behind-the-scenes drama, Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain remains one of the greatest experiences of the decade. The game offers a multitude of methods for completing your objectives, and it is usually the player‚Äôs choice if they want to dispatch their enemies with a silenced bullet, a tranquilizer dart, or a balloon that technically kidnaps them, but its okay because you‚Äôre the good guys! Despite being the fifth installment in a tumultuous series, no prior knowledge is needed to understand the story, although there will certainly be some details that go over a new player‚Äôs head. All in all, MGSV ranks highly for the sheer diversity in gameplay it offers.

7. Assassin‚Äôs Creed IV: Black Flag
- Although it remains an Assassin‚Äôs Creed game at heart, I consider this to be the penultimate pirate experience in a video game. Nothing beats the thrills of the ship-to-ship combat, especially against the tougher enemies. For fans returning to the series, there is plenty to do on land as well, such as  chasing targets over rooftops in a beachside port town or stealthily clearing out fortress guards. Fans of ‚Äòpiratology‚Äô will also enjoy the references to and appearances of classic historical figures who ravaged the Caribbean coastline in the 17th and 18th centuries.

6. Sid Meyer‚Äôs Civilization V
- Civ V is the game I have uninstalled and reinstalled the most. I will play a match for hours on end, then not touch it for a month and uninstall it, only to want to play another game in a few weeks. With a huge roster of unique countries to play as and an excellent map generation system, Civ V offers unlimited potential as a turn-based strategy game. Personally, I will always prefer the ‚Äòmore realistic‚Äô style of this fifth installation compared to the cartoony graphics of its successor, as well as the majority of its rules and gameplay assets, which make it very easy for new players to get hooked. Excellent to play with friends or against the A.I.

5. Super Mario Odyssey
- Super Mario Odyssey serves as a breath of fresh air for the franchise. Without a mainstream 3D title since Super Mario Galaxy 2 in 2010, Nintendo fans were craving the semi-open world feeling that was first given to us with Super Mario 64. Offering silly fun for the family as well as more challenging goals for the ‚Äúhardcore‚Äù gamer, Odyssey has something for everyone. The locations are colorful, the characters are fun, and the darn Luncheon Kingdom makes me hungry every time.

4. The Legend of Zelda: BotW
- The first Zelda game I ever played was the Ocarina of Time redux for the 3DS, so I can‚Äôt say that I‚Äôve been a lifelong fan of the series, but I will be forever onward thanks to Breath of the Wild. BotW is a masterpiece of art work and gameplay that shocks and awes at every turn. The game has scattered references to earlier titles as well as a host of new ideas, characters, and locations, and you will never run out of ruins to explore, monsters to fight, or puzzles to solve. 

3. Destiny 2
- Destiny 2 is the prodigal son of modern gaming. After the general disappointment that was the original Destiny, and the tumultuous ‚ÄúAge of Activision‚Äù at the sequel‚Äôs beginning, Bungie finally has free reign of their breakthrough franchise. Perfectly blending fast-paced shooter combat with intricate raid/strike/dungeon mechanics all set in a captivating sci-fi universe, Destiny 2 brings to the table fun like no other title can. It is an utterly unique experience in the best ways possible. Even for Day 1 players, the game stays fresh with the constant content updates. A new season every 3 months, weekly resets, and holiday events provide endless hours of entertainment. 

2. Dark Souls III
- As the final installment in a stellar trilogy, DS3 delivers an intriguing story with memorable characters and then punishes you with its brutal combat just for stopping to smell the flowers. Regardless of your past experience with the infamous difficulty of many From Software games, you will face new challenges the whole way through this game and its two nostalgia-trip DLCs. 25 unique bosses offer flawless fights and despite dying countless times, it always feels worth it the first time you beat them. Countless weapons, spells, and armor new and old give this game a massive replayability value that is unrivaled by other ARPGs. It is too easy to sink dozens of hours into a character.

1. The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim
- Where to start with Skyrim. On a personal level, Skyrim will always be my favorite game of all time because it is the first game I ever owned on Steam. I actually bought the disc and all it did was install steam and activate a key! But i digress. Skyrim will go down in history as a colossal feat of software engineering from a technical perspective, to a study of its art, to the infinite ripples in social media/meme culture that it caused. Of course, it isn‚Äôt flawless, especially by today‚Äôs standards, but it is my top game of the 2010s and will likely be on ‚ÄúBest Games of the Century‚Äù lists in 80 years. A talented, albeit small voice cast, engaging gameplay, and a high replayability value (especially with the introduction of the Switch port and VR edition) all add to the great fun that this game presents on a silver platter which you can sell to a merchant for 2 gold.",1577852588

gaming,2020,1,"3rd person melee combat with magic and enchantments to weapons and abilities. An example of an ability is something like the more you bit your enemy the stronger your weapon gets or your weapon scales with your skill points there will be tons of diversity. 

Weapons and what they do: Standard Sword, Dagger, shield, axe, spear, and katana bow is a weapon but isn‚Äôt traditional. 

Key bindings: 

light and heavy attack can differ depending on the weapon and other things but usually it means that light attacks don‚Äôt stagger enemies but instead make fast less damaging attacks to lower enemies health. Heavy attacks take longer probably double the amount of time and do more damage but are high risk. Successful it‚Äôs with heavy attacks stagger your enemy and cancel out there attacks. 

Deflect this blocks standard attacks easily blocking stuff like light dagger attacks. The heavier attacks require specific timing to block them. When you deflect you have about 1 second to parry an enemy after that it‚Äôs just a standard block. Some weapons like the axe or spear can damage your weapon and you if you choose to hold down the deflect button. Deflecting shouldn‚Äôt be over used there are mutiple ways to counter enemies attacks...

Dodging. Not like dark souls dodging the dodges are REALISTIC. They are short and made for well... short dodges and dodging enemy damage. Dodging in the direction of an enemy attack will put you in a situation where you can attack them but have to be fast. They are made for when you are out of time or range to deflect so you dodge into attacks to avoid them. 
Jumping may also be useful. This is for attacks that try to go for your feet. 

Overall the combat system is very complex and has a high skill curve. There will be different techniques in combat and you never know what your opponent may do. You have to take the time to practice and master all techniques to excel in the combat. That‚Äôs just pvp",1577862069

Today I saw the game called [Hero Wars](https://hero-wars.com/),  I like the view of the game and the whole side scroller like battle  system with building a team and upgrading it, pretty much the whole  thing. I did however not like the limited play/pay-to-play thing.

This  is where I need you guys help, I'm looking for a real game that is  similar to Hero Wars, but is a either free, or pay once, I'd prefer it  on steam or similar store platform, but it is not really a requirement.

I hope you guys got some suggestions :)

For me, the best experience was probably Sekiro on PS4 and Heat Signature the PC. Both really great games in very different ways.

The biggest disappointment was Fallout 76, what a shit show.

In 2020, I'm excited but also nervous about Final Fantasy VII Remake. I really want it to be amazing and everything the fans want and more. The trailers have looked stunning. But... I'm still reluctant to pre-order in case they screw it up by adding microtransactions or online elements that impact the single player RPG I loved as a kid.",1577875611

Now it wouldn't apply to everything, but I feel that the Elder Scrolls series would be a great concept and is popular enough to make an amazing museum. I'm just going to use ""Skyrim"" as an example but this could include anything from the other entries as well. Imagine walking through the front doors and seeing a giant replica of Alduin's wall. They could have a section on the different races that live in the region and a section on each of the Holds in the land. They would have a display of the shield and the guards armor and a little history of the town. They could have displays for each of the armor types and complete weapon sets, they could have a section with all of the Daedric Artifacts on display, another section on all of the shrines found in the land. They could have a realistic dungeon walk-thru or tour area populated with Draugr that you could explore with an easy route or a second more advanced puzzle route, both¬†leading to an end area with say a Dragon Priest and a Dragon Wall. Another area with information about the Thieves guild and then a section about the Dark Brotherhood, the College of Winterhold, and other displays set up based around enchanting and crafting and such. They could have food court area set up like taverns with a bard singing songs during certain times of the day. They could have a life size skeleton of a dragon, and of course a section with a replica of the Elder Scroll itself! I mean, there is so many things that they could do to make this such an epic idea!

gaming,2020,1,"Last night I was going to try Surviving Mars for the first time, but then I realized I hadn't downloaded it yet so I played some Kerbal Space Program instead. Then I thought it would be funny to play those back to back, like I built a rocket to Mars and now I have to colonize it. That got me thinking, how many games could you chain together in one ""timeline?"" Here's what I came up with.

Ancestors: Humankind Odyssey

Civilization (4, 5 or 6?)

Kerbal Space Program

Surviving Mars

Endless Space

What else can you add to this? Something between Ancestors and Civ, for sure. Or break Civ up into a bunch of games. What comes before Ancestors?",1577886341

I‚Äôm not actually sure wether it was fully stop motion, I just know that you would choose and place your characters at the location you chose and give the characters different commands (attack, run etc.) and make a movie out of the segments.

gaming,2020,1,"I just can't remember this one character and it's bugging me because I want to add her to my Sims 4 game, could anyone help me find at least which game she was in? It had to be either Sims 1 or Sims 2, I highly doubt it was Sims 3 but who know's maybe someone can surprise me.

The game had actual ""Dance Floors"", I do remember that one of the buildings you visit it had like a groove/ disco ball hanging above the dance floor and a DJ, etc. and life stages where if you meet a certain goal either in career or money or whatever you can advance to the next stage home till you reach your end game home, I remember that there was this ""spooky"" or Goth-like manor at one of the stages. Another house that you can progress towards had a more ""Artsy"" style to it.

Anyways, the one character I can't seem to find for some reason i could've sworn her name was either Missy or Misty, but I can't find her at all on the wikia, she becomes one of your room mates in one of the stages of homes you can progress towards, she has blonde hair, twin tails/ pigtails (whatever you want to call them), short black skirt and I can't remember exactly what her top was but it was like a see-through top with a black bra. She also had a male roommate too I believe.

Any help is appreciated. I just need her name so I know what to name her in my Sims 4 game.

Edit: It's solved by LoneHer0, the character I was looking for is Mimi Landgrabb.

gaming,2020,1,"So after hearing that the gameplay and such and such were improved. I decided to give the game a second chance due to the first time I played it, it was much worser than the first game( which was actually great imo). However, as I‚Äôm playing, I see it‚Äôs no better. 

First, Heroes vs Villains is complete TRASH! The villains are far more likely to win than the heroes due to their op abilities, or just a mastered Palpatine. The same guy who George Lucas wrote as a powerful Sith Lord, but not a fucking god. The guy is a world eater. Then there‚Äôs Mary Sue I mean Rey whose op Jedi mind trick that was never learned in the movies or used often can apparently go through the block. I also never knew that Jedi mind tricks could work on individuals with a much stronger mindset, let alone SITH!!!!!! And I hate the stamina, its stupid. The first battlefront was balanced. But in this game where in as a universe in which episode of Star Wars have you ever seen somebody get tired in a lightsaber fight?????

Then there‚Äôs half ass game modes with no galactic conquest. It seems like dice takes out more and more every sequel. I guess it‚Äôs too hard to make it like classic battlefront. The original battlefront eats this garbage alive. I‚Äôm comparing because that game was actually much funner. 

The story is blatantly predictable.

Overall, the game doesn‚Äôt feel better at all. Feels like the same game I left 3 years ago( Happy New Years) and I wasted money on it, again. I was deceived, we were all deceived by a lie.....",1577899204

Anyway, what I mean is that. Ive been wanting a game like Witcher but an FPS for a while now. But just in terms of its action mechanics. How you have to prep for each battle. Each creature in the world has a set of types, and the Witcher brings various potions with him to aid him in combat and exploit the weaknesses of those creatures. Whether it was stuff that boosted your abilities to deal damage to certain creatures, or made certain ones outright avoid you. It took a great deal of emphasis on making you plan your attack. Likewise, one of the best parts about Horizon Zero Dawn, was that you had to prep for each assault on one of the many creatures in the world. Piercing damage, Blunt damage, single shot but powerful, triple shots spread out, fire damage, electric damage. Creatures had their own resistances, and weaknesses and you had to exploit and plot out each one, and sometimes change your strategies on the spot and craft your arsenal as you went. Its one of the things that the 2 have in common that greatly add to the fun, is determining and hunting the creatures and figuring out their ins and outs. Even devising traps to better help you lay out the environment to better suit you in the midst of battle. While it could be argued that Monster Hunter is just the same, and Horizon Zero Dawn could be compared to that, and thats very much true. Im not comparing that to it because Horizon Zero Dawn and Witcher let you plan on the fly, while Monster Hunter is all about zeroing in on a single target and prepping before you even enter the area. They share some qualities like targeting specific weak points on creatures and breaking those to have a better chance at getting those materials (even though its still not guaranteed in MH like it is with HZD), but in the grand scheme I think it has a lot more in common, combat wise, with Witcher.

Still hoping for an FPS like Witcher game at some point though",1577901459

I've been looking for another good co-op game to play on pc but It seems I am either looking for the holy grail or in the wrong place...

The type of co-op we are looking for is 3rd or 1st person with a bit of a storyline and maybe some cutscenes. Games we really enjoyed were :   


Portal 2 

A way out

I tried styx shards of darkness but the CO-OP is worse than people were saying ... which is an impressive feat as people were really complaining. 

&amp;#x200B;

So I was hoping that you guys might have some ideas?

Edit:

A lot of reference to ""we were here"" and we did play that but I didn't know there was a sequel. So definitely know where I'm gonna start!! üôÇ

The story sucks for the same reasson people hated fallout 4, there is no real decision just dialogue branch/yes/no(yes)  and some endings.The caracters are forgetable. No one besides Keanu which perfomance as voice actor ended up being a dissapointment stands out.

There is no imersion, crime system sucks, cops telesport behind you, they can t ride cars, Citizens have 1 line of dialogue. Night city has nothing futuristic just sex Shops and food stands.

Stop defending this bad behaivor that CDPR showcased us with the treatament that this game received.

Stop pre-ordering games it will always end up bad.

Stop praising the writters of this company they never wrote and probably will never write a good story from 0.

Its time we stop giving our money for half assed backed games.

3-consoles are usually affordable and give you more gaming power for your money and the KFConsole is likely 2500+

gaming,2021,1,"I'm a librarian at an elementary school and I'm trying to market the library as a cool place for the kids to come and hang out. 

Now we're limited to just having them come as a class with their teachers and checking out books, but I'm thinking about starting something out when the pandemic is over (probably when school starts up in the fall).

The library has a bunch of board games and a deck of cards that are put away behind my desk because social distancing protocol outlawed them, but when this pandemic is over I thought about setting up tournaments for the kids to come and play competitively or watch their friends play and and get together.

Basically, I would do it like this. I would host a tournament over the course of 4 days (Monday through Thursday) with 2 matches per day (one during morning recess and wondering lunch recess). I'm not sure about whether I do this every week or every other week though.

Up to 8 players would be allowed to sign up for a tournament and the deadline would be the Friday before the week of the tournament.

The tournament would work by taking a board game or card game, simplifying the rules to make it finishable in 10-15 minutes (if necessary), and playing it in a single elimination format (as in if you lose once, you're out of the tournament). If you don't show up to a match, you forfeit.

I would start by cycling through all the games we have in stock week by week, and then once they've all been played I'll allow the players who sign up for a tournament to vote on which game they would like to play when they sign up. This way we can allow players to get a feel for all the games and decide which one they like to play the most.

What do you think, is there something that needs to be changed about this plan?",1609464730

1.7.3 (4757) software version of 4k Capture Utility and installed the most recent drivers on ElGato‚Äôs page for 4k60pro mk.2

Streaming system specs (workstation rig):

‚Ä¢Ryzen 9 3950x

‚Ä¢GTX 1660super

‚Ä¢MOBO: MSI MEG x570 Unify BIOS 7C35vA7

*Note all three m.2 slots are occupied by NVMe Gen4 drives

According to MOBO page itself, PCIe slots 3 and 5 should be able to support the 4k60pro mk.2 running x4

On gaming PC, ability to choose and clone the mk.2 as a display source is there.

On board explorer in BIOS the mk.2 isn‚Äôt recognized either whereas my other elgato products are, in BIOS it shows ‚Äúunknown vendor, unknown hardware, running x4‚Äù

I‚Äôve also tried to change PCIe lane three to run at Gen 3.0 and 2.0 to see if it would get picked up. Failed.

Windows version: 10.0.19042 build 19042

Tried reseating, re-installing etc. normal troubleshooting. Cannot get it to work, should I just return to BB and try a new one, or is there something I‚Äôm missing?

But we stopped playing pretty much right when that came out. I used Moze and he used Fl4k. He also has all 60 Amara but he had her before I joined in so our primary ones are Moze and Fl4k. We created new characters to play through together. I chose Zane and he chose Moze. 

We started discussing playing BL3 again so I was curious what's new in the last few months?

Any new weapons?

Any new missions?

What weapons got buffed and which ones got nerfed? 

Any new badass builds or meds?

I heard there was new trees? Does it make a huge difference? If so what exactly?

I tried reading the blogs and such but its hard to really tell what's new and going on since we left off. So if anyone could give a quick rundown or tell me what's most important and the biggest changes that would be awesome! Thank you!

I cross posted to BL3 subreddit but sometimes I get nothing from that SR lol.

So any advice on the best way to role play in 2077? Should I play V like a pre established character like I would Garelt? Any advice would be much appreciated! 

Also sorry for posting this on this sub it was the best I could think of given the fact that It wasn't allowed on the cyberpunk sub",1609481403

gaming,2021,1,"Okay, so I wanted to preface this saying that I own an Xbox 360s, a PS4 slim, and a PC with an i7-929, rx570 8gb, and 12gb of ram. I know and understand many peoples opinions saying that certain consoles or devices are better, but here are my opinions. Personally, I believe that buying last gen or even older gen consoles are 100% worth it. Yes, games will not be as good and graphic performance will be worse, but even games on the XBOX 360 still look good in my opinion. Also, the PS4 is an amazing console and it is easy to get a deal on it. The HDD is upgradeable to an SSD and it is a solid console even in 2020. Ultimately, besides exclusives, the XBOX and PS are very similar and whichever option you choose, you will be satisfied. Along with that, buying a last gen console will help you save money on games - games retail for 60-70 nowadays. For example, I bought 11 games for 40 on my Xbox 360. These titles include GTA IV, COD Ghosts, Destiny, assassins creed and more. However, both of these consoles are cheaper than buying a gaming ready pc. In my opinion, PC‚Äôs are well rounded devices ready to handle not only gaming, but also workspace and other tasks. The choice is yours ultimately, but to sum it up in my opinion: both consoles are great, and it is worth it especially if you are considering buying a last gen console. If you want something for gaming along with productivity, go for a PC. Have fun everybody, and happy New Years. Also, thank y‚Äôall who read this to the end!",1609483664

gaming,2021,1,"I posted a picture of Watchdogs Legions ray tracing recently. Many people said ray tracing was no different to screen space reflections and cube maps. Ray tracing is much more than those. Normally in games when you look into a window the reflection isn't a real reflection of what's actually there. Its just a fake stuck on reflection to give off the impression of a reflection. Or a random blocky mess of nothing. A reflection of a light onto a puddle of shiny surface tends to just reflect in the one spot near it. With ray tracing the reflections are real time reflections. Windows reflect what is actually there, and everything moves within the reflection. And lights reflect all over and change depending on angle. For example. Look at the second picture below at the red underground sign. It reflects in the puddle on the path below and ripples with the water. Then look at the first picture of the red bus. You can see that same red underground sign reflect on the side of the bus which is across the road. Then when the bus drives past you can see the underground sign reflect in a shop window. Or the lorry in the third picture. You can see the reflections in the side with the pedestrian walking away. Its all real reflections now. I wasn't sold at first. But after seeing it first hand i'm impressed.

gaming,2021,1,"***Novel up ahead, which includes some Super Mario 63 spoilers. I have the spoilers hidden, but skip to the TL;DR if ya'd like to anyways.***

7 years ago, I was pretty young to the world of the internet. All I searched really was ""mario games"". There were many cheap Flash games that kept little ol' me entertained, but not for long on each one. I then stumbled upon a brilliant flash game called Super Mario 63. Whether it was computer time at school or a spare moment at my home's computer, I would log on *just* to play it. While my memories from those times are now a little blurry, I remember that I would ALWAYS come back to it...and never actually complete it.

Even then, I had my fun back then. Finding secret tunnels in the castle, choosing my own path, and listening to the best soundtrack a flash game could ever wish for...it made me happy. Travel forward all the way to 2 months ago. My gamer sense had evolved significantly, but I still made time for other things. Especially considering the pandemic being as scary as it is, I hung out with my little brother here and there. I played Papa-ria games and other sorts of stuff on Coolmath when I was on the computer, but then I remembered that Flash was gonna die after December of 2020. It then occurred to me that I never actually finished Super Mario 63.

So then, I set out to 100% it. As silly as that sounds, I had to do it. Complete home school, hang out and play online with friends, and *then* hop on Super Mario 63 whenever I got the chance. There were many set backs, and tbh I almost let it slip my mind. But, my brother wouldn't let it go. He annoyed me by saying ""You still gotta complete Super Mario 63"". And, I'm glad he bugged me over and over. After doing a little research, I meticulously scavenged each level for Shine Sprites and Star Coins.

Lag set me back a bit, as it made Mario have a ""speed force"" effect (if you know the super hero Flash, then you might get what I'm saying). It allowed me to cheese through walls to skip a section if I really needed to, but most of the time it just put me out of bounds and effectively back to square 1 on a level. I could only combat it by muting the music and zooming out the page. There weren't many levels that REALLY suffered from this tho, so most of my play time was of discovery and of joy.

I got to jump and dive just like I did back then all over again. I found stages and areas that younger me never found. I talked to Toads&gt;!, a platypus, and a Mewtwo!&lt; that I never got the chance to talk to before. I then finally reached the final boss level, the one that would set the record straight. After figuring out that the last 3 star coins were there and hearing ""This is it, Luigi!"" from my brother, I slingstarred out to it. Lag forced me to take unusual routes, but I endured that. I collected the red coin Shine Sprite, and then the Star Coins, and finally got to the final boss (after cheesing through using the lag to my advantage).

Oh, did it ring nostalgic deja vu. It reminded me a lot of the Super Mario Galaxy final boss, and although it was easy, it was still satisfying to finally defeat Bowser in this game. &gt;!After the Metroid-esque run-away-from-impending-doom level, I got to see Mario fly to safety. Him looking diagonal towards the Horizon after landing...it rang Street Fighter Ryu vibes ngl. It just made the 63 Shine Sprites and the 63 Star Coins all the more fulfilling.!&lt;

But wait! There was one more secret level I had to complete! I only had half an hour before New Years, and supposedly the death of Flash. I had to rush through it, but of course lag had to kick in. It made the level almost unplayable, but I was forced to endure it. With a series of button presses, I could ""speed force"" my way through the first section...but all was in vain. I would skip the Star Coin when glitching, and I couldn't accept anything less than 100% completion. Unfortunately, it was too late to do anything, let alone turn around. I had to go join my family for the New Years celebration.

What had been setting me back, you may ask? Well, tbh...my younger brother. Every time I came over to play Super Mario 63, he'd be showing me silly videos and chat and whatnot. The beauty of my stubbornness to 100% Super Mario 63 is that it gave me an excuse to be with him. That was what I had really cherished. So, when my brother was blaming himself for my loss and saying ""I shouldn't have been distracting you!"" ten seconds before 2021 rang in, I responded with:

""But I got to hang out with you and have fun. That's all I care about.""

2021 was now in session. We had cinnamon buns from Pizza Hut, and I had some of my leftover Squirt soda from my dinner. Here's to hoping things will turn better this year! Anyways, I returned back to my seat hoping against hope that maybe Super Mario 63 would still be up...and it was!! I still had a chance!!! I rushed back to the castle roof to fly to the last secret level, and the rest is history. After painstaking penguin parkour and flying, I got the last Star Coin. After getting lucky with my wall phase glitch, I got the last Shine Sprite.

I opened the last Star Coin reward door (&gt;!the mush-room!&lt;), and had an unfortunate laggy floor phase-through turn into a majestically fall with coins all around me. I went to go to find the end game easter egg. After kicking Bowser's butt again, and seeing the credits again...

&gt;!""Hey, you're pretty good! See ya next time!""!&lt;

&gt;! Yee...see you next time, Pizanno.!&lt; And with that...like I said...a bittersweet goodbye. Flash is gone, just about. I know there's still the Newgrounds Player thing, but just in case that doesn't work, I wanted to finish the game for myself. There's now a lot of Flash content out there that's gone, probably including one that had a stick man with orange pants that I had wanted to get into. Idk, I might be wrong and maybe the Flash transition is going along smoother than I thought. All I know it that I'm thankful for the memories it already gave.

And in case a lot of Flash content IS gone: *Don't cry because it's gone; smile because it happened.* I wish all the best luck for future generations of first time internet searchers, old veteran gamers, and everyone in (and out) between!

**TL; DR:** From making younger me think Super Mario 64 was a rip-off of it, to still giving a more nuanced and demanding gamer a fun time, Super Mario 63 was a testament to the quality and impact that Flash games could have. I'm saying my goodbyes to it now. Thank you Runouw, Flash, Nintendo, and everybody else that could add to the experience. Hope to see that spirit and fusion of efforts manifest somewhere else in the contemporary world. Anyways, take care now y'all!",1609489783

We were promised a lot with No Mans Sky, and so many of you believed their lies and pre-ordered. Same thing with watch dogs and now Cyberpunk. I think it's hilarious seeing all people who hyped up the games way too much and pre-ordered them, to later complain like cry babies that the games suck when they finally get to play it.

Can all you folks just try to keep it in your pants this year?

I want to share this old TB video, where he talks about why pre-ordering is hurting the industry. It's years old, but most of it is still relevant today. Here's the [video](https://youtu.be/mf5Uj4XIT1Y).

At the moment I mostly play Insurgency, but most of the player base plays that game like CoD, I‚Äôve tried ARMA but that game was a little too much for me. I‚Äôm looking for a game that is easily accessible and fun while still being realistic. I want to try Squad but my current system can‚Äôt run it. From videos, Ghost Recon Wildlands and Breakpoint seem to kinda be what I‚Äôm looking for, just curious if any one out there has any other suggestions for other MIL-SIM, team based style games.

The most important thing for developers is to sell lots of copies, and get people hyped for a potential sequel.

Games as a service is the idea that when you buy a game for $50, $60, $70, or download one for free, you get a bare bones baseline experience of the game with most of the best content locked behind pay walls such as DLC, loot boxes, and other microtransactions. The most important thing to developers is to make games that are specially designed to get people addicted to investing cash into the game.

Your pal places this 'thing' into your lap to then hold and play with. It's some uncomfortable, generic 3rd party controller!? What u do?",1609505551
gaming,2021,1,"So I'll explain my goals here, which aren't really gaming oriented for the most part ... but I solicit your advice because you probably know better than most what what's when it comes to TV's vs Monitors and quality.


My plan is to setup a desk, with a couple workstations for development ... a headless/beat-to-a-pulp intel macbook .... an ARM mini-computer (that I'm hoping to develop into two things, maybe 3 .... NAS, REAL internet link aggregation (not fail-over), and perhaps even tivo-style video recording/playback/etc if the chipsets support it ... though the main goal is the internet link aggregation.  Basially, you can take your xfinity cable + xfinity wifi + LTE + DSL and it will behave like oen FAST pipe through a sort of ""VPN"" (it's encrypted, but honestly not really a VPN just the best anology I can give you).



SO I want this workstation for those reason, AND I have a switch for gaming .... so I don't necerilly need the best resolution since my gaming platform is stuck at 720p.  Though I'd like to get the highest quality monitor or TV I can afford.


TCL brand TV's are going these days for &lt; 200 for UHD 4k.... are *enormous*.   The last TV I owned was 24"" and I thought that was plenty big.  I live in a studio, so space *is* a premium but I could probably fit a 30-40"" TV on a desk and use it as a monitor/tv for my workstation and gaming.

Though the pixel density is growing to be grosely worse than a monitor, and it will probably destroy my eyesight for doing all of the computer programming stuff right?


That leaves me wtih finding a QHD or maybe UHD display in the size range of 26-32"".  The bigger ones are really out of my budget, but maybe I can find one used .. or refurbished that would fit the bill.


Are there any brands you guys recommend?  Am I insane for thinking about saving money on a TV I'm only going to be using for gaming like 5% of the time on my workstation?   Or are the TV's that good these days, that there's just not much difference and i might as well save my money and buy the TV that has better specs than the UHD monitors?


sincerely guy who has been house-bound and isolated since long before covid for some health problems :)   THANKS IN ADVANCE.

gaming,2021,1,"So I was really impressed graphically by this game in maxed out settings at first.

[That is, until I reached the Vietnam mission. What the hell is going on here? Not so much in terms of graphical fidelity, but in terms of completely messed up scale of things. When you fly in the helicopter it feels like you fly through some tiny toy soldier arena. Everything feels way too small, mountains look like tiny hills, distances are extremely short, etc. I remember even Vietcong 1 offering a bigger sense of scale 20 years ago. The most ridiculous part is at the end when the fighter jets drop the bombs while flying what looks like 5 meters above ground level. I get theyre not going to have them fly kilometers above for presentation reasons but the way they did it it already felt like a parody, as if they were coming out of the treetops.](/spoiler)

So how can they get the sense of scale so wrong? They must have all the resources to do better and some designer or whatever must have noticed at some ponts that it looks simply wrong?

Also pls advise if I marked spoilers correctly, it looks weird on my phone.",1609505875

gaming,2021,1,"I bought Northgard which is fun, but I am looking for something that has a little more depth to it. I don't want something that is too crazy like Civilization that has a steep learning curve, but somewhere between the two. Now in a perfect world I would also love if it had mythology in it such as dragons, werewolves, vampires, mermaids, etc etc. Perhaps even have it be steam workshop compatible so people can input creatures that didn't make the cut. In a perfect world scenario I'd also love if it offered gameplay simular to Anno where you could build your kingdom. 

This might be asking for TOO much, but one can hope! I know that Age of Mythology but that is a little dated. I like older games, but early 2000s is kinda cutting it unless people swear by it. Warhammer could be a possibility, but that also seems to have a steep learning curve similar to Civ?

Would you say that Civ or War hammer has a deeper learning curve? Maybe I'll pick up War Hammer since it is on sale and have Civ 6 (or 5) from Epic.

While improvised alcohol firebombs have been used for a hundred years or so, the name Molotov Cocktail comes from the Soviet-Finnish war of 1939. The term was coined by Finnish soldiers who, upon hearing Soviet propaganda by Vyacheslav Molotov, joked that these bomb, which we used to destroy tanks, were to accompany Molotov as a drink to go with his food. Thus the name ""Molotov Cocktail"" was made.

This means that Yharnam A: takes place during or after WW2, B: has the name Molotov, or C: is its own universe and I'm just having fun making nonsense theories about a simple and apt translation.

gaming,2022,1,"First it starts with nebulous viral marketing. ""Wow it's just like Breath of the Wild, but it's for free! Wow, it's like Cyberpunk but with less bugs (BC it has less content)!! WOW its JUST like Team Fortress II but with GIRLS!!""

You check the game out. It has some name like, Virtue Fantasia DX or whatever. Its about high school gamer girls doing gun fights in a virtual reality setting but you don't actually aim or shoot the guns, whether you win or lose depends entirely on stats.

You think it's lame but then you scroll through the roster and your dick gets super hard because one of them is your waifu and you just can't resist even though you've seen that exact same kind of character in fifty other games, look at her, she's so cute! She has cat ears, a prominent canine tooth, a rocket launcher, AND she's a milf who goes ""Ara ara""??? You fall in love. 

You play the game for free for a while, building up the necessary in game currency (with some dumb name like ""Poor Man's Dust"") to try and roll for her. Eventually after weeks of playing it's suddenly more difficult to earn Poor Man's Dust. You ran out of intro missions and now all you can do is grind, or continue the game with your current roster of non-cat girl MILFs. Of course you can't accept that. You look up if there's an easier way to acquire the character you want.

Turns out there are two, each of which require an upgrade to a Premium Account by buying an NFT token on the Ethereum based blockchain. You can spend money to buy more PM Dust, OR you can buy cat girl MILF DIRECTLY... AS AN NFT!

What's this? Oh no. Turns out they've very expensive. They cost 200 Ethereum which is the equivalent of $50 no $200 dollars no $7 no wait wait $671, that's so much.

Luckily all the free-to-play virtual gunner girls you earned are also fully tradeable NFTs. So you start to dabble in the ingame marketplace. Soon enough you find yourself fully enthralled - the negotiations, the rerolls, the grinding, the gains! Slowly and surely you find yourself making real money as you're spending it! For every $100 you spend, you get back $2. Who knows what that could add up to after playing for months!

Finally you become a fully certified whale, carrying the entire F2P economy on your back. You look at your massive stash of crypto and finally - at long last - you buy your beloved cat girl MILF. You're enthralled. Not only is she the woman of your dreams with her tight shorts and sensitive personality and demon wings, but she's a fully decentralised NFT, which means you'd still own the receipt for her even when the game shuts down!

So anyway the game shuts down. But the receipt for your waifu remains with you. One day, they will open a new game that you can play her in. But until that day comes, you are satisfied staring into the receipt depicting your waifu's eyes, brushing your hands through the receipt of your waifu's hair, and -

Hold on. They just made a new NFT Gacha Game about high school girls surviving an ikesai fantasy world. It's just like a free to play Super Mario Odyssey! And... Is one of the characters a spunky tomboy childhood friend with a tan and a monocle?!?

You roll up your sleeves, tap your substantial crypto wallet, and feel the itch of your irrepressible gambling addiction. Time to get back into the rodeo.",1641006258

Sounds simple, but for a long time this would contribute to me abandoning games. Couldn't get past the first level on hard mode? Pfft, I'll play something else. Missed an unmissable secret? Dammit I'll never get 100% now, I'll play something else. I'm not sure why I had imposed these limitations on myself, but lifting them was liberating.

Really curious to see how this turns out but I have noticed throughout my years of controller gaming that there is really 2 ways people use analog sticks.

\- First: Kind of like a flicking the analog stick whichever needed direction.(I think this may be just on the look stick) And I have noticed I do this more on an Xbox controller rather than a Playstation one.

\- Second: Fluid movement and control of the stick. (I don't think I do this way much, I typically flick my analog for whatever reason) However, I do have more fluid movement with a Playstation controller.

I could be absolutely wrong, this is just from my personal experience and I just wanted to know if anyone else had a similar view or opinions on which way is better for them.",1641015535

gaming,2022,1,"I started playing video games back in the Nintendo era but I really fell in love with gaming when the N64 came out. Zelda OoT changed my life. I was a consistent gamer until the Wii came around. That was the last console I owned until the switch. The switch had some fun games. I loved BotW but that was about it. Luigi's mansion didn't keep my attention. NBA 2K required too much money to be fun and only the party games kept me entertained when people came over. 

I thought I might just be too old for gaming and it's not for me anymore. I tried playing on my computer and got GTA V and I couldn't get into it all I wanted to do was steal cars and shoot people. I played CS:GO and that was a horrible idea. I played Prey since I got it for free recently and I couldn't get into it. I was resigned to just quit playing video games. That was until a yesterday. 

Epic gave away the latest Tomb Raider trilogy and I have to say that Tomb Raiders has to be one of the greatest games ever! I will get lost in the story and game play that hours will just fly by. The transition between cut scenes and gameplay are flawless. The different options of how to approach the game are so much fun and for me personally the upgrade system isn't convoluted. I'm loving this game and I want more like it!

I'm not looking for a PS4 game.. I already plan on getting the Uncharted Remaster and GTA V Enhanced Edition when they both come out.. But I have $100 PS Gift Card to spend on games now lol

For my PS5, I currently own Vanguard, Madden 22, Spider-Man (Remastered), Miles Morales, NBA 2K22, Riders Republic, AC Valhalla, MLB 21 The Show, and THPS 1+2.. My favorite games are GTA V, RDR2, and both of the recent Spider-Man games..

I am trying to decide what I should get.. I could get 2, possibly even 3 (or more) games with the current Holiday Sale going on.. I wouldn't mind a game that actually uses the PS5 technology (haptic feedback, adaptive triggers, etc).. But similar to GTA or RDR2.. Far Cry 6 was on my list for a while but I haven't been very impressed with what I've seen since the release.. Got the GTA Trilogy for the PS5 because it caught my attention since they were all childhood games for me but I've been stumped on what else to get..

I'm currently looking at (not in any order):

‚Ä¢ $24.99 - CP2077.. I know it's technically a PS4 game and had dreadful reviews early on, but apparently runs a lot better on PS5..

‚Ä¢ $30 Upgrade - GoT (Director's Cut).. I've played it several times before on PS4 version, but wasn't sure if I upgraded, if it would keep my progress for NG+ (I don't wanna grind all over again)

‚Ä¢ $41.99 - NHL 22.. I'm a big sports gamer, not really a big hockey guy.. But I can get sucked into a career mode if it's not too repetitive. Also wasn't sure how good the graphics/fps were for this one

‚Ä¢ $38.99 - Guardians of the Galaxy.. I don't know much about the movies.. But, it doesn't look so bad by watching the trailer. Story looks like it could be a little cheesy but gameplay looks pretty solid..

‚Ä¢ $100 or under - Whatever recommendations you may have.. Mix and match what I've listed with what you think may be a better choice.. I am all ears.. Just remember what I said a few paragraphs above this.. GTA and RDR2 are my favorite games ever.. I am dying for a modern open world game that actually tells a good story..

gaming,2022,1,"Hi, I need of an outside opinion on what game should I get. Currently, I'm using an ASUS VivoBook (not the best, but at least it works.) and my storage in this thing is full, so I'm going to need to say goodbye to a game.

Here are my options:

\+ Keep the oldest game I have on this laptop: Genshin Impact

Genshin Impact does not appeal to me anymore as in an open-world RPG and I don't like the gacha system in the game. I don't log in much anymore unless it's some kind of new banner or freemogems (for wishes that don't have the guarantee of a good result). Plus, uninstalling it might open up spaces for 2 games( which the choices are below).I still feel something wrong about uninstalling it though.

\+Choice number 1: Hitman 2

I don't really know much about Hitman 2, but from what I've seen, I like the stealthiness of it and the storyline. I would welcome opinions about this.

\+Choice number 2: Halo Infinite

Again, I don't know much since I'm not really interested in games before (being an Asian kid is really a struggle) and Halo is something that I would call a classic since I was born In the late 2000s (2009, to be exact) and have not experienced the games like pokemon in the '90s or the games like  Halo in the early 2000s which to me seems really interesting.

\+Choice number 3: Destiny 2

I literally know nothing about Destiny 2",1641025137

gaming,2022,1,"Honestly just used that title to grab attention, but it‚Äôs my honest question as well.

I‚Äôve just bought the game for 10 bucks, I already have huge respect for the world building and characters are alright, but the game feels boring to me. I‚Äôm trying to figure out if I should stick with it.

I‚Äôm currently about 15 hours in, and it feels like the bulk of the game is just gathering ingredients and completing mundane tasks. I prefer games with a better combat system that feels less ‚Äúhack and slash.‚Äù

gaming,2022,1,"You hear this all the time, that AAA publishers force their devs to make the same game or copy other because it's not worth the risk innovating. 

Is there any proof of this being true, though? 

Look at Nintendo. They innovate all the time and yeah, some of their projects turn into blunders but that's mostly their smaller projects like Star Fox Zero for the Wii U. Their top franchises like Zelda and Mario always sell incredibly well despite Nintendo changing things up all the time. Just look at Breath of the Wild which became THE new formula for how open world should work. That was Nintendo taking a huge risk moving away from the classic formula, and they were rewarded for it. 

Meanwhile franchise fatigue is hitting series like Call of Duty and Battlefield hard and they both see declines in sales.",1641027414

So i was always using Mouse and Keyboard , so this holidays i got my self a PS5 controller since most of roguelite reccomend controller.

Damn my experience changed completely. It is amazing to just to chill back in my chair and play those amazing games. 
Instantly i had progress in those games that i didnt expect. I feel i became better.

gaming,2022,1,"Maybe I'm getting old... (hence, the ellipses)

It's just I have been trying to find a multiplayer game, where I can join in, meet up with some people and have fun. If that works out, I return, and there is some sort of community or something.

Back when Ultima Online came out, me and a friend, we'd not always play together, but we had a little corner of the world where we met people and had fun.

Battlefield 1942, played on many servers where they had a usual crowd, and people played and had fun, even with some of those that killed their own team.

Return to Castle Wolfenstein, same deal.

I play Baldur's Gate with friends I know. It's fun. I play Divinity 2, with people I know, it's fun. But everytime I try to join a game with people I don't know, it's hard to interact, it's hard to find any connection, and very hard to even see a community of players on a server or a game, even if I try.

I have Valheim, and I can play myself. But every server is locked.

For some reason, Battlefield: BC2 I can't login to, are the servers shut, or do I have to entangle with EA customer service to find the problem?

I have blasted my way thru Doom:2016 and Doom:Eternal, and have tried MP, but just no connection.

I'm not sure what I'm getting at, it just seems playing MP just isn't as fun. 

I hope someone can give a suggestion, or change my mind.",1641033283

So they ruin the entire match for everyone, and they keep doing this persistently, but they can  also do this for Co-Op! Basically Online playing with other players is under a threat.

To my understanding this exploit or bug has been present for a long time and nothing has been done, but now its getting much much worse, more and more players are complaining, personally I couldn't find a server not ruined by this. 

There really has to be some accountability for this, both for the publishers and the hackers, there just has to be more done, and such malice and incompetence have to bee seeked out and punished by the governmental authorities. If a company sold let's say vacuum cleaners and someone was tampering with them, to ruin them they would be arrested by authorities, likewise often companies would get forced by regulations or at least public image to ensure their product cannot be tampered easily to endanger the consumer or ruin his purchase.

gaming,2022,1,"[https://www.hd.square-enix.com/eng/news/2022/html/a\_new\_years\_letter\_from\_the\_president\_2.html](https://www.hd.square-enix.com/eng/news/2022/html/a_new_years_letter_from_the_president_2.html)

 

&gt;I would like to begin by wishing everyone a Happy New Year.  
&gt;  
&gt;The metaverse was a hot topic in 2021, inspiring a lively global conversation first about what the metaverse is and then about what sort of business opportunities it presents. Against this backdrop, Facebook changed its name in October to Meta, serving as evidence that the concept is not a mere buzzword but here to stay. The metaverse garnered so much attention that 2021 was dubbed the ‚ÄúMetaverse Year‚Äù  
&gt;  
&gt;I attribute this in large part to advances in extended reality (XR) technology, the increasing prevalence of the cloud and 5G, more sophisticated blockchain technology, and other technological evolutions that have taken place in a variety of fields over the past several years. That is because these advances are giving rise to services that fall under the metaverse umbrella. The metaverse will likely see a meaningful transition to a business phase in 2022, with a wide range of services appearing on the scene. As this abstract concept begins to take concrete shape in the form of product and service offerings, I am hoping that it will bring about changes that have a more substantial impact on our business as well.  
&gt;  
&gt;Another term that gained quick currency in 2021 was ‚ÄúNFT‚Äù or ‚Äúnon-fungible token.‚Äù The advent of NFTs using blockchain technology significantly increased the liquidity of digital goods, enabling the trading of a variety of such goods at high prices and sparking conversations the world over. I see 2021 not only as ‚ÄúMetaverse: Year One,‚Äù but also as ‚ÄúNFTs: Year One‚Äù given that it was a year in which NFTs were met with a great deal of enthusiasm by a rapidly expanding user base. However, we do observe examples here and there of overheated trading in NFT-based digital goods with somewhat speculative overtones, regardless of the observed value of the content provided This, obviously, is not an ideal situation, but I expect to see an eventual right-sizing in digital goods deals as they become more commonplace among the general public, with the value of each available content corrected to their true estimated worth, and I look for them to become as familiar as dealings in physical goods.  
&gt;  
&gt;To address these changes in our business environment, the medium-term business strategy that we unveiled in May 2020 identified AI, the cloud, and blockchain games as new domains on which we should focus our investments, and we have subsequently been aggressive in our R&amp;D efforts and investments in those areas.  
&gt;  
&gt;In the AI space, we established SQUARE ENIX AI &amp; ARTS Alchemy Co., Ltd. (‚ÄúAI &amp; AA‚Äù) in March 2020 to pursue development efforts in the wider field of ‚Äúentertainment AI‚Äù rather than being constrained by traditional concepts of gaming AI. The firm‚Äôs R&amp;D efforts focus primarily on natural language processing, world models, and simulation technology. These efforts will help us develop the games that we release into the world and enhance their overall quality, but that is not all. By incorporating the output of these R&amp;D efforts into virtual avatars and elsewhere, we plan to apply that output to a wide variety of content and provide the relevant technology to other companies, with a view to leveraging these R&amp;D efforts across our entire Digital Entertainment business. ¬†  
&gt;  
&gt;We are exploring potential efforts in the cloud space from two primary perspectives, the first being leveraging cloud technologies to distribute content and the second being developing content that offers customers new forms of excitement enabled by the cloud‚Äôs attributes. More telecommunications infrastructure is being built, as exemplified by expanding 5G coverage. Devices are also making performance gains. As these trends continue, I believe that the content we provide will become more accessible, making it more likely that our customers will discover enjoyment as we gain new touchpoints with them. Leveraging cloud technologies is extremely effective as a means of making our content and services uniformly available and as a catalyst for creating new forms of excitement that expand upon the content development capabilities for which we are known. As such, we will be making ample investments in the cloud space. ¬†¬†  
&gt;  
&gt;Lastly is blockchain games. Be they single-player or online games, games have traditionally involved a unidirectional flow whereby creators such as ourselves provide a game to the consumers that play them. By contrast, blockchain games, which have emerged from their infancy and are at this very moment entering a growth phase, are built upon the premise of a token economy and therefore hold the potential to enable self-sustaining game growth. The driver that most enables such self-sustaining game growth is diversity, both in how people engage with interactive content like games, and in their motivations for doing so. Advances in token economies will likely add further momentum to this trend of diversification. I see the ‚Äúplay to earn‚Äù concept that has people so excited as a prime example of this.¬†  
&gt;  
&gt;I realize that some people who ‚Äúplay to have fun‚Äù and who currently form the majority of players have voiced their reservations toward these new trends, and understandably so. However, I believe that there will be a certain number of people whose motivation is to ‚Äúplay to contribute,‚Äù by which I mean to help make the game more exciting. Traditional gaming has offered no explicit incentive to this latter group of people, who were motivated strictly by such inconsistent personal feelings as goodwill and volunteer spirit. This fact is not unrelated to the limitations of existing UGC (user-generated content). UGC has been brought into being solely because of individuals‚Äô desire for self-expression and not because any explicit incentive existed to reward them for their creative efforts. I see this as one reason that there haven‚Äôt been as many major game-changing content that were user generated as one would expect.  
&gt;  
&gt;However, with advances in token economies, users will be provided with explicit incentives, thereby resulting not only in greater consistency in their motivation, but also creating a tangible upside to their creative efforts. I believe that this will lead to more people devoting themselves to such efforts and to greater possibilities of games growing in exciting ways. From having fun to earning to contributing, a wide variety of motivations will inspire people to engage with games and connect with one another. It is blockchain-based tokens that will enable this. By designing viable token economies into our games, we will enable self-sustaining game growth. It is precisely this sort of ecosystem that lies at the heart of what I refer to as ‚Äúdecentralized gaming,‚Äù and I hope that this becomes a major trend in gaming going forward. If we refer to the one-way relationship where game players and game providers are linked by games that are finished products as ‚Äúcentralized gaming‚Äù to contrast it with decentralized gaming, then incorporating decentralized games into our portfolio in addition to centralized games will be a major strategic theme for us starting in 2022. The basic and elemental technologies to enable blockchain games already exist, and there has been an increase in the societal literacy and acceptance of crypto assets in the past few years. We will keep a close eye on societal shifts in this space while listening to the many groups of users that populate it, and ramp up our efforts to develop a business accordingly, with an eye to potentially issuing our own tokens in the future.  
&gt;  
&gt;Our lifestyles have changed, and we are learning to coexist with COVID-19. Against that backdrop, I believe that the new technologies and concepts that I have discussed and the changes that they bring to our business environment will provide us with numerous opportunities to enrich people‚Äôs lives through digital entertainment, which is at the core of our business. This at the same time means that we are seeing the beginnings of further leaps forward for our business. We remain committed to creating, developing, and providing world-class content, and we will contribute to the happiness of society and its people by offering new forms of excitement.  
&gt;  
&gt;I wish you all the best for 2022.

I am still considering getting one. Mostly because i have a couple of toddlers who want to try gaming a bit. I guess it's easier with a gamepad controller, but I can just buy that to use with PC. I also know there are some titles that are exclusive to eg. PS.

I guess it will be cheaper getting a console or two than getting 1-2 gaming PCs...

Are there any other reasons I should have in mind about why going for a PS/Xbox instead of PC?",1641045658

gaming,2022,1,"**Tl;dr 1 -** I am an amateur game researcher so my predictions will probably be way off on some of these, but last year I made a post like this and it went pretty well so I thought I would do it again. Here is the list: **Apex Legends, Star Wars: Hunters, Pok√©mon Unite, Diablo Immortal, Frostborn, Odin: Valhalla Rising, Devil May Cry, Clash Heroes, Total War Battles: Warhammer, Battlefield Mobile.** (already regretting not mentioning Albion and maybe one other, but oh well) (explanations are in the post)

**tl;dr 2 -** I made all of this with game footage into a short HQ video here [https://youtu.be/7-TakjaKy30](https://youtu.be/7-TakjaKy30)

But for those of you who rather read, here is the video script:

Today is the first day of 2022, and there are already close to 2000 new mobile games ready to download. Most of these games are absolutely horrible, but some of them are quite amazing. Ten of which are definitely going to be the best mobile games of 2022.  
Let me start off by saying this video is not talking about the games on the top charts of the Play Store or the App Store. Those games are kitschy at best and at worst complete trash. This is because those games use advertising techniques that are very successful with the young and inexperienced mobile games player base. But there are some mobile games that are truly amazing and take off among serious gamers. Those are the games I have analyzed and here are the top 10 mobile games for 2022.

**The first game on the list is Apex Legends.** The reason I chose this game as the number one game for 2022 is because it is a battle royale shooter computer game port. And for the last four years of mobile gaming, battle royale shooter computer game ports have been in the top three favorites for serious mobile gamers. I believe the reason for this is because computer game ports are often viewed as a safe option for serious gamers because uniquely mobile games often carry with them the bad reputation of mobile gaming. This, of course, doesn't mean that all uniquely mobile games are bad, but it does mean that a lot of serious gamers are wary of trying them out until they've been tested out by others. And then the battle royale style fits really well with the mobile phone because you're only committing to 20 to 30 minutes at a time. So that is why I think Apex Legends is going to be the number one competitive mobile game for 2022. Unfortunately the game announced that it will not come out until quarter three of this year so it'll be coming kind of late in the year. Nevertheless, it will be coming out this year which is why I have it on this list whereas games like Valorant which I think will do really well on the mobile phone are not going to be coming out this year and therefore did not make the list even though there's a lot of hype about that mobile game.

**The second game on the list is Star Wars: Hunters.** This is a unique mobile game and I think it is going to do incredibly well in the mobile platform. Star Wars: Hunters is set up as 4v4 arena battles where you choose unique heroes from the Star Wars Universe. They did a really good job of making them unique and somehow balancing all of the characters ranging from droids to jedis. It is a Star Wars game which is a theme that does well among competitive gamers, but more importantly it is a unique competitive game that already has hype among the gaming community. So I definitely see this game being one of the top games for this year.

**The third game on the list is Pok√©mon Unite.** This game is already out, but it is still at a high point and climbing. It is a 5v5 arena battle that feels like a moba, but has its own unique flairs to it. Pokemon as a company has done really well on the mobile phone with Pokemon Go being a big part of the mobile rush in 2016. This has resulted in giving them a significant mobile player base, but pokemon unite attracts more competitive gamers allowing them to expand their player portfolio even further.

**For the fourth game on the list we have Diablo Immortal.** This game has been highly anticipated by mobile gamers for years now. In fact, it has the record for the longest anticipated mobile game of all time. But after all of this waiting, six months ago, they did release the closed beta and it seems like this year it will finally come to the mobile phone. For those of you who don't know Diablo Immortal is a hack and slash mmorpg that has had really dynamic gameplay three years ago. And those playing the closed beta say it's only gotten better so after all this time it is confirmed that this game is truly coming this year and it should be everything we had hoped for.

**The fifth game on the list is Frostborn.** I predicted this would be one of the top games for 2021, but the game developers kept letting bugs through their game updates and it pretty much destroyed the game. Reviews plummeted below 3 stars and the game didn't go anywhere. Now a year later it seems like the developers have not only gotten the bugs under control enough to get their rating back up to a 4.2, but it seems like they're finally ready to start releasing some of the more dynamic aspects of the game. In the update they released last week they introduced a new Tarkov type event which has the players of the game ecstatic. The reason why I think this will be a top game for 2022 is because it is the best mobile game of its type. I'm sure many of you remember the game Last Day on Earth from 2017, but it is built with better technology creating better graphics and it also allowed them to integrate multiplayer throughout the game. I wasn't planning on adding it to this list, but two months ago the game doubled its download and again last month it doubled it again and that was before they just released this event which many of the frostborn players are saying is the best update the game has ever seen.

**The sixth game on the list is Odin: Valhalla Rising.** This is another game I predicted for last year, but sadly, it only came out in South Korea. Also, they ended up changing the name because it was originally Project: Odin, but as predicted this game is getting incredible reviews. And even got on the google nominee list for a top game in the most competitive even though it's only been available in one country which is pretty impressive. The game is an open world mmorpg and it has incredible graphics. It seems like Lionheart Studios is set on making this a AAA mobile game.

**The seventh game on the list is Clash Heroes**. This game is made by Supercell which means it will get lots of downloads, but as I said in the beginning of this video this list is not based on how many downloads it's going to get in the Play Store, but rather how popular it will be among serious gamers. The reason why I think this game will be popular among serious gamers is because it is going to be kind of a unique game for the mobile phone. Clash Heroes looks like it's going to be kind of a Minecraft Dungeons game which there's not a lot of those and I think it's gonna do really well for the mobile phone because it doesn't have a lot of time commitment each time you play. Now I do think this game will be more casual than a lot of the other games that I usually put on these lists mainly because Minecraft Dungeons is still a little bit more of a casual game than some of these other games, but also because it's Supercell and Supercell has had a tendency to make more casual games. Now I will admit that ever since Tencent took over ownership of Supercell, they have reduced some of the paywall. Those of you who played Clash of Clans know that they had a paywall to make it to where you simply couldn't max out your base without paying thus giving you a disadvantage and while that is still true of Supercell and a lot of their games, you can see in games like Brawl Stars, they're toning it down just a little bit and I think that has to do with Tencent.

**The eighth game on the list is Devil May Cry.** As I have mentioned in other videos about this game, there aren't a lot of high quality mobile games like this one. So I believe this game will perform really well on the mobile market. I thought it was going to come out last year, but unfortunately, they only released it in China. Now it did make it to the top download charts which is hopefully an indicator that I was and am right in putting it on this list, but we will just have to see when it is released globally. Lastly, I think the flexibility offered in the fighting styles of this game will be very attractive to the serious mobile gamer.

**The ninth game is Total War Battles: Warhammer.** Even though the Total War Series was one of my favorites on the PC growing up, I almost overlooked this game because I do not think real time strategy is a good fit for the mobile phone. It is just too difficult to manage so many troops and buildings without hotkeys and not being able to right click causes a failed attempt to select something an absolute nightmare. But then when I saw that Creative Assembly contracted Netease to create the game, it changed my mind. Regardless of what you might think about Netease, they are brilliant at translating games to the mobile phone. Their understanding of the limitations and strengths of the phone in combination with their awareness of how a gamer thinks and feels allows them to innovate peerlessly. Even the giants of the gaming world don‚Äôt try to compete with them. They either copy them or in this case, they hire them. So with the combination of a great series and great developers, I am putting this game in the top 10 for 2022.

**And then the last game is Battlefield Mobile.** This is another computer port, but it is different enough from the other games like it that I think it will do really well. As mobile gaming technology keeps getting better, big battles are becoming more and more appealing so this will offer something unique to the gaming world. And EA is a big company that is starting to get desperate to get into the mobile gaming trend so I have a feeling they will advertise the heck out of this game. And that, of course, doesn't make the game better but it does affect how many serious gamers will try it out. Okay. So those are the top 10 mobile games of 2022, but I do have 3 honorable mentions:  
This first one is Lost Light. This game was created by Netease and they did an incredible job. I got really addicted to this game during its early release and it seems like the game has only gotten better. It is already out and gaining a lot of popularity. It is basically a mobile version of the game ‚ÄúEscape from Tarkov‚Äù, but they made it feel like it‚Äôs own unique thing and did a great job of giving it the best of what mobile gaming has to offer.  
The second honorable mention is Tomb Raider: Reloaded which is a new mobile game that is getting a lot of attention. Personally, I am not so sure. The graphics look a bit kitschy and remind me too much of your typical mobile game, but I have been surprised before and there is a lot of hype around the game, that I felt like I needed to mention it.

And then lastly, there is Genshin Impact which quickly rose to the top charts of 2021, but recently plummeted with a bad anniversary gift causing the players to try and cancel the game. Which kind of worked. The game did not get a single award on google play for 2021 and it‚Äôs reviews are still down even though google deleted many of the bad reviews. I am not sure they will ever recover so I definitely don‚Äôt think the game will be a top game for 2022.  
Well, that is it guys. Hope that helps. If you feel like there was a game that should have been on here that wasn‚Äôt, it probably wasn‚Äôt because I missed it. I did a lot of research on 100s of games and this is what I have come up with. That doesn‚Äôt mean they are the best, but it does mean that they are the ones I think are the best. That being said, over the next few weeks, I will be doing top 10 videos for each genre revealing even more of these serious mobile games. If you have a game you want me to consider, please put it in the comments of the video. I will read them and make sure I have researched every game mentioned.  
Alright guys, I will see you next time.

**tl;dr 1 -** I am an amateur game researcher so my predictions will probably be way off on some of these, but last year I made a post like this and it went pretty well so I thought I would do it again.

Edit: The challenge is more at your discretion. Yeah, you are striving towards 52 games for the year, but its more about starting and finishing things. So, if you started a game 5 years ago and decide to boot it up and wrap up the last bit, call it a completion. If you want to play a game that can be beaten in an hour, count it. The point is to complete things, not just hit a total. With multiplayer only games, I usually base it on a combination of some form of progress and time played.",1641048692

gaming,2022,1,"Four major errors in [IGN's new top 100](https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-100-video-games-of-all-time) that I just have to vent about:

1. Sonic the Hedgehog is not on the list?  I wasn't even a Sega guy in the 90s, but it was massive.  Literally drove console sales for the Genesis, and it's still fun to play.  At least one of the games from the series should be comfortably on this list.
2. Factorio.  This game is maybe slightly niche, but not nearly as niche as some of the entries on the list and it is also absolutely a monumental 10/10 game with no real peers.  It's one of those where if it's your cup of tea, you put 1000+ hours into, and it has been painstakingly perfected by its developers over the course of a decade.  Absolutely should be comfortably on the list.
3. Super Metroid is not the #5 game of all time.  I'm a Nintendo guy, I'm a Metroid guy, I played this game when it came out, it was a really good game.  It's definitely a really good game.  It's not the 5th best game of all time.  I would respect any ranking from like, #25 to #200, but it's bonkers to say its the 5th best of all time.  It wasn't massive when it released.  It doesn't hold up all that great.
4. Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island really shouldn't be on this list at all, and Mario Odyssey really should.  I feel like the only way you're going to put Yoshi's Island up there is if you were 9 years old when it came out.  I'm pretty sure no one else in history has fallen in love with this game enough to put it in the top 100.  It's a relative low point among mainline Mario franchises and sold only modestly well for a Mario.  On the other hand Odyssey is a brilliant Mario for all ages and skill levels, a massive success, and easily one of the best 3d platformers of all time.

Ok, rant over, but I also just want to also say:

1. IMHO, Splatoon 2 is easily a top 100 game of all time.  It's so easily the coolest and cleverest and most fun competitive shooter out there.
2. IMHO, Witcher 3 is just too flawed to be a top 20 game.  Top 100, sure.  There are some really great things about it, but Geralt just moves too clunkily and its quests are too obviously plotted out for you.
3. IMHO, Hades is super duper good--loved it--but I think we're going a little nuts to say #13 of all time.  I think with a little more historical perspective it will fade back a bit.
4. IMHO, on the other hand, this list is underselling Hollow Knight, especially compared to its forebears Super Metroid (see above) and Castlevania: Symphony of the Night, which are both ranked top 15.  Hollow Knight really elevated and perfected this genre in a way that I think transcended even those seminal namesakes of the Metroidvania genre.
5. IMHO, Smash Bros Ultimate should be a lot higher than 76.  It's an epic achievement by any measure and an insanely well-crafted game.

And I better stop myself there.  Thank you for listening, I needed to get that off my chest.",1641057908

It's a game in wich you could play as a ""space soldier"" (or something like that. a unreal tournament or quake design style, maybe) or as a creature. But the point is that as a creature your cam goes inside the creature's mouth, so you have a inner mouth cam while playing as creature.

The game was released, I think, around 2010's, but I could be wrong.

Probably one of those games that were removed from steam years ago.

gaming,2022,1,"So, it's new years day and I figured I'd check out some of the very well reviewed games that I missed in the previous year. I generally don't play a lot of games, I play a handful of games a lot instead. Right now, they're Valheim, Satisfactory and Factorio.

First up was Hades which I was excited about. Couldn't even install it as, for some reason, the XBox app wouldn't provide the drive that my games are saved onto as an option. Wonderful. 

Second was Forza Horizon 5. Installed fine, super fun when you were racing but, as someone coming from the Dirt and Grid series of racers, the interface is an absolute clusterfuck. I have zero idea what to do, what my priorities should be, there are 3? different experience point types, I'm still not exactly sure how to even change cars. It is super frustrating.

Then I tried Anno 1800 which I was also excited about. Downloaded and installed fine but first mission is broken. I can't move the ship at all so I can't get the dynamite. I search for a solution and see that this is an unsolved bug that has been around SINCE launch. Meanwhile, in that time, they've found the development manpower to release almost a dozen DLC packs - yet a bug that stops the game at step one is still a thing.

Why is it that small studios can make amazing games like Valheim while huge studios fuck up multimillion dollar titles? I looked back through all the games I played in the last year and - in almost every case - they weren't a major franchise or from a major studio. There is something seriously wrong with high budget game development and it's truly depressing.",1641064979

gaming,2022,1,"No shade intended, I've played it through twice myself, liked it much more the second time around when I played for korok seeds and got much more invested in the world than the shrines. But IGN calling it the best game of all time? I've seen dozens of discussions about it around reddit, but I've never seen anyone call it their actual favorite game. I feel like for a game to be the BEST EVARR it needs to at LEAST be the favorite all-time game of a large number of people.

There's millions of people who claim Dark Souls is their favorite game ever (I'm one of them), and I'm not saying it's the best game ever, but I feel like the amount of love its fans have for it speaks to its Greatness. Whereas BOTW, which I think we mostly agree is very good, I don't see the same vocal community for. Lots of supporters, but a lack of die-hards.

aside: this is not about dark souls vs. botw. just a comparison.

So who's got BOTW as their actual favorite game ever around here? If so, can you name like 2-3 of your other favorites just to get an idea of who you are as a gamer? It's a list-of-games-y kind of day, I guess.",1641065731

gaming,2022,1,"Okay so I just started Cyberpunk again after originally returning it on my PS5. This time I have an RTX 3080 and a Samsung G7 monitor...

Obviously there's still issues and there's no excuse for the bad launch. For ps5/series X console gamers, the fact that they are still running on last gen settings is embarrassing. The lack of any sort of true updates or DLC's is embarrassing. The bugs early on are embarrassing. The current bugs leave me scratching my head....

HOWEVER.

So far what I've been experiencing on PC is basically a masterpiece. They got a lot of hate for the first person view, but IMO it makes the game so much more immersive than GTA. The voice acting is top notch. The characters are top notch. The world, while empty and not very lively, is absolutely GORGEOUS with ray tracing set to max. The art style is just fabulous, sometimes I stop just to observe my settings and take in the beauty as they NAILED the bladerunner-ish atmosphere.

The main and side missions are both fantastic..... in fact I think this game has some of the best side missions that I've ever played in any open world game. IMO they are actually better than what the Witcher 3 had. Seriously cool concepts. I just got done playing that rock show on stage, and my god was that incredible.

The gunfights on console graphics felt cheesy, and very fallout 3 like. On PC you totally feel the intensity. I actually think the crafting and modding system is actually quite good...Not the best but certainly better than what I thought it would be.

Ultimately I judge a game based on if I feel like I NEED to keep playing it. I've played a lot of ""great"" games where halfway through, I was already looking at completion guides to see how much longer I have to finish the game....In this, I don't feel that at all. I just want to keep playing. During my ps5 experience of the game, I originally told a friend I would give it a 5/10 tops. Right now I would have to give it a 9.

I just hope future DLC's can fix some of the open world to make it more lively...",1641066621

gaming,2022,1,"This game is my original idea for a game.

The story (or lack there of ) is straight forward.

Horrible present, go back to the past and make a better future.

Pretty much a little like Majora's mask.

The game is third person shooter puzzle game but to me it's pretty much a time travel sandbox.

Have you ever heard/got asked ""would you kill baby Hitler?"" in this game you can do something similar ( that or you could do a less violent option -3- ).

In this game of mine it spans within 4 years.

And with each passing year the bosses grow up in four stages.

Infant.

Child.

Teen.

Elder.

With each passing year the bosses get stronger and so does their powers.

The game starts with D.A.S.H. waking up/turning on in a lab in a broken world.

So they explore this broken world and found an upgrade to be able to go back 4 years in the past to change the worlds future for the better.

As for the main villain of the game is ""you""/""D.A.S.H.""

D.A.S.H. was built to ""make a better future"" even though the government used them to a tool/weapon for the government's greed and lust for power.

So D.A.S.H. went back in time and made the bosses I've mentioned to torture the humanity.

And be for you say ""well would the current D.A.S.H. not exist if you have to fight them?""

It would be the same as restarting Undertale.

Making you the bad guy/villain for taking everyone's happy ending away.

In this game you would have a large range of powers like time travel (obviously), time stop, time shield, speed legs (sonic legs ), time doors, speed up singing (like the good kush in metal gear ;3 ) and many more.

As for the Graphics they would be low polygon graphics.

1: Low poly would equal to a more smoother gameplay experience ( given the fact there's a lot of stuff in the game it has to be low poly to run smoothly :T ).

2: Why does a game need smooth graphics??

And 3: it would give the game a good retro look.

And that's my idea for a unpopular game that'll never be made.

Don't bother commenting ""this sounds like a bad idea for a game"" because I already know that.

So if you have any questions be sure to tell me in the comments.

And if you were wondering, no, this game haven't been made.

But if it was it would be a PS5 exclusive given the fact it was mentioned that the PS5 could load two worlds at the same time.

And I want to see how much it could take with my game idea.",1641066784

Please don't recommend indie games either.

All I know of good triple AAA games are apex legends and halo infinite that have good online multiplayer.

Call of duty is already garbage .

Battlefield 2042 sucked this year...

WHAT ELSE DO I PLAY THEN ?  

I don't like playing single player games where you all you do is repeat yourself against the same AI.

Please tell me there is something else out there released in the past 3 years that has good online multiplayer, please give me hope.

Switch, desktop/laptop (both Mac and windows) and iPad.

I used to play with my little brother's Xbox one controller but now that I live alone I can't steal his. 

I wanted to buy a new one for me but I'm lost. I'm not a pro but I think the thing I'm looking for is a controller which work via Xinput. Joy-cons doesn't work because they are separated and remapping them before each game session is awful. But what about switch pro controller ? Would I be able to play Minecraft/call of duty on the iPad ? Same for monster hunter and gta on windows ? Or should I just buy an Xbox controller ? I wanted Bluetooth and being able to play everything with one controller. 
I will need your personal experience for the games, if you managed to play steam games with switch pro controller without any third party software, tell me

It feels like completing some of the games puzzles revolve entirely on either spending hours of trial and error or by relying on chance encounters with specific characters in specific towns that you couldn't possibly know about without straight up googling it. That's not to mention the obnoxious inability to even get around the map without either being forced to spend time finding ingredients to create elixirs allowing you to access cold/hot areas, or again hoping that happened to have found that one specific person in that one specific area that gives you what you need. Additionally, the combat is incredibly wonky and basic gameplay elements such as dodging are unintuitive. All in all, doing anything in the game is a slog that requires an obnoxious amount of effort just to actually play the game and even then, the gameplay itself is just not entertaining.",1641076266

gaming,2022,1,"It's the middle of winter and I'm in quarantine because of this stupid virus. Good thing all the big stores have winter sales going on, right? So I buy something I consider a guilty pleasure of mine: The newest COD: I don't exactly expect a great game, I generally know what I'm in for. But for the most part I usually enjoyed the single player campaign a fair bit. Mindless slaughter of AI bots, lot's of scripted events and if you play on the highest difficulty some kind of challenge as well. 

So I got Vanguard. And man am I pissed. This single player campaign is so bad, I am astonished that they published it like this. The engine of this game is the same since forever, what else are you developing?

(minor story spoilers ahead, but believe me, you aren't missing out on a lot either way)

1. The story is just....bad. I can somehow get behind a rag tag band of allied spec ops guys working together. But why does every character need to be so annoyingly cartoonish? The hot shot pilot, the responsible officer, the vengeful assassin, the super evil Nazi and his stupid beaurocratic little helper. It's as if they looked up [Flanderization](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flanderization) and thought: That's a good way of writing characters. And if your story is that badly written: Make less cutscenes. I want to play a game, not watch a somethign that wouldn't even have made a direct-to-VHS release in the 90s.

2. I have never played against an AI that's this  stupid. Seriously. How do you even do that? German soldiers that run right at me instead of shooting. German soldiers that run right at me, stop, turn and get behind cover, *facing away from me*. Every single mission. How does the AI get worse when you're making the same game year after year? How?

3. The scripted events bug out all the time. Oh so I'm on the wrong side of the character I have to interact with? Let's just teleport you to the right side. Or even better, just have him talk to the air while you stand behind him.

4. Who's idea was it to put quotes of the characters in the loading screen? It's cringy. It's like the developers want to show: Look how insightful our characters are. And every quote is something a 14 year old might confuse with a deep thought.

5. Why do I need to do **exactly the same shit** I've done in the other WW2 installations of CoD before? Attack coastal artillery in France? Yep. Lone sniper in Stalingrad? Been there, done that. Twice actually.

6. Every last bit of suspension of disbelief flies out of the window when Japanese soldiers in 1943 carry German assault rifles which went into service one year afterwards. In Europe. And why is everyone carrying a shotgun that looks like an expensive hunting weapon? Can you not just add a normal fucking shotgun?

7. Speaking of weapons. I get that Modern Warfare set the tone for weapon individualisation with their gunsmith stuff. But does that have to carry over into the campaign? Regular WWII soldiers did not have red dot sights on their rifles. Nobody had. And they didn't modify the stock or the magazine or anything else either.

8. Oh cool, you added a mission where you have to fly a dive bomber. Would be cool if your controls for flying were ... I don't know...responsive. And if the script for bombing the carrier would actually work. Because it doesn't. You die 3 times and then the 4th time you make it, even though you did absolutely nothing differently.

When I bought this game I did not expect a lot. But I did expect some mindless fun in the campaign. But this is so bad, I feel slightly offended that a publisher thought it's okay to release this. But I shouldn't be surprised I guess...",1641077008
