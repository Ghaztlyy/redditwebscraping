Overwatch,2020,1,"Hey guys, So I just got a new PC and currently installing OverWatch on it as I type this, Will I have to re add all my keybindings or will they ""just be there"" ? Reason I ask is when I googled it, this is what showed up.  

"" gameplay **settings** like sensitivity and keybindings are account specific and loaded **from the** Blizzard servers when you login""   

&amp;#x200B;

So does that mean they are saved to the servers / cloud type thing or will I need to add them?",2020-01-01 00:47:44

Overwatch,2020,1,"I used to play overwatch a lot when it first came out, and I only played Genji and widow (this was on Xbox one)

I got rid of my Xbox, but just recently got another one. I got overwatch for it (I really wish I got it for pc instead, all my old friends switched to pc and I don't have the money to get the pc version).

So now that I'm back on overwatch on Xbox one, I feel like I can't play Genji and widow at all, not like.. I'm not as good as I used to be... but like I legit can't play them, but they're the only ones I enjoy playing

&amp;#x200B;

With Genji my sensitivity is low so I can easily aim,  but then if I dash through an enemy it takes a long time to turn around, I tried turning my sensitivity up and playing with it for a week but now II turn around at a decent speed but I can't aim. I tried getting used to it.. but I can't.

&amp;#x200B;

What should I do? (Thanks for the help in advance)

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: With widow I just can't hit any shots even after adjusting my sensitivity a bit and trying it out for a few days/week.",2020-01-01 01:04:40

Worse part is that it's very selective of when it happens: On tank it lasts for the first minute or so, On support it kicks up towards the end of maps with timer and worse off is DPS which just refuses to stop ALL MATCH!

Overwatch,2020,1,"Name: Ripcord (Richard Herrin)   
  
Class: Support (backline healer)   
  
Origin: Canada, Labrador   
  
Weapon: Compact Restorative Charge Rifle. A surgical laser personally modified by Richard to be effective at longer ranges while still portable. Equally useful for stitching, cauterizing, or even creating wounds when overcharged.    
   
Primary fire: Healing Beam: long range healing beam. Heal over time beam that does less healing per second the further away the target is. HOT tick speed moderately increases the longer the beam is on the target (does not transfer from target to target). Long reload time.   
   
Secondary fire: Discharge: very low damage over time beam. After 1 second of ‚Äúcharging‚Äù beam ‚Äúdischarges‚Äù a moderate sum of instantaneous damage (Like the Charge Rifle from Apex Legends). Shares resource with primary fire.    
   
Ability 1: Tether: Fire a grapple hook at the environment or a teammate.  
When fired at an environment (ex. Roof or wall) you will become tethered to that location until the button is pressed again. While tethered the player can use the space and crouch keys to freely (but slowly) move up and down the tether rope. Player can hang from the ceiling and swing slowly like Hammond. Player can use weapon while hanging, but not Ability 2 (increases recoil with secondary fire while tethered). Tether connection is visible and destructible to the enemy (like a Sym turret). Destroying the tether connection of an enemy Ripcord causes him to fall.  
When fired at a teammate, the teammate will get the message ‚ÄúRipcord is tethered, press F to activate‚Äù. When the activate button is pressed the teammate will be rapidly pulled to Ripcord‚Äôs location. Tether remains ready and attached until used or LOS is broken. Any new stun or displacement attacks on Ripcord OR the teammate will detach the tether.  
  
Ability 2: Portable health pack: Ripcord tosses (like a Torb turret toss) a mini health pack onto the ground that can be used by him or an ally. Health pack is visible to teammates through walls (like hacked packs) and will remain there until it is used or a new pack is placed. Cooldown for pack placement is 2 second. Cooldown for placement after pack is used by a teammate is 8 seconds. Cooldown for placement after pack is used by Ripcord is 4 seconds.    
  
Backstory: Richard (Ripcord) lost the lives of his close friends in a forest fire as a young boy while on a camping trip. Richard also lost his lungs and larynx to the smoke, and was surgically equipped experimental cybernetic lungs to save his life. Richard speaks with a cybernetic speech aid, so his voice sounds harsh and robotic, but that doesn‚Äôt hide his cheery, optimistic attitude. These robotic lungs gives him a superhuman adaptation to altitude and harsh climates. Inspired by his childhood tragedy and his cybernetic enhancements, Richard dedicated his life to wilderness rescue. Now, with the world in turmoil, Richard adopts an alter ego and joins Overwatch as Ripcord.   
   
Image:  
Ripcord is medium in height and lanky in build, like a rock climber. Light ginger, curly hair. He has multifaceted, dynamic metal plating on his chest, neck, and jaw/mouth. Ripcord‚Äôs hands are bare and covered in thick calluses and blisters, with some scraped knuckles. He carries his charge rifle in his right hand which can be fired one handed, but stabilizes with his left when he can. His Charge Rifle looks like a piece of medical machinery inexpertly modified to look somewhat like an SMG, it ain‚Äôt pretty, but it works. He has a grapple mechanism on his left wrist (similar to Widows mine) and a large coil of rope on his left hip. He has a mini health pack on his right hip.   
Ripcord can most iconically be seen repelling from a helicopter, providing first aid with his Charge Rifle before his feet even hit the ground.   
   
  
Ripcord excels at enabling his teammates to make high risk/high reward plays and gaining control of the environment. He has a moderate healing output at close and long range. He is not strong in self defense, especially at close range and he lacks rapid mobility. Trying to escape a fight with tether is so slow that it would be a worse strategy than trying to use Baptiste‚Äôs super jump. It‚Äôs more about positioning than escape.    
I tried to stay away from exact values as that‚Äôs way above my pay grade to balance. But I attempted to give leeway in his abilities to be balanc-able. This hero just popped into my head and his story and personality naturally unraveled as I tried to flesh it out. I‚Äôd love to hear what you guys think!",2020-01-01 17:25:53

Overwatch,2020,1,5 Minute Tips: Improving Movement + Strafing | Grandmaster OW Advice,2020-01-01 18:33:30
Overwatch,2020,1,"Throughout my time playing Overwatch, I've seen so many characters just disregarded because they're ""useless"". People shouting ""but the meta"" despite not playing the meta. Assuming 'x' character is unusable because the pros don't choose them for their specific comp. But there's a whole other world that people seem to completely disregard. 

&amp;#x200B;

Obvious value would be things like dealing good damage, getting kills, saving lives, cancelling ults.

Obscure value, is that which cannot be immediately identified. Those few extra seconds of having a 3rd person on the point, D.Va/Sigma eating abilities and slowing enemy ult econ, Mei walls that keep someone away for that fraction longer. 

&amp;#x200B;

This seasons go-to seems to be D.Va. I haven't had a single issue playing her. In fact, I've been quite successful this season with her. I switch off when they have Zarya, but the almost guarentee of a Rein+Moira combo has really given me a lot of value with her. Both Rein and Moira gain a lot of charge from their Orb and Firestrike, so naturally, playing D.Va is slowing down their ult-gen massively. I think people miss this important part of her right now, and just look at everything through a 'DPS lens' with the exception of a few 'favourite' characters.",2020-01-01 18:37:23

Overwatch,2020,1,"I just got finished with four competitive matches in a row in which I was the only person on my team with a card, please excuse me if I'm a little angsty.

I've been playing more Overwatch than normal this holiday season, including competitive.  Competitive is something I usually avoid since in my experience it tends to produce more toxic interactions than QP, but every now and then I am tempted to give full matches a shot.

Four matches in a row I play support. Four matches in a row we lose. Four matches in a row there is one blue card, it's for me, and it's because I out-performed every other support.

I understand that matchmaking in games is far from perfect. I understand that sometimes no matter how hard you try, you won't win. I also understand that cards aren't necessarily indicative of performance. However, it is substantial evidence towards the assertion that I played better than my teammate and better than the other team's support. Also that my team either didn't counter properly or just had less skill. But if that's the case, the system needs to adjust and group me with those who are also consistently performing. It's extremely demoralizing and discouraging play when I try hard, kick ass, and keep my team alive, but my team still loses, and I \*still\* lose SR points even though I did very well.

Why doesn't the system reward individual players for their performance instead of the entire team taking a hit or getting the boost? I understand Overwatch is a team-oriented game, but most people don't play in pre-made groups. They solo-queue in comp with fingers crossed and hope for the best. However, lately I just feel like the effort I put into keeping the team alive isn't worth it when we all just get shit on by the other team and the SR system anyway.",2020-01-01 19:28:36

Overwatch,2020,1,"I have been playing Overwatch consistently for months now and I have never had a problem with my 1070. However, recently I have been experiencing my GPU ""overheating"" with the fans spinning with what seems to be at their maximum. The reason for all the unsureness is because when I experience this issue it kills my monitor and so I cannot investigate the state of things while it is happening. I have to restart my computer in order to remediate this issue. I am familiar with computers so I was performing standard troubleshooting steps and I saw nothing indicative of an issue is any logs, the GPU heat/performance stats, etc. 

This issue has never appeared in any other game I play or during regular computer usage. 

It does not happen consistently. I haven't noticed any patterns or states that would prime the issue to occur.

I figure it might be a unique issue to me and maybe my 1070 is showing signs of aging but it just happened to my buddy with the exact symptoms.

This is why we created Le Team  Le Team who started as a small group of friends who wanted to just play ranked made us climb rankes day by day. We were lucky to find great people who were not toxic at all, where supportive and worked together as a team. Le Team splitted up a year ago with a lot of us left alone. Once Diamond and higher players now low Plat or even gold.  Now Le Team is back in its final form. Yet now we are very small. Not as big as we were once. So we want to make a server for people that are hard stuck in their ranks, that want to make new friends and climb together as team. Work as a team, win as a team but even Lose as a team. Le Team will give you the chance to make new friends and find yourself your own team. Right now we are a small server with a big dream. But with your help we all can achieve greater heights hand in hand as a fresh and new team.   We welcome everyone from Bronze to even Grandmasters to The Final form of Le Team and wish you will be able to find a team, make friends and most importantly, Climb ranks and get that SR.

Overwatch,2020,1,"Hi, so I opened Overwatch for the first time today since getting my new monitor, keyboard, and mouse, and whenever Overwatch is open, it makes a very weird beeping sound when I press the CTRL, ALT, and SHIFT keys. Only on the left side of my keyboard, though. It makes 5 beeps at first as if something is turning on, then 3 beeps when I press it again. It does it with all the keys, and they all toggle on/off the same thing, it's not individual per key.

Sticky keys/whatever is all turned off, so it's not that. I ended all overlay tasks thinking it was the Radeon software, but it wasnt. I checked volume mixer, and the sound comes out of System Sounds, so it's not from Overwatch itself, but it only happens when Overwatch is open, not any other games.

Ryzen 3600x and Radeon 5700XT, 16gb 3200 ram

After talking about adoption with my roommate for about two months, we figured we would go to a shelter and find a kitten that wants to come home with us for Christmas. Little did we know, the other day this handsome meow showed up at our door scared, shaking, and begging (meowing) for a home.

Sigma walked right into our apartment and immediately made himself comfortable (the second pic of us is taken minutes after he walked in). Since then, he's been following me around the house and watching over me while I'm doing chores. He is super friendly and so gentle, he just loves company and greeting everyone. He is such a love bug and loves any attention he can get. He is a good meow. He must have had a home before but it looks as if he's been outside for a while.

This all feels a bit serendipitous to me. They say that it's the pet who chooses the owner and not the other way around. I don't know who would abandon this sweet guy but I'm lucky he chose me to spoil him with love and treats üòΩ",2020-01-01 22:09:51

https://imgur.com/DzpM0r3

What's more, over the past 2 weeks, I seem to be winning almost every tank game I play and losing almost every DPS game I play.

I've learned how to position myself as Reinhardt well. I hug corners and walls, I swing my hammer from behind a corner while waiting for a full shield before smoothly pushing to the next corner, I track stuns and ults, I call out when I'm pushing and when we need to rest to regenerate shield, I ask for assistance in the form of bubbles and support ults when going aggressive.

When I play DPS, however, I keep dying. There's a certain level of respect and attention that a good main tank commands, in that everyone on the team will listen to what you have to say, that just isn't there when I play my lower ranked DPS. I lose my bearing because I expect the silver main tank on my team to make callouts and tell me when to flank or ult but I just receive radio silence.

Don't take this to mean that I'm blaming my team. I'm not. I understand that I'm a silver DPS because I suck at DPS. I'm just trying to understand why I suck at DPS, and I think part of it is that I expect too much from my teammates because I don't know how to position myself when I play DPS.",2020-01-01 22:36:26

Like, Come ON. I liked this game better when you could actually play the game. And all the cons of the role queue outweigh the cons of just having no role queue.

Now, if I want to play dps, every defeat in competitive is a huge setback. I just don‚Äôt have the time or will to wait a potential half hour just to play a dps, so climbing isn‚Äôt as fun as it used to be. 

And I know you‚Äôll say that the role queue had brought on ensured well balanced teams. But what sold this game to me was the creativity you could have when building a composition.

But now every. single. match. is. the. exact. SAME. It‚Äôs so mundane to play and I get bored within the first five minutes of a game.

Combine that with the still unfixed, broken Hanzo/shield/stun/immortality/bastion meta (i play on console and hanzo just ruins every match unfortunate enough to be graced by his presence), and I can‚Äôt even find a single way to have fun.

It‚Äôs like Blizzard is purposely destroying their game, but then again, I should have expected that from them.

I liked the og overwatch where I wasn‚Äôt forced to play a certain way and I could join a game within a MAX of 5 minutes.

Don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll be coming back. The game is now best enjoyed by people who love being told exactly how to play a game with no leeway at all, and it no longer caters towards those like myself who bought the game on the promise that you could make every match as diverse as you want it to be. Where you could switch between classes and employ actual strategy. Where you could get that occasional team where everyone went support and the game was fun even if you lost but amazing if you won.

Although I will say, it was fun while the good times lasted. See you in the next big hit fps.",2020-01-02 01:36:17

Overwatch,2020,1,"As it stands now the endorsement system is a pointless addition to the game and seems to serve no purpose beyond a little extra xp after a match. Its supposed to foster good behavior from other players but with very little reward and no consequences it just can't do that. 
  I think a few changes to the system would put it more in line for what its objective is supposed to be, first there needs to be consequences to bad behavior within the endorsement system, giving the system numerical values should mean 5 is the best and 1 the worst and you shouldn't want to be a 1, so a deterrent is needed, i think endorsement lvl 1 should be blocked from comp entirely or only allowed a certain number of games per day, lvl 2 allowed a greater number of games per day but still have a cap total amount per day.
  Level 3 and above would be considered the ""positive"" ranks and get the rewards from the system. Keep the lootboxes but get rid of the randomness, set them to a schedule so you know when your good behavior will be rewarded, and as a added incentive to want a positive endorsement level give a certain percentage per endorsement level to get event lootboxes instead of normal ones.
  Last i think adding a visual indicator of someone giving out endorsements, say a check mark appearing above your characters portrait for each one given,would be a good addition to encourage the use of the system since you'd see others participating.",2020-01-02 02:52:45

Overwatch,2020,1,"Shields are designed to stop incoming damage. But its very inconsistent with what is stopped and what isnt. Obviously slow moving things like people are meant to pass through with no problem, while very quick things such as bullets, energy based weapons and beams are meant to be absorbed. But there is a grey area, and I think that grey area is the source of several complaints with specific heroes: Rocket based abilities are inconsistent when it comes to shields. 


Earlier this year, Brig's stun got nerfed in that it would no longer go through barriers. Rein could no longer be stunned out of shield head on, and brig couldnt walk up and bypass the front line and cause chaos without over extending behind enemy shields. This nerf really wrangled back Brig's power levels, and everyone saw this as a welcome change. Her shield bash, along with Pharahs rockets and Junks grenades, are rocket propelled attacks which are stopped by shields. But I cannot grasp why other abilities such as Doomfist's Punch and Rein's Charge aren't stopped by shields, when they're quite literally the same type of attack as Brigs Shield Bash. 


From a practical standpoint it makes sense that shields should be able to distinguish a rocket based attack and stop it from happening. But I'm wondering if it would also make sense from a meta standpoint. Doomfist is one the the most fiercely debated heroes right now, very hard to come up with something that would nerf him without completely killing him. I'm not even sure if stopping doom with shields is too much, that's what I'm hoping to debate. 


I believe this change would make doomfist much more assassin like, he would still be able to utilize superior mobility to navigate a map's side routes and flanks, but he would have to choose his opportunities more carefully. No enemy would shield their rear because it wouldnt make sense to, so it's easy for him to get in and cause chaos, but he wouldnt be able to punch out any way he chooses, he would have to rely on retreating where there are no shields, which makes his movements more predictable and opens him up for counter play. Shields just got nerfed, so they're a very precious commodity right now. Giving them more value by shutting down a couple more abilities means players would certainly give more thought to shield conservation and placement. Just my 2 cents, what do you think?",2020-01-02 03:53:08
Overwatch,2020,1,"Why does Blizzard keep releasing dlc heroes that are super strong and powerful and sometimes essentially must picks? I feel like it started around Doom and Orisa‚Äôs time. Doom had the power to one shot and Orisa was just a better rein that could do more stuff. Then we got Brig who basically did everything. Then Wrecking Ball and his amazing survivability. The weirdest one to me was Sigma who essentially has D.VA‚Äôs defense matrix but gets the added bonus of having shield attached to the damage you take. The seemed like it could have been a good buff the Dva, but they gave it to Sig. It just feels like Blizzard is designing the game without thinking about their OG heroes. Their kit won‚Äôt have the same effect as it did 3 years with the game continuously evolving. Genji stands out to me in need of a major change as he hardly puts out enough damage to outweigh healing, plus damn near every healer in the game counters him in some way.",2020-01-02 03:58:34

My best friend a few years back was dealing with some pretty deep depression issues and as many of us do, play video games to try and help escape the bad things and thoughts we go through. At one point it got bad enough where he felt bullied not only in reality, but online as well.
I'm not sure if that was the turning point or not, but we lost an amazing human because of people just not being kind to one another.

I hopped on to play some casual quick play today and my God did I ever notice so much toxicity today. Everyone was telling each other they play like crap and to get clapped and just anything under the sun to call others out on anything. I couldn't even stick around for more than 4 games because it was starting to get to me, also.

So please, try and be kind to each other. Let's start 2020 off right and all have fun. Cause you never know what the person on the other side of that hero is going through. And a little kindness goes a VERY long way to some people.

Overwatch,2020,1,"We're a few Overwatch enthusiasts who have developed a very early prototype of a lightweight Windows application that will enable you to be notified on Discord (via messages from a Discord-bot) when your game queue ends.

We believe this might be very handy with the long queue times we are experiencing after the introduction of role queue (even though ‚Äúwhile you wait‚Äù has helped in some scenarios). At least this has given us the freedom to roam the house (with the Discord app on our phones) while waiting for the queue to end. This also enable us to not worry about a potential leaver penalty and SR loss.

We‚Äôre already working on a more sophisticated and solid version, so we are eagerly looking for early feedback - feel free to provide it here in this post, on Discord: [https://discord.queuepopper.com/](https://discord.queuepopper.com/) or via Twitter: [https://twitter.com/huggos\_](https://twitter.com/huggos_)

# How to use the tool:

1. Open the application - newest version can be downloaded at [https://queuepopper.com/](https://queuepopper.com/)
2. Press ""Sign in with Google"" and follow the sign up steps
3. Start the ""queue detection process"" and start searching for a game in Overwatch or DOTA2 (stay in-game while searching)
4. Receive a message on Discord (use Discord mobile app) when the queue starts and ends
5. Repeat from step 3 and enjoy the physical freedom while queuing

Overwatch,2020,1,"High silver/low gold tank here.

I mainly play Zarya, but I also play Reinhardt and Orisa if the team is in need of a main tank. The last season before role queue I practically only played tank and support, and ended up in middle to high gold, but this season I've been getting absolutely destroyed by Mei and Reaper, and my winrate is the lowest I think it has ever been, being around 30% with Reinhardt, maybe more around 40% with Zarya. 

Now I know that these two heroes are going to destroy tanks, it's their purpose, I get it. However I can't seem to be able to combat them whatsoever. With Zarya I can save myself and a teammate with my bubbles, and I always try to time them to be just before getting frozen to get the most value out of it and live longer, but by the time I could finish the Mei off she usually already has her cryo freeze ready. With Orisa, although fortify should be her strongest ability against both Mei and Reaper, the damage output and my not-so-on-point aim can't deal with them in the long run. I feel like Reinhardt is the most survivable out of the 3 tanks I like to play, since I can just charge away, however that potentially leaves my team open to enemy fire.

As a tank, with every death I feel like I'm letting my team down pretty heavily, and I feed more than I protect the team, and I do believe that this is partially why I'm losing so many games, yet I still can't figure out a good way to combat these two with my pool of liked heroes. If I'm really desperate and we have a main tank already, I'll switch to Winston so I can survive longer by jumping away and trying to pick off the enemy support, but without a main tank, Winston's shield is not the best option for the only shield in the team.

Overwatch,2020,1,"Hi everyone, wondering if anyone can help with this weird thing that‚Äôs bothering me in Overwatch. I played with the colorblind settings and changed the team and enemy UIs, just for something new, but when I get an elimination the skull icon is still in default red. I‚Äôve seen player replays (live gameplay AND career profile replays) where the skull icon matches enemy team colors, so I can‚Äôt figure out how to make this adjustment, or why it hasn‚Äôt happened automatically. Skull colour matches enemy colour (currently pink) in arcade stuff even, but not in quick play or competitive.

Can anyone help me to get the elim skulls to match enemy colour?

Also, I apologize to colourblind players who might be reading this because I‚Äôve learned through the skull thing that colourblind solutions for OW players aren‚Äôt ideal and I‚Äôm just doing this for fun, but I feel you colourblind players! I sympathize!

Thanks everyone.",2020-01-02 15:32:47

Overwatch,2020,1,"Hey, gamer friends. So, I'm a woman. I game. I've been gaming for many, many years. I'm used to the bullshit that comes with being a girl gamer. It's just part of gaming culture, sadly. It's not so bad in the Overwatch community, thankfully, because it has a high rate of girl gamers. 

Last night, though, I was accosted so badly over comms, that for the first time, I shut the game off and walked away shaking and in tears. I was told that I should go kill myself, that my husband should beat the shit out of my children and I, that my children should be killed before they are old enough to be ""retards in society."" Throw in some insults about how I sound really fat and am too fat too carry. Oh, there was even an anti-semetic joke or three thrown in there for whatever reason. He was literally screaming at the top of his lungs the whole time, before I finally decided to be bullied off comms. This was all because I chose a hero that they wanted their friend to have. 

Of course, I reported him. But then I got mad thinking about how nothing will probably come of it. That this dude will probably get to continue to play this game and scream at other women in the same, abusive way. And that the women who play OW will just continue to endure it quietly because that's what we have to do to play the games we bought.

It got me thinking about what are the consequences when you are reported? What happens? Are you banned? Do you get locked out of your account? Are you muted? Do you get warned first? Are there different tiers of offenses that are treated differently than the normal, ""This guy was telling us all to get fucked because we lost our comp game?"" or ""This dude left our comp game and we lost because he was salty?""

Also, thank you to all the gamers out there who aren't complete assholes to us women who decide to game in our freetime. I just had a baby two months ago, and getting to play OW is a rare occurrence for me now. I appreciate it when I do have a chance to sneak on and can play with friendly, non-toxic people.",2020-01-02 15:49:51

Overwatch,2020,1,"Hello,

can someone please explain me how new RQ MM working?
Played since day one, mainly support, then tank, and lastly as dps.
99.9% of time I play solo.


Before RQ my highest SR was mid diamond (~3300), climbed from gold (starting from S2).


Since RQ got live, my HIGHEST calibration SR as support is ALWAYS mid gold (despite season high was plat).
Tank is low gold.
And DPS is... plat (highest of all).


Really, I don't get it, this have no sense to me. it might seem like I'm showing off, but i'm not.
I really dont like to play as DPS, I play as DPS much less often than support or tank, but OW decides that i'm a better DPS player than support or tank.


Will smurfing helps me (i'm not going to destroy someones games)? Or what else can I do? I'm feeling very frustrated and lost my will to play comp for ever.",2020-01-02 16:35:18

Now this season for me playing in Gold/Plat and Diamond (Tank, Support and Dps) is that the Mei/Reaper show has been in full effect and more into Diamond it is Mei/Hanzo. 

This is also clear with the tanks and healers, with Baptiste being a pretty much autopick healer and really so is Sigma.

Why does it take a game that has got such a decent team, loads of players who produce loads of data such a huge amount of time to correct problems and balance the game? 

Why do we wait months for corrections when people are buying this game?

I was playing a game last night and this Moira i one clipped her during our 1 v 1 and apparently she got pissed. i was shooting at her from far away then she followed me and i ran away far enough because i know she will not abandon the payload just to kill one tracer because we will win the objective if she left but if she stayed her team will arrive on time possible delay us more but what she is was very unpredictable she followed me very far and killed me but we got the payload to the second point.

&amp;#x200B;

this is one example. sometimes i run into enemies where they are off position where they shouldn't be and my team should have killed them long time ago but unlucky me i run into them and i die as tracer when i am low on health and don't have recall.

&amp;#x200B;

Sometimes i win games like this but sometimes i lose because of someone who is unpredictable and so bad but ends up killing me  on a critical moment they just get lucky to have a smurf on their team which ends up killing half of my team and i am the only who who can stop him.

Firstly, and most important, **you CANNOT be a minor in your location and participate in Overwasted.** You are not required to drink, but you are required to be of age. If any suspicion arises about this, it will be looked into.

Secondly, Overwasted is a mini event on my own community discord [here](https://www.discord.io/DoesBoKnow). **Please feel free to mute the rest of the server if you aren't interested in the other content.** You'll find the #dbk-overwasted channel and that's where we'll be. This is intended to be a way to interact with my Discord/Twitch community, but I wanted to see if anyone here was interested.

Thirdly, some details:

* The event will start at 8PM Central Standard Time on Friday, January 10th. We do understand this isn't accommodating to other time zones, but from experience we've noticed that trying to continue the event past a North American night wasn't as fruitful as it seemed.
* The primary platform with be PC. That's where my friends and I will be playing. We likely won't create special voice channels specifically for console players participating.
* Mods or myself reserve every right to remove you from the channel, or the server, for behavior.
* I will be streaming this event [on my Twitch channel](https://www.twitch.tv/DoesBoKnow). Keep this in mind for potential privacy's sake.

Finally, this event is intended for us to **have fun**. We're likely to lose more games than win due to our state, but if we get enough people we can get some custom games going too. If you create a hostile environment for players you're grouping up with, do not be surprised if you're removed.",2020-01-02 21:17:25

Overwatch,2020,1,"running a factory. have a problem. one box contains 3 of two items to ship.

item 1 is on short demand, item 2 is very high on demand. item 3 is 2nd on demand. however, to ship one box i have to stall time because i have to wait for item 1 to arrive to complete a box for sales.

therefore the production is very slow and those that want item 2 have to wait 10 mins for it.

those that want item 1 dont have to wait at all, infact its only 30seconds.

Should i just leave it as it so production slows down

or should i just make it only 1 item 1 3 item 2 and 2 item 2. so production speeds up ????

&amp;#x200B;

instead i am very stubborn on making 2 item 1 and 2 item 2 and 2 item 3 when no one wants item 1.

is it my fault or the demands fault ?

i should serve the people right because consumers always right and if it is high on demand then the company should adapt to it right ??

so i am failing to see the resolution of the problem and refuse to adapt and be very stubborn on 2-2-2

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

now lets apply this problem to overwatch.

if dps is HOT and is on high demands. and the q time is 10 mins because they are waiting for tank players to come to start a game.

instead of waiting for 2 tanks. just wait for 1.

and instead of serving 2 dps, just serve 3.

and yes 1tank -3 dps. 2 support has been meta in pro play before.

&amp;#x200B;

how much dps q time will this fix ???

literally 90 percent.

by ADAPTING to the demands, role q with 1-3-2

will make it 10 second wait for tanks. 30 seconds wait for dps. 20 second wait for suppport.

because it only takes one tank for a new game to start. THEREFORE , production is FAST.

customers is always right.. if DPS is on high demands then SERVE IT.",2020-01-02 21:46:49

So upon searching from keywords related to 'Outline', most recent results were regarding friendly player outlines, couldn't seem to find anything regarding this issue, but lately I've noticed while playing that the outlines of players, whether they're an enemy or if they're friendly, seem to disappear when they're standing **in front** of the cart.

I'm pretty sure this was never the case before and that we were still able to see player outlines when an enemy is in front of the cart, no? Is this something that's happening only on my end due to certain setting configurations? Or is it just that no one has actually noticed this? Or am I just being crazy and that this has always been the case since the very beginning?

Overwatch,2020,1,"I really need help to not tilt.

I‚Äôve been playing overwatch since the closed beta on and off, but mostly off. For a bit of background, my career high was high gold and I just finished S19 at high silver. This isn‚Äôt so much about ranked as it is with the game in general. I have fun with it, and I really want to improve. Mainly I want to play with my girlfriend since it‚Äôs pretty much her exclusive game. I love playing with her, but I get no fun to play with when I tilt, as I‚Äôm sure most people who tilt are. I don‚Äôt harass my team or throw, but I do get visibly frustrated and my gameplay takes a nose dive. 

It‚Äôs not even in comp, just in general when things go south I tend to tilt. I‚Äôm not proud of it and I get embarrassed, but it‚Äôs honestly my first instinct and it just winds up with me playing something else for the rest of the night while she climbs without me. 

I practice in quickplay, I try to have an attitude of positivity or not caring about the outcome, or even tell myself I‚Äôm bad and not to expect much. But when I feel like the team isn‚Äôt cooperating properly or I just don‚Äôt perform to my expectations, I start getting angry and need to break for the night.

So does anyone have any advice for avoiding getting too frustrated in the moment? Should I just get drunk before I play until I desensitize myself to the situations that tilt me?",2020-01-03 01:32:14

Even tho they were inactive, they would always vote for Reinheart in the end of the game (i saw the counts go up to 4)... It has been going on for the last 3 games and i can't take on the whole team so i left.

Overwatch,2020,1,"So I just played my placements and an extra game for a total of 6 games just for the healers. I lost 2 of them and won 4 of them. According to my stats though, I lost 4 and won 4. I lagged out of 2 of the games, but I ended up winning 1 and losing the other. It seems if I leave the game, the statistics mark me down as losing that game, even though I get back before the 1:30 timer is up. So if I win a game and lag out, I get a tally for a win and a loss, but if I lose a game due to lag reasons, I get a tally for 2 losses. Has anyone encountered this problem?

Overwatch,2020,1,"Last competitive season introduced map rotation. At the time it appeared as though some maps were excluded from competing play for balancing issues, possibly due to be reworked. With season 20, we now can confirm that maps are being excluded with no rhyme or reason. 

I‚Äôve brought this up with groups in-game and found the consensus alarming. Everyone would simply point to other games doing the same thing as justification. I however don‚Äôt believe that a bad idea is justified simply because competitors are doing it. 

I have some 4,000+ hours invested in Overwatch and can count on one hand the amount of times my teammates complained about the randomly selected map being  Lijiang Tower.  Removing locations that have been with the game for nearly four years makes one inclined to not play competitive. No business attracts more costumers by removing features, and that‚Äôs essentially what Blizzard has done. You wouldn‚Äôt go to Chick-fil-A because they got rid of your favorite meal. 

Map rotation reeks of desperation. It‚Äôs yet another change introduced not to improve the game, but to simply have something for bloggers and news sites talk about it.

Most commonly, it's a Zarya/Roadhog combination. Those tanks never communicate, and they play as DPS (running flanks, chasing after enemy squishies, not occupying space or escorting payload/holding the point).

It's annoying, but of course you can only control what you play and not others. When playing DPS, I maximise use of cover and play less aggressively as there's less safe space to push into.

Overwatch,2020,1,"**PREFACE:** This may be more of a niche improvement, but if you are anything like me, you enjoy playing Mystery Heroes. I think it is fun, and it forces me to learn many of the characters I am not quite so good at that I would be unlikely to choose in an actual game.

Simply put, the issue at hand is that when you play Mystery Heroes, you are at the hand of RNG. Sometimes you get lots of healers and no tanks. Sometimes all tanks and one dps. Or Some variation of the mix. Obviously though, that literally is what Mystery Heroes is meant to be.

**MY SUGGESTION:** In the spirit of Blizzard pushing 2-2-2, I would like to see a system put in place where it DOES NOT force 2-2-2 in Mystery Heroes, but STRONGLY ENCOURAGES it.

*For example, there would be a 33% greater chance when you die that the next hero you play will be that of the missing role.*

I have not experimented with different inputs and values, but I am curious what thoughts you all have on something like this. Also, the same would apply if you have too many of a single type, where it becomes less likely you will get the role, while not guaranteeing you won't. I really have no idea how Blizzard currently sets up Mystery Heroes, but I imagine it's worth talking about.  


Edit: An idea I like, as suggested by IzzInks, a soft, hidden 1-1-1 might be a better idea. That way no matter what, there's always at least one healer, one tank, one dps, while still being in favour of being random/mystery. 

**WHILE WE'RE ON THE SUBJECT:** Not immediately related, but since we're already here, what's the deal with Mystery Heroes only offering a small selection of heroes to play per game? Clearly it's not truly mystery, because you will often re-roll the same exact character several times, while other characters won't show up at all. Is there a reason it's not open up to play any of the 21 characters for any single game? If Blizzard were to implement my former suggestion, I would also suggest making all characters available to be played rather than what feels like less than half of them per game.

Thoughts? Good idea? Bad? Let me know what you think! Thanks for reading.",2020-01-03 20:55:39

* Lonewolf
* Refuses to switch
* Refuses to combo ults
* No response in text/voice
* Never has gold elims/damage
* Doesn't group up/trickles

Obviously this puts us at a 5-6 disadvantage almost every teamfight. Out of every game I've played so far this season, this has been the case, and it's something that's been happening in previous seasons too.

So far this season, my stack of tanks and supports are *always* the last ones alive in a teamfight, but facing up a 4v6 all the time doesn't get us anywhere without a great amount of luck. We feel like we're being held down so hard by DPS that are refusing to cooperate, and I get the impression that the other team always stacks with DPS, and communicates correctly. I don't think this is a case of the enemy being any better or worse than us, but just our solo-stacking DPS constantly refusing to play.

I just don't know what more we can do when we run a high-mobility comp, only for the solo-DPS to choose Bastion (Happened twice so far this season). That puts us in a position of just letting the Bastion handle himself (and die) or completely switch up out comp to be more Bunker, which really isn't what we're too good with.

Before I do any reporting; is picking one character, refusing to switch when being countered and asked by the team, refusing communication, and lone-wolfing it a reportable offence? 

I watch all my matches back between our 'chill-out' breaks before concidering to report, heat-of-the-moment isn't the best time to be reporting anyone.",2020-01-04 00:39:10

Overwatch,2020,1,"I just opened Overwatch after not playing in a while.  Had four loot boxes waiting to be opened.  Played a game as a tank, and was rewarded another loot box.

I then opened all five loot boxes.  All twenty rewards were duplicates, with the exception of one reward, which was gold.  But everything else, all common and rare items that I already had.

Annoyed, I took a look at the hero gallery.  I filtered for items that are available currently (so, only 'Overwatch', ie Regular items, not holiday or anniversary events, and no OWL skins), and filtered for just rare and legendary items.  I have a total of 239 unearned rare and legendary items.  Why, in five boxes, can't I get a single one of 239 items that I don't have?  Why do they all have to be duplicate items where I get a small percentage of the credits that those items are worth?

Can I only get rare or legendary items if I pay for loot boxes?",2020-01-04 02:00:58

Overwatch,2020,1,I think Brig needs a way stun without her sheild. Shes the only character where taking away her barrier eliminates another ability. Especially with her barrier at 200hp now she blocks a couple shots and then cant use stun. If Rein barrier goes down he can still charge and throw flamestrike. If orisa's goes down she can still use fortify but destroying bright's sheild is like a mini sombra hack where all shes left with is whip shot. I have found this very broken as I've played her more and more. Proper sheild management can help a lot but with just 200hp that's going to be though.,2020-01-04 05:15:38

Overwatch,2020,1,"I may be wrong to say this but I have an inmate dislike for people who derank on Alt accounts or even those who use more than one competitive account at a time. Let me explain.

For people who derank on Alt accounts in competitive: imagine being new to the game and being put into bronze, you‚Äôre trying your best to do what you can and maybe you need to learn your hero better a little bit but you just can‚Äôt seem to get to silver. I can only imagine the frustration when a normally plat (or higher) Hanzo main joins the game on the enemy team and your entire team gets shut down because of it. It‚Äôs frustrating and is really bad for people who just want to learn and get better at the game. But the big kicker: THIS PREVENTS PEOPLE FROM ENJOYING THE GAME. This ruins fun for the low tier players and is why they don‚Äôt play it much and even encourage new people not to play the game. 

For people who use second accounts on competitive: I get it you‚Äôre comp point hungry, but do you really need to be acknowledged that much? I find this especially bad for people that are trying to rank up. Why is it so hard to rank to the top? Obviously it requires a lot of game time played, which not many people have, but even then the top spots seem to be taken up by people who have multiple accounts. I feel like I‚Äôve seen on many occasions in players that are in the top 500, it‚Äôs not so much to them about how high they are ranked in T500 but more so about how many accounts they can have that are in T500, this pushes people down to lower tiers and basically tells the top players that if they want to buy multiple accounts and have them sit at GM while others are trying to grind up through diamond or masters, that‚Äôs completely fine.

Basically, I feel like competitive would be actually more competitive if you got rid of Alternate accounts altogether. I‚Äôm not sure how this would be implemented but if it could be, I‚Äôm sure it would fix so many issues that exist in comp games.",2020-01-04 10:09:14

The fact is that surely if an account has placed into Masters and above it didn't get there by accident, the person either had someone playing their account for them or they are good and climbed/placed into that rank.

Now the easy bit.... how the hell does someone sit at high masters and then wind up playing in Gold/Platinum games? Surely Blizzard should be able to see that an account which is  well 3700 should not be able to play in Gold/Plat territority?

I can only imagine it is the same for the T500 that end up in Masters games, they shouldn't be in that rank playing games.

Overwatch,2020,1,"I was just browsing the EU shop of Blizzard again and have noticed the price for those statues has gone up (again) significantly recently.

Originally when blizzard was only shipping them from the US, I remember I paid 150 dollars for the Reaper and Tracer statue. After a while, they finally opened the EU shop and the prices where the same in Euro's (which is already more expensive). After some more time, they raised the prices for EU towards 175 EUR.

Today I checked the website again, all the 'normal size' statues are raised to 215 EUR's a piece, Doomfist is 330 EURs now from 300 before, and [D.VA](https://D.VA) is 530 EUR's now, coming from 450 originally..

How can blizzard justify making them more and more expensive? They only have production costs, they should be going down in price..

Furthermore is both the statue of Mei and Lucio not available on the EU store.

Anyone sharing the frustration in all of this? The region locked statues, the absurd pricing compared to the already expensive starting prices?",2020-01-04 15:07:16

Overwatch,2020,1,"I've been playing competitive since season 1 and after being in Diamond for a few months finally managed to hit Master in season 3 by mainly playing tank. Over the next few seasons I played more support and some damage but could keep my rank at around low Master until season 8.

Whenever I picked a damage hero I quickly realized that I'm just not good enough for the rank I'm in and began falling to low Diamond. 

It's still like this for me; I usually get 1 kill every 2 deaths and only do better if my team is really good and basically carrying me to a victory. So here I am hardstuck in low Diamond even though I'd consider myself a Gold damage player at best. 

I really thought role queue would fix this issue but after the beta my rank in all 3 roles was practically the same as the season before, season 17.

Looks like Echo's kit meshed well with this gun and perhaps this could give us a good insight for when Echo (eventually) becomes a hero.

Recently however we've been getting more and more abuse for not being in voice with the rest of the team, we won't be asked to join but we start losing and people start to blame us for not being in voice as the reason for us losing, and when we go into voice the abuse is so great that we just feel like giving up after one or two games sometimes. It's now gotten to the point where we're both considering never going into voice at all because at least then it's only text chat and not people yelling into our ears half the game. Basically what I'm asking is whether or not we should just suck it up and go in to feel terrible and maybe have a better chance at winning, or whether we should just do our own thing and try to have fun.",2020-01-04 19:09:43

It literally just becomes a skills matchup where I have to use my limited dps to out skill an actual dps that can kill me with less effort. Having to peel for myself even when I'm with my team has become a nightmare. I feel like a helpless pray animal at times. 

As a tank I can absorb way more damage. In the case of snipers if I get hit I usually have enough time to reposition. Also, Hog and Hammond are fat dps' that, if uncontested, can be just as effective as any dps it seems. There are other tanks that have awesome abilities that make self peeling much easier too.

Overwatch,2020,1,"So about 2 years ago I used be be grand Master mercy on console. Comp was toxic back then, and work consumed my life, so I stopped playing comp. Additionally, the use of mouse and keyboard was beginning to take over console, and I couldn't live for what seemed longer than 30 a match. 
I've been back playing overwatch for about 3 months now, did my placement matches, and got ranked 2180, almost 2000 less than my all time high! I had gold healing each match, as well as other gold medals depending on the match type and character played. Had gold damage on the majority of matches. I'm just confused as to why I ranked so low? Not only so low, but lowest I have ever been! Is there something I missed during the period of me not playing besides the class separation?",2020-01-04 22:39:03

No idea why they would make it like a different day thing, maybe to encourage people to play more, because hey you if you lose... surely you are on for a win soon? But just when you been winning enough suddenly... nobody is in voice chat... you got these one tricks who refuse to switch. At your most pivitol game you get given your worst team, its like you would take **Any** team you have been with previously over these guys for your Rank up or Season high game.

I was listening to a streamer talk about it with his 4300SR account and he was just saying 'Well the other team is stacked, this will be a loss, but the SR for this account is too high so it wants it to go back down'.

When streamers who are GM are predicting their losses from spawn.... well you know this game isn't honest with how it matches teams.

I'm not some silver/plat level average player. I've hit GM on every single role and haven't placed below Masters ever (rank 70 in S1). These aren't suspicious snaps that I'm talking about. It's enemy DPS using wallhacks where they randomly scope in on an area I am going to without any reason to suspect I would be heading there and without sonar/widowmaker ult. Most of these cheaters have awful positioning and use ultimates incorrectly but are rocking a 60% scoped crit accuracy. They make it to high masters before their cheats aren't enough to push them to GM, but it still makes the game not enjoyable. 

The main reason I used to play Overwatch is because it was cheater free. I play TPP in PUBG and it's littered with cheaters. Blizzard used to have such a strong anti-cheat for this game. I don't know if it's lack of staffing during holidays, but it's gotten out of hand.",2020-01-05 06:05:04

Overwatch,2020,1,"It's quite obvious and I bet even more obvious to Blizzard internally who is on a smurf account. Let's be real; if you are a sub-level100 account in Masters+, this isn't your first account.

If a system was implemented that forced smurf mirroring - i.e. a smurf would have to be matched against a smurf in the same role in any given competitive game - we'd fix the issue.

1) Smurfs would get longer queue times, discouraging the practice.

2) Smurfs wouldn't get free reign to stomp games, as there would be an opposing smurf in the same role to counteract them.

I used to not care too much about smurfing but it just really, REALLY is a problem. These past few days, *every single match* has been decided by who has more smurfs. 

**It's just not fun.**

Look, I get that people ""having alts"" is supposed to be a legitimate thing and that they ""get placed appropriately"" but we know that's absolutely not true. There is no such thing as placing GM on a new account. Therefore by nature every single GM player who makes an alt is smurfing.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To be honest, I'm a little apprehensive posting something like this on here, but I feel like it needs to be done. On this post, I will be discussing an issue I currently have with Hanzo, and what I see when I watch high level players play. Discussion isn't limited on just Hanzo, either; you could also talk about how Genji needs balancing or whatever needs balancing. **This a base for respectful discussion and debate; not all people have to agree with your opinion.** So please, don't be a dick.

Hanzo is great at a lot of things.

Yes, he should have decent mobility like wall climb, but not an ability that allows him to escape death every five seconds. I believe that if someone closes the distance on Hanzo (like Doomfist, Tracer, Winston, etc.), then Hanzo either dies or gives up that ground or gets a skillful flick on their head to kill them. The Doomfist, Tracer, or Winston shouldn't have half their health taken away, while the Hanzo gets away with free ult charge and little to no damage done to him. Maybe he deals half the Winston's health with a fully charged arrow, but he takes a significant amount of damage while escaping? A trade-off, if you will.

If an enemy gets close to Hanzo, then he should suffer the consequences. I'm not saying that Hanzo should die every time a flanker gets close, but what I am saying is he shouldn't be able to avoid them with such incredible ***ease***\*\*.\*\*

Storm arrow is also a really big problem when it comes to something like this.

I believe that, as a sniper, Hanzo should be good at dealing damage at long and medium ranges. Not only is he good at dealing incredible damage at medium to long ranges, but he can deal seventy damage per shot up close with storm arrow and can deal even more than that if he gets a head shot.

I also believe that Hanzo should be limited to his capabilities of one shotting squishies, since he sometimes doesn't even need to use storm arrow to dismantle someone that is close to him. Just an arrow that doesn't even need to be fully charged can easily deal enough damage with a head shot to scare off an enemy flanker.

So Hanzo has insane survivability, has fantastic short, medium, and long range capabilities, and his only weakness is...what? I can't find one. Health, maybe?

So, what do we do about this? Well, here's a list:

1. To allow squishies to not feel as oppressed by Hanzo, we lower his fully charged arrow rate from every 0.75 seconds, to every 1 second. This gives squishies time to react and to adjust against him, but still allows Hanzo to take full advantage of the ability to prep. a fully charged arrow behind a wall, climb up the wall, and shoot the fully charged arrow.
2. We can try not allowing his arrows that are not fully charged to head shot. Fully charged arrows do the same damage on a body shot and a head shot, but arrows that are just barely not full charge don't instantly kill a squishy. This allows for more counter-play options like Tracer and Doomfist that enjoy getting in Hanzo's face but can't quite follow up, because the Hanzo scares them off with a head shot that wasn't fully charged.
3. The arrows storm arrow should be reduced from six, to three or four. The damage should be reduced from seventy to forty or forty-five, and this ability should not be able to head shot. The ability could then have a seven or six second cool down. This sounds harsh, but bear with me. I believe Hanzo's damage should stay the same: 125 body shot fully charged arrow and over 300 upon head shot. But, if he's going to be good at medium to long range, then his short range should be useless. I believe storm arrow should be used as a finisher, like Widow's sub-machine gun. Maybe you've got this Mccree at one health, and you just can't connect that last arrow. Well, storm arrows has your back, but you have to be precise; you don't have that many arrows.
4. Erase lunge all together, or increase cool down to seven seconds to increase counter-play. This nerf would force Hanzo to play more passively and with the team if there are counters on the enemy team. And if one of his counters is in his face, then he can only use lunge once in that 1v1 instead of twice.
5. Remember, it doesn't have to be all of these; it could only require one or two (or all if you'd prefer).

Again, **this is not a rant** but merely ideas that I would like for people to see, consider, discuss, criticize, add to, and debate. The current patch we have is great, but now we need to discuss and debate what we can do in this current state of the game so we can improve the game's balance even further.",2020-01-05 10:11:42

Overwatch,2021,1,"Hi, I had a problem with my game install. My PC is perfectly capable of running the game, but for some reason the game was running extremely slow when it had just launched. It would be fine after a couple minutes, until a new asset was loaded in, like a hero using its abilities, then it would tank down to 2 - 10 fps. I found a solution but it wasn't that well documented. So I wanted to make a post here to possibly help some people out.

The reason why the game is running so slow is because the shader cache is faulty. The solution is to delete this cache so it can be rebuild. You can follow the following steps to do this:

1. Exit Overwatch
2. You need to locate your NV\_Cache folder. For me this was located in \`C:\\ProgramData\\NVIDIA Corporation\\\`. If you have trouble finding yours, you can try a program like \`Everything\` or even Windows Search to find the folder for you. After I deleted this folder the game started and was running like new.
3. Some people suggested disabling that caching feature, I would not recommend this because this will increase CPU load. If you really want to disable this, it is done in the Nvidia control panel under 3D-Settings.",2021-01-01 14:13:50

So of course we got thumped first round, and then someone left. We clearly weren't gonna win 5v6 with one of our 5 possibly only playing tank for priority pass. So, once the timer was up, I decided to leave - we were gonna lose anyway and I didn't fancy being camped at spawn all game, since that was how it was going. 

I joined another game straight after, where it was close but we won. I gained 3 SR for the win. I know it isn't because of my rank, as I'm about 200sr from my season/career high atm, so it can't be because I'm in a rank too high for my skill level.

Overwatch,2021,1,"I've been playing for around 3 years. Low Gold SR

When i play, I either play: Comp, QP or Mystery Hero's.

&amp;#x200B;

**Competitive Ladder:** 

* In comp, we either roll the opponents, or get rolled ourselves. It is around 1 in 10 games it is actually competitive. 
* When we do call outs in voice, there are usually 4-5 join, and nobody talks. 
* We have a lot of people who do not speak English on the EU ladder. I am not saying that people have to speak English, but to have a competitive 6v6 TEAM BASED shooter, it is hard to be a team if you cannot communicate with each other.
* I was bronze, and got up to low gold.

&amp;#x200B;

**Quick Play:**

* I think it is due to my ELO, but all i get in my games are level 1's through to level 60's. i have over 400hrs in the game, so playing with people who do not even know what the abilities do is very frustrating. It seems that it is luck of the draw as to who gets the new players, and that determines the outcome. I know smurfs exist, but they are not common.
* Maps - I do not know why Paris and HLC are still in the map rotation for QP, what are you meant to learn playing maps that are not in the comp rotation? they have been taken out for a reason.

&amp;#x200B;

**Mystery Hero's:**

* Impossible to play on Defense. Its rough playing against a team who are snow balling ults, and you have to reset your ults every time you die. Like saving ults for a big recontest is part of defending, it is not possible in mystery hero's. 

&amp;#x200B;

Can anyone suggest how i can change my mindset to make this game fun again? everything to me seems pointless, frustrating or impossible. I hate playing, but come back every day to play. I know this is addictive behavior. I am going to take a break in the new year.

Overwatch,2021,1,"Okay so first off this post was made because I realised as I watched the Ov2 trailor that Junkrat, Roadhog nor the Junker Queen were in it. I didn‚Äôt see any refs, mentions etc or hints at the place. 

And I realise that other characters in Overwatch were not mentioned but I‚Äôm gonna focus on these guys for now. 

Disclaimer: I am also aware that they probably won‚Äôt have a story arc or will particularly be involved in the second game. But this is based off of IF statements. As well as the fact that it‚Äôs been confirmed that all characters from Overwatch 1 will carry on to 2. 

Anyway. 

I have a little theory that the reason they were not shown at all, is because they may have re-designs to do with their story mode/arc, assuming they‚Äôll have one. Because they weren‚Äôt involved with the Talon or Overwatch in the first game.

So I think and this is a wild shot in the dark here but I‚Äôd like to hear what you guys think, is that their arc in the story mode/ in the game could be 2 things.

1.) Be based around their own comical adventures in Junkertown. Possibly involving the queen who could then be unlocked as one of the new characters. Building upon both characters pasts and what Junkrat‚Äôs treasure actually is.

2.) Them finally joining Overwatch or Talon. I don‚Äôt know how, but maybe they are recruited because Overwatch needs a specific job for them or because they need Junkrats treasure/abilities as well as Roadhog. (For some reason I get the hunch they wouldn‚Äôt join the Talon unless they promised to keep the Junkers away from the authorities.)

I know the most likely thing is Overwatch 2 wasn‚Äôt fully developed when they released the trailor and so a bunch of characters weren‚Äôt even bothered with. But still. Imma have fun theorising.

What do you think they‚Äôll be like in Overwatch 2?",2021-01-01 21:47:54

Overwatch,2021,1,"Lily is a time traveller from the late 2010s to early 2020s who is from a version of our universe, owning a copy of Overwatch. She sometimes play it, confusing most characters. She is physically 5 years younger than D.Va. (Born in 2006, travelled from 2020, making her 69 without the travel)

Home Stage: Hong Kong, and it‚Äôs Blast to the Past version

Role: Tank (actually she‚Äôs able to fill in all three roles, Tank is due to health)

Health: 400

Primary Fire: Dual Glock

Secondary Fire: Heal Ray (uses artificial souls made by a Golemancer friend from before she time travelled)

Melee: Piston Kick (Kicks enemy upwards then forwards)

Ability 1: Freeze! (Lily can give her primary and melee the Freezing property)

Ability 2: I don‚Äôt trust Shields (Lily weakens all enemy shields)

Ultimate: Ice Stun (Punches the ground, causing ice to spread using her punch as a point of origin, freezes enemies)

She also has an emote where she plays her copy of the game, which can trigger responses from teammates

She interacts with everyone quite well, and owing the game means that she knows everyone‚Äôs real name (including Sombra)

She also has a bad experience with people which works well with Overwatch‚Äôs tearjerking character backstories but I‚Äôm not putting it here",2021-01-02 05:05:13

Overwatch,2021,1,"I don‚Äôt know about you guys but some heroes really need a buff that make them useable in certain situations. First thing is Genji, I don‚Äôt know why but I feel like he‚Äôs super weak in terms of health while using Ult. Not only you‚Äôre a big target now since using ultimate but also can be stoppable by any ability you think about. Giving Genji Damage received reduction just like mercy would really make sense since Genji will always be at risk being IN the enemy line while using Ult. 
Zenyatta, this hero literally needs a buff in primary fire rate. Like zen going against tracer and Genji is super hard because of how zen is a bit slow and has less dps with his Primary fire rate.
Ana, looking at how Ana cannot scope while jumping makes me real sad since it makes her a hero with less agility. Maybe even increase her ADS to make her more fun and deal more healing over time. No scoping can still be viable but a scope can always be better when she‚Äôs back.",2021-01-02 06:08:24

Overwatch,2021,1,"Basically, I would like to see some of Zarya's old weapon properties return (increased beam width and ball size the higher her charge goes up) in exchange for movement nerfs.

For her laser beam:  The higher charge Zarya is, the slower her movement speed is...but only when she is firing. 

For her alt-fire orbs: I envision her having some kind of recoil that increases the higher her charge is.

So is this something that is within the ability of the Workshop tools?  

Obviously this is mainly for fun and I would play with the numbers,  but I am also really curious how my vision of Zarya would play out.

Overwatch,2021,1,"Greetings everyone,
 

I am reaching out due to a quirk that I have been experiencing while trying to play on my new computer. If I try to launch the game with dual monitors, FPS will tank to 10~20. If I disconnect the hdmi to the second monitor, launch overwatch, and then reconnect it, it works just fine. I also noticed that target monitor only appears when I do the steps above and fails to recognize that there are two monitors. Otherwise, the target monitor selection doesn't appear at all. Has anyone else experienced this issue before and found a remedy for it? It's not game-breaking, but it is a real hassle doing this each time that I want to play the game. Thanks in advance!

As it stands, especially in low elo where smurfing is rampant, Hammond is the character with the greatest impact and least counterplay. If you cc him with hog, ana or anything of the sorts, there is so little counterplay vs his high healthpool and incredible mobility that 9 times out of 10 he escapes and continues a vicious cycle.

I know medals aren't the be all end all, but it shows I wasn't just dying on cool down. Taking out the Bastion, contesting the other dps, trying not to waste my Ulti. Like, I feel I'm playing alright. Make some questionable calls, same as everyone else.

Does it just give more for winning on the other roles? I know it's really complex and almost nobody understands it 100%, but I just thought it was kinda weird.

Overwatch,2021,1,"diamond support + plat dps here. ive been playing ow for two seasons and i try my best to find heros that match my playstyle in comp. i tend to play very aggressive and enjoy close range style. 

for support, i play brig, zen, ana, moira and mercy. i started playing bap but not really in comp yet. i don‚Äôt find any support hero difficult but ana prob is the one that requires full attention. (srs sometimes my hand hurts) 


recently, i started playing dps playing cree, ash, solider. most hitscan heros i can pick up. i was able to reach plat no problem but i would like to play other heroes as well. 


for some reason, i find projectile dps hero very difficult to play such as doomfist, genji, pharah, hanzo and echo. so people who main these heroes, how do you guys play them? what are some tips? 

who do you guys think is the hardest hero on ow? and why? 

personally i think it‚Äôs doomfist and genji. doom is just so .. weird. i wish i could play him well. also echo and pharah.. ugh i can‚Äôt freaking stay in the sky! why! i can‚Äôt play pharah being grounded...",2021-01-02 23:27:24

I am guessing that 4 years ago, gold elo consisted of a much different skill level than nowadays. For whatever reason, my elo carried over like 20 seasons, 4 years ahead despite not playing almost at all during that time. How did this happen??",2021-01-02 23:56:36
Overwatch,2021,1,"So there's clearly problems with the game mode:  
1. Achievements are unachievable without cheating.  
2. Puppy guarding is the most reliable strategy.  
3. Mercy has an unfair advantage.  
I think these can be solved with a couple of simple changes:  
1. Frozen players cause frost damage and slowing to enemy players. This keeps teams from puppy guarding and gives that players team a better chance to thaw them.  
2. Decrease time to thaw to match mercy's rez speed. The fact that mercy can effectively instantly unfreeze a player is just too much advantage currently, especially since she can move while thawing which no other character can do. That alone is an incredible advantage.  
3. Increase team size to 6. 3 v 4 is far harder to come back from than 5 v 6. At 6 players per team players can attempt more risky actions like thawing an isolated player. This will also allow achievements to be more possible. As larger teams means more opportunities to charge ults and for thaw interuptions. Currently on xbox only .01 percent of OW players have the ult achievement and only .004 percent have the thaw interuptions achievement, making them more difficult than almost any other achievement in the game.",2021-01-03 00:02:37

If I put the settings to ultra but keep the same display based fps setting, it will crash.

I was going through some YouTubes today (as we all do) and I found this fact about Warcraft R3. What with how crazy some of the workshop modes have gotten, expanding well beyond the genre of OW, I just can't help but wonder at the end of the day who owns the rights to distribute a concept (or genre even) that could potentially spawn from a workshop game mode.

Overwatch,2021,1,"Hey guys. I don‚Äôt post here much at all, but recently my younger sister got herself a Switch Lite and Overwatch so she can learn how to be a console gamer like her brothers.

As a result, she sometimes struggles to multitask in the game, such as aiming, firing, and moving at the same time in a match.
So I ask my fellow heroes a question: how do I teach my younger sister, a literal new gamer, how to play Overwatch on a more basic and fundamentally sound level? If it helps, she‚Äôs currently making her mains Roadhog and Widowmaker, although the latter she doesn‚Äôt play to her strengths much, I understand that more just not knowing each character‚Äôs playstyles.

Overwatch,2021,1,"Good afternoon everyone, 

I am going to make a bulleted list of my thoughts on overwatch right now. Please keep in mind these are my opinions. I am a 4K DPS player, I know my opinions aren‚Äôt valid. Anyways let‚Äôs get started:

1. Flex Que- This was a genius idea, but it was introduced in the worst way possible. So let‚Äôs say you are a 4300 support player, the game automatically thinks that you‚Äôre a 4300 dps and tank player which it shouldn‚Äôt. I and others have had multiple games where people are flex queuing and having no idea how to play that role. 

2. Power Creeps- We all know the current meta ball/sig/Ashe/echo/bap/brig/zen. Notice how all of these characters are post launch(besides zen). Instead of buffing heroes, you nerf the power creeps, because if you keep buffing heroes, you make more power creeps and nobody wants that. 

3. Matchmaker- What I don‚Äôt get with the current matchmaker is how diamond can play against golds and golds playing against bronze and plat playing against silver. A diamond will obviously destroy a gold and a gold will destroy a bronze. I just don‚Äôt see how that is fair to the lower ranks.  I have had multiple top500 games where my team gets a diamond. And that diamond is going up against the top100 player. How is that fair? They, obviously, get pounded into the ground. 

4. Console- Console is probably the worst it has ever been. With ddossing and MnK it‚Äôs a total mess. I know it all falls down on Microsoft and Sony to deal with ddossing. But Blizzard could do something about MnK, they could put MnK players in the same lobby with each other. Not the best idea I know but what else can you do.

5. Open Que Boosted- So let‚Äôs say you are a 3900 open que player, the game automatically thinks you are a 3900 player for all roles in role que. I‚Äôm going to be honest, 3900 open que is not 3900 role que. 3900 open que is probably diamond at most depending on the player.",2021-01-03 16:14:20

	4.	Off meta mains that maybe sometimes play a hero that isn‚Äôt best suited for the team, but still give it 100%. 

	5.	In it for themselves DPS mains who seemingly don‚Äôt care if your the team wins, as long as they have golds and POTG. But at least they are doing their job or damage and kills.

	6.	People who say ‚Äúyou‚Äôre playing an off meta hero so anything that goes wrong is your fault and anything that goes right is you being carried.‚Äù

	7.	Mercy mains that LOVE to battle Mercy while the rest of their team dies. Rein mains that just charge in and kill themselves. And anyone that picks healer and tank but really just wants to play DPS so that‚Äôs what they do. IE. not doing their job at all. 

	8.	All the toxic people that get mad but at least still try to win. 

	9.	Throwers and leavers. Usually also toxic, but not trying to win at this point. 

	10.	Griefers... as well as any time a Mei walls off their team or blocks their teams damage... fuck you (even if it‚Äôs an accident, it‚Äôs inexplicably aggravating that there is a hero that can absolutely fuck their teammates while genuinely trying to help.

Loss
Win
Loss
Loss

etc.

   And I‚Äôm in Diamond, which in my opinion is the most annoying rank to be a part of. It seems congested with a huge amount of smurfs, so many to the point every game becomes ‚Äúthe better smurf wins‚Äù, and then masters players who are throwing and/or trolling. 
   And by then I‚Äôm down 100 SR, but because of that I play more because I don‚Äôt want to be down so much. But then past midnight, there seems to be way less throwers. And usually I go on big win streaks after 12:00.

Overwatch,2021,1,"Hi everyone,

So I was thinking that although Winston is amazing within the right team composition and with good competent teammates, he can also still feel like he‚Äôs lacking in power/kill potential.

Now, this isn‚Äôt me saying ‚Äúbuff Winston, he can‚Äôt do enough damage, he‚Äôs the worst tank‚Äù bla bla bla, because that really isn‚Äôt the case. There‚Äôs not really any bad tanks to begin with. Just some better than others in any given meta. 

What I AM saying is that he could have the following things adjusted or added to his kit to make him that tiny bit better;

In addition to how his Tesla Cannon currently works, Winston should be able to partially slow a single target whilst also dealing damage to all enemies in his Area of Effect. This would decrease the chance for his target to escape. The slow shouldn‚Äôt be anywhere near as strong as Mei‚Äôs but it should definitely be noticeable.

If that doesn‚Äôt sound like a good idea to you, then maybe his damage numbers could be tweaked ever so slightly so that his kill potential when diving back lines or disrupting snipers on the high ground can be improved. Or maybe even just give him a larger magazine size by like 15 ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

He also doesn‚Äôt have a passive ability. A suggestion for this would be that when he is surrounded by at least 2 teammates, he receives either a buff in damage or a passive continuous heal. To balance this, the damage buff/heal should NOT stack even if there are more than 2 teammates around him. 

At the end of the day, this is just a suggestion and you don‚Äôt have to agree with me. But if you do, then please leave an upvote ‚¨ÜÔ∏è üòä",2021-01-03 18:47:58

I've enjoyed playing with them but one of the issues I've seen is that they don't understand the concept of grouping. They believe that when you respawn you should head straight to the point to try and contest it, even if it's a 6v1 scenario, not because they believe they can win it but because they know the objective is to get on the point, and that grouping is wasting time as you're not trying to contest it. 

I think i remember seeing conversation from years ago why that's bad and why you should group up, but i haven't been able to find any guides or videos on the topic. I was looking for the pros of waiting and grouping and why you shouldn't try and push by yourself, perhaps something i could share with my friends? Of course if they're not open to learning I'm not going to push them, it would be more food for thought than anything.

My current level is 26, and I tried Competitive. After two straight losses, I figured I'd just hit the arcade modes until Season 26 rolled around. I'm at Endorsement level 2, which I guess is ok.

\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~

I've played 23 hours of Overwatch in total since I got it last week. Here are my hours:

\------------------------------------------------------------------

Quickplay - 12 hours

I wasn't really the biggest fan of quickplay for a while, with all of the class restrictions. Then I realized that It was a great way to adapt to the team's conditions to help assure victory.

Arcade - 6 hours

I mainly spend my time here to get lootboxes and use Quick Play Classic(I really like that game mode). It's fun with all of the different game modes.

Game Browser - 5 hours

I spent my time in the custom games here, mainly the ""Attack on Titan"", ""Chill no Kill"", and ""Castle RP"" ones. There are some really nice people there, it's almost a guaranteed good time for me.

Competitive - 19 minutes

Do I need to say anything here? I haven't played a lot, just 2 games.

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Support - 10 hours played - 28 games won

Damage - 8 hours played - 20 games won

Tank - 5 hours played - 21 games won

\-------------------------------------------------------------------

Mercy - 8 hours

Reinhardt - 3 hours

Genji - 2 hours

Reaper - 1 hour

Sombra - 1 hour

Bastion - 1 hour

Ana - 56 minutes

Ashe - 44 minutes

Lucio - 36 minutes

Widowmaker - 25 minutes

Tracer - 19 minutes

Mei - 18 minutes

Hanzo - 17 minutes

Sigma - 16 minutes

Orisa - 16 minutes

Zenyatta - 15 minutes

Pharah - 14 minutes

D.Va - 14 minutes

McCree - 14 minutes

Junkrat - 14 minutes

Roadhog - 13 minutes

Literally everyone else - 10 minutes or less

\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~

I've played 153 games, and only won 69, which hints to my lack of skill as a newbie. I've spent 39 minutes on fire, which is horrible in my eyes. Only 2 hours of objective time, which is honestly idiotic on my end. My best kill streak is 22, which I guess is mediocre.

As for achievements and all that, I've gotten 16/148. I guess it's pretty good.

\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~

Class Notes-

Mercy: I've always been one to play Medic, no matter what game it is. This class is one of diligence. You're a priority target to the smart players, and sometimes the tide of balance can depend on your choices. Heal this person or that person? Rez the Wrecking Ball or the Reinhardt? The healers have power over Life and Death. I've switched up my settings to higher sensitivities and turned off toggle Guardian Angel, and turned on toggle beam. It's really helped.

Reinhardt: I never thought I'd get so many hours on this dude, but here we are. His shield may seem strong, but in the team fights where it's really needed, it only holds up for so long with the rain of enemy fire. My ideal strategy is to charge their tank and take them out, pretty much opening the rest of their team up. There's only two factors that can deny that - Two tanks and Bastion. I can't take out one tank without taking fire from the other. But Bastion- Oh boy. He's got a sizeable health bar and serious damage output - a tank's worst weakness. Reinhardt's rocket hammer does 85 damage per swing or something, so one's best bet is to fire strike them or charge them, if your's has already cooled down. He annihilates shields in seconds while in sentry mode, and he can easily get the play of the game by sitting on the payload on letting all hell loose on the enemy.

&amp;#x200B;

Genji: I love those silent, assassin type of players, I'm that kind of player, depending on how I'm feeling. Genji requires accuracy, has speed, he's everything I want in that kind of class. High damage, High base mobility, pretty good abilities, and an ultimate that kicks ass when used properly. His small health bar does make him viable to ultimate shutdowns, which are really annoying, so I flank the enemy and hope their Bastion doesn't see me.

&amp;#x200B;

Reaper: He's just a generally good, all-around class. Ridiculous damage at short range, where the enemies are, a good health bar, high mobility and repositioning abilities, and more. Just like Genji, his ultimate works best with the element of surprise. Most Reapers know when they're in a fight they can't handle, so they just wraith out of there. Wraith can also get you into some sticky situations, especially when people see you in your smoky black haze and gang up on you. Shadow TPing is best used when not in battle, in contrast to Wraith form, used for repositioning and complementing Reaper's general flank playstyle. 

Sombra: I'm really a sucker for these high-mobility classes. Sombra's ability to hack enemies and health packs allow her to support her team with assists and faster healing. Apart from that, I've found that lots of people just walk behind us and ult while we're busy in a teamfight. Sombra is great for picking off lone survivors, which I love about her. Her ult is also great, especially when paired with Barrage or Death Blossom. It deactivates shield, prevents abilities and ults, making the enemy as vulnerable as possible, just the way I like them.

&amp;#x200B;

Bastion: My least played class with 1 hour, I like Bastion because he's powerful, sturdy, and self-sufficient. He can heal himself, allowing your support classes to turn their attention to more important matters. He also has serious firepower and a lot of health, making him a force to be reckoned with. His ability to enter sentry configuration while on a payload makes him incredibly useful for holding down a payload or objective. When damage buffed or nanoboosted, you can really bring the pain in sentry mode.

\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~

Overwatch,2021,1,"It's just a joke how especially in lower ranks the highest value play you can do at one point is to spin around point as ball, as it is also an act which requires the least amount of skill. Sure you can focus him down and kill him in like I don't know 10 seconds with that extra 700 hp he can gain but then what when the rest of his team is there? Capping how long he can attach to an object merely nerfs this one play style while leaving the rest completely untouched. Feel like this would not change anything in high ranks, just make him less frustrating in the lower ranks.

Upon further investigation, we found out that Junkertown was extremely common if not the only skirmish map.

Overwatch,2021,1,"Sombra has arguably been the most problematic character in terms of balance since her release, frequently being among the least-played, lowest w/r heroes in the game. This is despite her kit being fairly strong, with her being able to TP out of combat at the click of the button‚Äîmaking her flank positioning difficult to punish. So why doesn't she become meta? Simple: her damage is too low to be a consistently dominant dps. Blizzard could one day buff her damage in one way or another so she can have an OP reign, and her kit would still presumably remain the same. But, with the communities general disliking of Sombra, and the free-escape logic of her kit, a massive buff to Sombra would inevitably be met with disdain from much of the player base to say the least.

So why not consider reworking her, like Blizzard did with Torbjorn and Symmetra? For fun, I put together a few ideas to make an example of what a rework could look like, purely in terms of gameplay:

**Machine Pistol**: the bullet spread is tighter and more reliable, effective for medium range.

**Right Click**: modifies the machine pistol to fire twice as fast but with terrible accuracy (for high dps in shotgun-range vs. tanks).

**Translocator**: now when Sombra throws out the beacon, she is forced to TP to it the second it connects to any surface (she can still manually TP mid-air). When she TPs, she has invisibility and invulnerability for 2 seconds (unless she fires her weapon/uses an ability).

**Electric Spear** (for lack of a better name): Sombra lobs out an immaterial spear that damages, briefly stuns, then briefly hacks the opponent when they exit the stun.

**EMP Grenade**: now that Sombra can't reliably invis into an enemy team, her ult instead can be thrown much like Baptiste's Immortality Field, where it pauses for a second then explodes‚Äîdealing damage and disabling barriers in a wide radius, and hacking the three nearest enemies who took damage. The closer an enemy is to the outer rim of the radius, the more damage they take.",2021-01-04 09:54:51

Overwatch,2021,1,"A few Winston Rework Suggestions

Hi everyone,

So I was thinking that although Winston is amazing within the right team composition and with good competent teammates, he can also still feel like he‚Äôs lacking in power/kill potential.

Now, this isn‚Äôt me saying ‚Äúbuff Winston, he can‚Äôt do enough damage, he‚Äôs the worst tank‚Äù bla bla bla, because that really isn‚Äôt the case. There‚Äôs not really any bad tanks to begin with. Just some better than others in any given meta. 

What I AM saying is that he could have the following things adjusted or added to his kit to make him that tiny bit better;

In addition to how his Tesla Cannon currently works, Winston should be able to partially slow a single target whilst also dealing damage to all enemies in his Area of Effect. This would decrease the chance for his target to escape. The slow shouldn‚Äôt be anywhere near as strong as Mei‚Äôs but it should definitely be noticeable.

If that doesn‚Äôt sound like a good idea to you, then maybe his damage numbers could be tweaked ever so slightly so that his kill potential when diving back lines or disrupting snipers on the high ground can be improved. Or maybe even just give him a larger magazine size by like 15 ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

He also doesn‚Äôt have a passive ability. A suggestion for this would be that when he is surrounded by at least 2 teammates, he receives either a buff in damage or a passive continuous heal. To balance this, the damage buff/heal should NOT stack even if there are more than 2 teammates around him. 

At the end of the day, this is just a suggestion and you don‚Äôt have to agree with me. But if you do, then please leave an upvote ‚¨ÜÔ∏è üòä",2021-01-04 12:39:30

I love overwatch from a mechanical standpoint and actually genuinely enjoy the team play and competitive atmosphere. I've come to realize though that in its current state this game is literally the biggest unplayable pile of dog shit I've ever put my hands on. 
I dont know if carrying teams who cant focus on one target in front of all them several times in a row has altered my matchmaking algorithm but its destroyed all the enjoyment I have of this game. 
Not only do I CONSTANTLY get leavers, I am routinely paired with players who don't have the slightest idea of how to play the game let alone their chosen role. For reference I am someone who topped out at low diamond but, actually lost those points for the exact reasons I'm mentioning right now. Think im just a low elo complainer? Well sorry GM overlords I've actually kept loose track of my last 25 games and in that span I'm 13-10. Of those 10 losses FUCKING 5 HAD LEAVERS. 2 OF THEM HAD OUTRIGHT THROWERS.
 So how about the remaining three losses? One of them was a close match where the healer disconnected after going into the final round. So 70% of my losses happened because of throwers and leavers. 
Those 25 games were the ones I played before today. My session today was some of the worst overwatch I've ever seen in my life and its driven me to never ever touch this game again. 3 straight losses with the biggest pair of dogshit healers I've ever played with, whom I was placed on a team with TWO TIMES in a row. I will gladly post videos of the matches if anyone wants to see so you know I'm not just bitching for no reason. If I lose because the other team is better then thats life. Those losses are zero issue and make the game fun. That isn't whats fucking happening though. I keep sliding down because the imbeciles who made this game literally can't put the stop gaps in place to stop people from abusing or being so horrible they actually ruin the game. I will not be buying overwatch 2, playing one more second, or giving any blizzard product whatsoever my time money or attention. Thanks for letting me rant reddit, and fuck you overwatch. Goodbye and good riddance.
EDIT:
Editing to mention at least 3 or 4 of my wins had leavers on the other teams which is bullshit and just as horrible.",2021-01-04 12:59:17

Overwatch,2021,1,Playing Echo as Supports moments.,2021-01-04 13:59:07
Overwatch,2021,1,"I feel like the game has a lot of designs that work very well for short term gain, but hurt longevity and I'm curious to know how other people feel about it. 

Limited time skins are cool and fun to pursue. They create a strong sense of urgency to play the game and incentivize the player base to keep the game populated. But imagine introducing your friend to the game and maybe they're on the fence until they see a cool skin for their favorite character they want to pursue, and you have to explain ""You can't have that ever."" That will likely happen several times considering the amount of unavailable content in the game. I wouldn't blame someone for not caring to stick around after making an effort and being told they can't have what they see.

Likewise, the way weekly loot boxes work is a strong incentive to be a body in the game. But it being tied to wins discourages players from playing any game mode or character they want to experiment with. Getting your 9 wins takes about an hour and a half at the fastest, assuming you get a perfect streak of wins, and a lot of people don't have a lot of spare time to play. Using me as an example, I would like to get better as other characters, but if I want regular loot boxes I'm obligated to play as my best performing character until I have my wins for the week, at which point I don't have much time left for leisure play. 

What I'm getting at here is if I could lose a game and it still count as 1/3 of a win (Or even 1/5. The important thing here is allowing forward momentum with less quality performance) , I'd feel more free to play new characters instead of having to play my best character until the ""job"" is done and I can ""relax."" 

The TL;DR is that the two features do a great job of getting bodies into the game to populate it, but do a poor job of creating genuine interest in the game due to stifling potential goals for new players and inadvertently ""punishing"" experimental or casual play. Am I alone in that attitude?",2021-01-04 14:05:31

Many play styles should be added to tanks and supports where it can make damage players feel no differences and extend the play style so people are balanced on roles.",2021-01-04 14:10:27

I seem to maintain a relatively even win loss ratio, but it almost seems artificial in that I feel like matches I get into are rarely ever actually competitive, because one side never even stood a chance to compete in the first place.

That being said I dont nearly play as much as I did so it just be a luck factor and I might find more even games if I played more. Anyone else experience this?",2021-01-04 14:25:46

Overwatch,2021,1,"Thought of these after getting frosty road hog (that was a long grind on quick play. I‚Äôm a DPS Main).


1- Shipwreck Reaper

-It‚Äôs another pirate skin, but the aesthetic fits reaper. He‚Äôd have a squid-like mask (like Davy Jones), a blue, tattered jacket, a pirate outfit (like a algae-crusted bandolier and stuff), and a tricorn hat.  Lots of barnacles and algae on him and a ship wheel belt buckle. His shotguns would be modeled after pirate guns with ‚ÄúDRWND‚Äù (drowned) on it. Teleporting would play seagull sounds instead of crows.


2- Death Knight Genji

-This WoW crossover would fit well with genji. In fact a warcraft event would be cool for bliss on one year. With the way mercy saved him, she could be a val‚Äôkyr and he could be a death knight. This skin would use the ‚Äúyoung genji‚Äù base. He‚Äôd have long, white hair, pale blue/gray skin, and icy blue eyes like Rime Sigma. His blades/shruiken would be modeled after frostmourne with dark metal, skull designs, and icy runes. His ult would summon a skeletal dragon, and he could say ‚ÄúDeath becomes me‚Äù or something like that.


3- Baker D.Va

-I kind of thought this was a missed opportunity this Winter, but the mech could be a gingerbread house construct thing with candy ‚Äúlights‚Äù, frosting highlights, and the thrusters could blast out sugar clouds. Hana would wear a chef/baker outfit and would use a mixer pistol. Also, her mech‚Äôs blasters could have candy particles or cookie crumb particles. 


4- Scavenger/Nekhbet Pharah

-This skin would give Pharah‚Äôs armor a kind of ‚Äúcobbled together‚Äù look with a dark color scheme. Her suit would also take after vultures with a ruff around her neck. Based on the spider-man homecoming vulture suit.


5- Reef/Deep Reinhardt

-Reinhardt‚Äôs suit would be modeled after an old diving suit with coral and sea life growing on it. Animated Sea anemones would grow from his shoulders. His hammer is a long, modified anchor. Instead of a Lion, a starfish would form the center of his shield. Also his back thruster would fire pressurized water to propel his charge.",2021-01-04 15:44:20

Overwatch,2021,1,"I've been getting back into overwatch again and am really enjoying reinhardt. After watching a few tutorials I've personally improved quite a bit, but keeping track of my team has been a challenge.  

Often times after losing a teamfight i will wait for the regroup, put up shield and start moving in and trying to make space/contesting a choke. after noticing no damage is coming out of my backline i notice my team has decided to piss off and go on a flanking adventure without me lol. I know i should be keeping better track of them but i find it really hard to see whats going on behind me. Ive tried flicking around to look behind myself but that has its problems as well as i expose my back to the enemy team and get discorded/ccd/poisoned. At this point should i still be trying to play reinhardt or switch to a more flanky tank and give up on shielding if my team is just not going to work with me?  

Another problem i run into is flanking tanks. Idk how this happens, but a rein or zarya or hog will flank my team and just start tearing them up and my team will be completely incapable of dealing with it. It doesn't really make sense to me because i know there's no way i can get away with that, i would get killed instantly. Ive gotten complaints that I should drop the front and chase this tank instead, but I feel its just a waste of resources as I waste so much time chasing this person to get in range to hit them with my hammer.  

I'll end this by saying im at the highest point of understanding the game as I've ever been, and been playing better than I've ever been, yet am at the lowest rank in my career (silver) LUL. My old strat was go solo as hog or spin on point as ball and that got me almost to plat. Maybe rein doesn't work at these ranks because you need your team to work with him? Idk.

Do you destroy it? *Thump you on the forehead* no dummy! Use your concussion rocket to knock them out of it so your team can finish them off.

I really tried, but everytime they spoke i lost focus, even of they were just giving advise. Then I'd die. I became even more anxious because more people join the voice chat. At the end they were telling me to do my job... And got so scared. I'm not expecting everyone to be nice on vc so is there any way to calm my nerves?? I seriously felt so bad... My first ever mic experience was really bad to calling me shit the first second of the game... I just need advise or maybe people to play competitive with that won't make me shake so much..

Overwatch,2021,1,"Hello everyone, my name is T and I am looking for a team of staff to help me build a brand new PC league which I believe has the potential to bring in a lot of opportunities.

This league which will be called Recall Esports will be compiled of 12 future teams in both the NA and EU regions and will utilize a round-Robin system after which we will host playoffs.

My goal is to have these games streamed and casted live to twitch, as well as reuploaded to other platforms such as YouTube.

I am looking for the following:

Commisioners
Casters
Administrators
Schedulers 
Bot Programmers
Producers 

Our league will provide all inclusion and equal opportunity to everyone that may or may not come forward to work with us.

We will strive to be the best out there and grow until we have reached a level of semi-professsionality. 

If you believe you fit into one of these roles please by all means DM me and I will be sure to respond to you as soon as possible. 

Thank you all for your time and I look forward to seeing you all again in Recall Esports.",2021-01-05 03:08:24

I'm wondering, since they ""check stats"" and make sure all players in the group are so amazing .... do you tend to win more games in these groups, or is it the same?

Overwatch,2021,1,"When I started playing overwatch I came from call of duty where having a high rank (aka master prestige) was what everyone strived for, so it was a culture shock when I switched over and realised it's the complete opposite in this game. 

Fast forward 4 years and here I am a gold boarder ""hard stuck"" diamond player who gets blamed for everything even if my stats in the current match are higher than the second Support/DPs/Tank etc and it's really starting to get to me now everytime I play a match someone mentions my border and how many hours I have and how garbage I must be at the game to be stuck in diamond blah blah blah, even though they are stuck in this rank with me it wouldn't be as bad if it was only one maybe even two people flaming but I always end up the scape goat for the whole team and I'm sick of it.

I struggle with anxiety and used to use overwatch as an escape from life where I constantly get blamed for things I have no control over and now that has entered my gaming space, I've uninstalled overwatch many many times but always reinstall because the game it's self is amazing and unlike any game I've played before and when I do I always say that I'm not going to play comp but I always end up playing it eventually and then I'm reminded of why I hate people. I'm at a point where I just want to quit all multiplayer games because the toxic players I've run into in this game have permanently ruined my view on all competitive games, and just focus on good single player games, but I still have a competitive side and know I'll miss them.

CPU: R9 3900x - 3.8-4.1 MHz (according to CAM) 12 core 24 threads

GPU: EVGA NVIDIA GEFORCE GTX 1080Ti 11gb (GDDR4?)

RAM: Crucial 32 gig DDR4-2400 MHz

  
And Overwatch is on a SSD. Average frames on all low settings and render scale on 75% on 1080p is 180 in big team fights and 220 in small ones. I can hit constant 240 on some maps while walking around. Why is it not 240fps constant?

I have watched several streamers who have 2080tis and i9-9900ks and while streaming never drop below 240 frames on all low settings but with 100% render scale. I might have misunderstood this as I am pretty new to some of this stuff, but my CPU has 4 more cores and 8 more threads and their GPU is only +28% better according to [https://gpu.userbenchmark.com/Compare/Nvidia-RTX-2080-Ti-vs-Nvidia-GTX-1080-Ti/4027vs3918](https://gpu.userbenchmark.com/Compare/Nvidia-RTX-2080-Ti-vs-Nvidia-GTX-1080-Ti/4027vs3918). I am fine with what I have cause a low of 180 is nothing to scoff at and I have G-SYNC so it isn't causing tearing, I am just wondering if I have set up something wrong.

Thanks for your time!

Overwatch,2021,1,"My friends first 6K
    I am a gamer, I play a game called Overwatch. Overwatch is a competitive six player versus six player game. One of the game modes that you can play is called ‚ÄúCapture the objective‚Äù, these game modes usually last two to three rounds each round lasting five to six minutes.  It was the second round; my team won the first round. If we won the second round we would win the game and get bragging rights. We were about to secure the second round. I had just died and was respawning; my team was in a giant fight and had the enemy team distracted. I saw an opportunity that I wanted to take, I went left instead of down the middle with the rest of my team. When I got to my destination I was behind the entire enemy team, I was able to use my ultimate ability that allowed me to kill anyone with a single bullet. I took a deep breath and used the ultimate ability, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs high noon‚Ä¶‚Äù my character said, the words resonated through the battle field, none of the enemy team acknowledged that I had used my ultimate ability and had a clear line of sight on all of them. As I watched the skull icons on my screen multiply I saw the best opportunity to strike and kill them all, ‚ÄúDraw!‚Äù. ‚ÄúDouble kill, triple kill, quadruple kill, quintuple kill,  kill!‚Äù the game‚Äôs announcer said, ‚ÄúTeam kill!‚Äù those words echoed throughout the battle field as their lifeless bodies dropped to the floor. My team celebrated the battle I had just single handedly won. There was one final fight and none of the enemy team were able to make it to the objective to put the game into overtime. With my ultimate ability, we won the game and I got massive bragging rights.",2021-01-05 21:26:40

Overwatch,2021,1,"I just climbed 300 SR over the past two days without dropping a single game. 

Yep. 

So the story goes, I just watched The Queen's Gambit which drove me to revisiting chess which I haven't played since I was a kid. I pulled out my old books and started reading up on just the basics, and all the different tactics and strategies you can use. Started spending some time playing people online and trying to get back into that chess mindset. 

So after a couple days I go back to Overwatch and I see the game in a new light (as a Rein player anyway). I've become overly critical of my positioning, and how moving one way can create opportunity, or possibly jeopardize my position. 

Take his charge for instance. It's a powerful move, like sliding a rook across the board. But what happens when you do that? Your rook can become vulnerable if there is no piece to back it up. You also have to consider where the piece is going to end up. You might take out the knight, but if it means losing your rook, that's a bad trade. 

Another one is choosing targets. Say you have a Zen in a hallway, and you have your 76 and an enemy Ashe battling one another. Say Zen has 100HP and the Ashe is 200HP. You can kill the Zen with the fire strike, or you can use the fire strike on the Ashe and help your 76 win that fight who can then later help you take out the Zen who wasn't even in a position to deal any damage to your 76. 

To compare, in chess you can fork a rook and a bishop with your knight. And you might rush to take the free rook, but if you study it more carefully, you'll find more opportunity in taking out the bishop, because taking out the bishop puts the King in check, which forces your opponent to make another poor move, which ultimately leaves the rook available to take the next turn anyway. 

And to give one last example, it's learning how to move with a purpose. In chess, you always want to have a reason why you move a piece to a certain spot. It could be to apply pressure on another piece, or just to secure a certain position, or to defend one of your own pieces. So when you move around, think about what you're trying to accomplishment. 

Are you trying to be aggressive? Know when to do so. After doom has used his punch, or after Mcree uses his flash bang, or after Hog has used his hook. When you attack, you don't want to allow your opponent to have the ability to counter attack. You want to make sure when you go for a kill, you don't die as well (with rare exceptions). Because It's always better to retreat a piece than to outright lose it. 

Sometimes you want to fortify a certain position.Take a knight for example. If it's stuck on the side of the board, it can only jump to four different spots. But if it's in the middle of the board, it now has eight different squares it can attack. Say you're playing with 76 who is a hitscan with infinite range. When you hold up your shield, what kind of sightlines are you giving him? Is there a wall in front of him? Does he have sight of the point? Hold up your shield in positions that give your team the most options to attack. 

And finally, there are times when you need to move away from the frontline. Say you have your two rooks pinning the enemy Queen against the enemy King. Do you need to bring in your Queen as a third pin? No, the other pieces accomplish that. Dedicating another piece would be redundant. So if you're in a situation where you have your two DPS chasing down a Lucio, it makes no sense for you to give chase as well. You're better off covering another flank and putting yourself in a position where you can defend your supports that are still on point. 

I can probably come up with a few other examples, but you probably get the idea at this point. So if there's one take away, it's always ask yourself why you're moving to a certain position. Always have a reason for everything you do. 

That is all.",2021-01-05 23:59:56

Overwatch,2021,1,"&amp;#x200B;

Overwatch is literally a Countering game at this state. people just continue to counter each other everytime they see someone overpowering them.

and i think this isn't a healthy way of using ALL heroes. as just tools to counter.

hero picking need to be limted to once per round!

this will make metas more reasonable and counterable, **let me tell you why:**

in OW combo metas aint just 6 heroes. it's **often** 4 heroes and 2 replaceable to counter the enemy team.(mostly 1 support 1 DPS)

with removing the ability to swap heroes mid-round those metas can actually get countered a little to provide more balance rounds where both teams have wild cards. 

another thing is. Adding Triats/Talents/masteries or what ever you want to call it to Heroes.

This would make mirror heroes a little different.

**\*EXAMPLES\***

*i'd like to see a soldier with a rocket reset every kill.*

*i'd like to see a a pharah E that gravitate enemies instead of pushing*  
*or what about an bonus DMG to Ana's sleeping dart when someone wakes the sleeping person.*

*maybe a Right click for winston to shoot a beam that deal 100 dmg after charging for 1.5s with right click?*

either it be passives or actives it would add variety to the heroes

Even bland shooters such as CSGO has Weapon Variety (Eagle or Revolver).

&amp;#x200B;

many would say ""just play Paladins"". Paladins is so fast paced and does not compare to Overwatch

as overwatch is way more strategic than paladins.

in my honest opinion i believe overwatch can pull it better to make a healthy competitive side... 

Lets be honest in which WORLD did we see a matchmaking game that forces the players to play a Specific champ for a specific role. u are simplifying the meta. even though it was understandable and it  indeed solved it. it made the game feels.. caged.. and overall unfun.. the only thing keeping me is the wholesome community (better than other communities.)",2021-01-06 02:26:13

Overwatch,2021,1,"So I'm coming from Console and decided to buy Overwatch on PC to give it a go.

I have an older PC, but it should be able to run Overwatch just fine (as it has better benchmark scores than my laptop that was able to run it) - It has 8 gb of ram (dual channel) and an AMD Radeon HD 6970 GPU.

When I play any sort of game, I average around 60 fps (rocket league and r6) while Valorant averages around 90 fps. But when it comes to Overwatch however, my GPU usage drops from around 65% to about 30% and my fps drops to 20 during team fights.

The weirdest thing though is that I can play deathmatches just fine at 60 fps, yet quick play just kills my GPU for some reason.

I've updated my graphics card driver, I changed my RAM from single to dual channel, lowered all of my graphics settings in game, tried to repair the game, and even set Overwatch to prioritize GPU through my graphics settings.

Are there any possible fixes, or am I just toast?

Update:
I updated my GPU settings to AMD Crimson Beta from the Catalyst - also did a hard wipe on the system and Overwatch is pumping an average of 63 fps, coasting at a solid 70 (I capped it at 70 cause of my monitor) with occasional drops and a low GPU üëç",2021-01-06 04:43:09

I‚Äôm thinking of a tank that is most likely to kill an enemy that is trying to flank and not an enemy that is with their own team. Maybe an artillery like tank would be dope, high damage per shot with a low fire rate. That would be a unique tank that would be cool to have and be confident with against flanking heroes. If the tank has an artillery that is a projectile and is known for doing high damage over a long distance, it can be considered a tank if they make the tank more of a protector than a barrier supply. Just like road hog for instance, he‚Äôs one of the only tanks that is known to be protective. Probably the only tank so far.",2021-01-06 07:46:13

I received a message after and braced myself (I play xbox so messages are few, far between, and usually very mean) but was so, so pleasantly surprised when I opened it to a thank you for carrying our team. :)

So my Damage and Support needed some work. So one day my friend told me to play some open queue and I was down beside the fact that I only played open queue for my placement matches. That's when I was realized I was ridiculously close to Platinum rank on open queue (2425 I believe at the time). After a few games, I was plat! WHAT!?!?!?! How could my Support and Damage be low-mid Silver but my Open Queue is Plat?! That's where you guys come in. What do you guys think I should be working on and what do you guys think is the best way to climb from your experience?

Overwatch,2021,1,"The similarities are uncanny, especially near the release of the game, where Torbjorn was practically the same as Engineer, having a turret that could be upgraded 3 times and you needed to collect scrap to upgrade and repair said turret, not to mention that level 3 uses rockets. But there are loads of other similarities like this in characters, the charge mechanic on the sniper rifle, a big Russian who carries around a big gun, a doctor from central Europe who uses a mysterious beam of healing energy to heal teammates, a explosives obsessed crazy person with a missing body part who fires grenades out of a launcher and can throw themselves into the air using a , a fast person who jumps into battle with a shotgun. Heck we have a character that is like a weapon, an accurate syringe shooter that is ideal for long range that heals allies while harming enemies. I could go on. Along with the implementation of sprays and callouts where you can communicate with teammates while not having to use your own voice. While not unique to TF2 game modes like 6v6 and capture the flag were implemented similarly while pushing a payload along a predetermined route to an objective was completely unique to TF2. And my final point is that Jeff Caplin stated in an interview that TF2 is one of his favorite games of all time and he is proud to have his game compared to it. So my question is how much inspiration did Overwatch really take from TF2. This is not a jab against Overwatch or TF2, they are my favorite games in the world.",2021-01-06 18:39:16

Overwatch,2022,1,"Anyone else get the feeling that the overall quality of games drops drastically at the end of the season? I have made several observations and I hope you guys can share your own and maybe fill in some blanks for me.

1. In the last two days, I encountered more leavers than in the entire rest of the season. Why is that? Are people fatigued or is it just a coincidence on my part?
2. In the last two days, there have been more players on my team who evidently did not give a cr\*p. In open queue, overall willingness to build an actual viable team composition rather than picking 5 dps was incredibly low. It appeared that a lot of players wanted to bang out a few hours on heroes they usually don't play, but that is just an assumption based on all the lesser skilled Doomfists and Widowmakers with Parkinson's I saw.
3. Overall, these last few days have been the quietest in a while - communications-wise. Fewer players have entered the voice chat. Those few who did were mostly helpful and friendly, but I have also encountered a couple of extremely tilted and aggravated players. This resulted in an overall bad mood and a lack of coordination. In some matches, teams were never able to group fully once, despite my (and others) attempts to make that happen.

My only explanation was, that all of these observations correlated with an increase in unranked players. It would not be a stretch to assume that players who rarely play anymore, but do their placements from time to time, are less skilled than others. But I think that this is more likely to result in gameplay mistakes (not grouping up, being out of position), not in the toxicity and ignorance I encountered.

I‚Äôm currently capped at 237 fps with gsync properly set up. My fps dips down to 170-200 during fights. I‚Äôve tried turning all of my settings real low and really high. I‚Äôve even monitored my hardware with MSI Afterburner and dont see any maxing out on my gpu or any one of my like 20 something cpu cores. My memory usage is at 40% on average.

What am I doing wrong and how do I fix it?

Overwatch,2022,1,"So I‚Äôve been playing since season 1. Mostly I‚Äôm a gold player. Sometimes o get into plat. I‚Äôve been on this very slow decline for the last 6 months. Now I‚Äôm in bronze. What is happening. I‚Äôm clearly not getting worse. 

The game isn‚Äôt as fun as it used to be.",2022-01-01 16:27:16
Overwatch,2022,1,"This is for the balancing of Ranked btw

Unfortunately as we all know the game is not balanced. Not even close. And this sucks because if you're favourite hero is bad, then you have no fun regardless of the mode you're playing. For example, hero's like Reinhardt, Genji, Doomfist, Lucio, Bastion, and a few more. These hero's are not just bad though, they are borderline useless. Why would you pick rein when to get any value whatsoever you must essentially fully commit your entire life with the hopes your team will either trust you or help you, if you are in a solo scenario like SoloQ then you will almost assuredly receive little to no help, making rein not only boring because you cant do anything, but also a determent to the team if your team either doesn't fully commit with you or fun a hero like Lucio, which we have already established as being a bad hero right now. However Rein and Lucio are bad for different reasons, Rein is bad because he feels like a walking ult battery that can basically never do anything without his team babysitting him, but Lucio is bad because the comps he works with are bad in the meta as well as other supports just being vastly superior to him, hero's like brig, zen and bap are far superior due to more utility, higher damage, more healing, and in some cases even easier to play and get value with.

Now doomfist from a games design perspective is simply bad, he is extremely niche and basically never works unless the enemy team has a crowd control ability while also doomfist being extremely unfun to play against, it isn't fun and feels undeserved to just randomly to turned to dust by him instantly without any input of your own, and its boring for the doomfist player to be CC'd and have 0 impact and no ability to achieve anything regardless of how practiced they are on this hero.

Genji is different from doomfist. Genji is an ok hero, He has his niche but if you're good enough you can make him work in most scenarios due to his mobility and potential. However the only actual Genji can produce is either by 50/50ing his life by diving in and trying to quickly get a pick because he has no other way to ensure a pick. However it isn't 50/50, its 1/6. If you're against a team that pays any attention whatsoever then genji essentially gets nothing done other than securing a kill every so often when you're other superior DPS damages them into such a low health state that genji can secure that kill. Genji's blade without Nano is completely useless, It is either used for cleanup, which again is pretty useless for an ultimate, using during a team fight is basically guaranteed death in Diamond and above. However his nano blade is extremely strong, most likely the best ult combo in the game due to its potential but other than 6 seconds of nano blade (which aren't very difficult to shut down if you're prepared) He basically just sits around all game and does nothing. Another thing is genji is literally a throw pick unless your team deliberately swaps to the heros that genji needs to survive, whether it be ana and mercy, your zarya committing her team bubble to you while you run ana mercy, or going full dive, but genji isn't the best dive DPS at all, not even close, why would you pick genji when you can just pick Tracer or Echo. Genji has 0 relevence because of the games massive CC issues, Badly designed maps and hero's, Damage and healing being far too high, and a multitude of other issues that effects this hero.

Now onto the biggest issues we have in Overwatch In my opinion. Brig, Zen, Baptiste, Sigma, Echo, Hanzo, McCree. These hero's are ludicrously overpowered and some are overkitted. Whether you agree or not is up to you, but all of these hero's 100% have something that is downright unfair and extremely boring to play against.

# Baptiste

Immortality Field is simply a joke of a cooldown, this thing has been broken since the release of the hero, Not because it has too much health or its radius is too big, but simply because of its existence. There simply should not be a cooldown that has the ability to completely mitigate Ults, 1-shot-combos, or save people that deserve to die for making a mistake. Its a get out of jail free card that makes it that mistakes cannot be punished so not only is it extremely boring and tilting to play against, It's been this way since the hero came out and still we haven't reworked it yet.

His damage output and healing output is absolutely hilarious. He does 24 damage a shot at 0 fall off range, 7.2 per shot at max which is 25-45 metres. Soldier does 20 per shot while only shooting 3 extra bullets per second compared to Baptiste, his falloff range is between 30-50 metres making him a better DPS than Baptiste however the fact that their damage output is even this close is genuinely ridiculous. Compare this with his ability to heal his entire team at the same time with his right click, he is simply just a better hero is essentially every way when compared to soldier, he is a DPS that can heal his entire time at 70-50 burst healing per second as well as his regeneration ability which heals at 15 per second for a total of 75 health to allies, and 30 health per second to himself for a total of 150. This hero isn't just broken in terms of the abilities he has but also the numbers he produces and we didn't even talk about his mobility in his rocket boots which would be fine granted he didn't have what he already does.

# Brig

Lets be honest we all already know all the issues brig has, Her giant healing radius, her ability to turn any hero in the game into an unkillable machine by essentially being the best 1v1 hero in the entire game and being extremely tanky. She can literally just stand on top of a zen for example making him undivable, Letting him shred the enemy team with his damage and discord and letting the brig protect him and making him borderline unkillable as long as she's with him, pair this with the Unbelievable healing range of inspire and it doesnt matter where she is, as long as she procs inspire with her whip and doesn't juts spam out repair packs then her healing output paired with zen makes them a powerhouse of damage and healing while also being essnetially unpunishable.

Now these are just the biggest and most obvious issues I have with the game, I could of went into more detail of how the other heros I mentioned where broken but the post is already too long. I would love to hear you feedback and if you agree or disagree :)",2022-01-01 16:36:35

Overwatch,2022,1,"Happy New Year!

With 2022 potentially being the last full year of OW1, I thought I'd put together a list to show which characters are still in need of Legendry Skins. Since Summer Games 2020, they've given Skins to characters that didn't have one for that certain Event so they seem to at least acknowledge that players want the distribution to be more fair. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Lunar New Year**

* **Tank:** Sigma - Wrecking Ball
* **Damage:** Doomfist - Junkrat - Solider 76 - Symmetra
* **Support:** Ana - Baptiste

&amp;#x200B;

**Archives**

* **Tank:** DVa - Reinhardt - Sigma - Wrecking Ball
* **Damage:** Echo - Symmetra 
* **Support:** Brigitte - Zenyatta

&amp;#x200B;

**Anniversary**

* **Tank:** Reinhardt - Sigma
* **Damage:** Echo - Widowmaker
* **Support:** Ana

&amp;#x200B;

**Summer Games**

* **Tank:** \-
* **Damage:** Bastion
* **Support:** Moira

&amp;#x200B;

**Halloween Terror**

* Baptiste...

&amp;#x200B;

**Winter Wonderland**

* **Tank:** \-
* **Damage:** Ashe - Echo - Pharah
* **Support:** Brigitte


It's interesting that Lunar New Year has the most to get through, especially considering most of them are pre-release heroes. If the Devs do the right thing this year, every character could have a Legendry skins for Anniversary, Summer Games, Halloween Terror and Winter Wonderland. Archives could've joined that list if they didn't give all the Legendry skins to characters that already had one last year...",2022-01-01 16:56:05

Overwatch,2022,1,Why D.Va is the Perfect Waifu.,2022-01-01 19:08:52
Overwatch,2022,1,"I went and tried the other popular shooters, out of curiosity.

Quake champions, halo infinite, valorant, apex legends, team fortress 2. I gave them a try of 3 to 5 matches each to form an opinion.

All of them have not great matchmaking, i was put with people who clerly knew what they were doing and colorful custom skins.

Apex Legends and Valorant weren't fun because of the respawn system - it feels bad to wander the map, for only a few seconds of action, and then spend upwards of minutes waiting to respawn. 

Halo Infinite was a strange game because it was more effective sneaking/running around spamming melee (it takes 2 melee to kill someone, or 1 from behind, and everyone can sprint like soldier 76), than actually shooting enemies, which seem to do tickle damage, which they regenerate their shield.

Quake Champions had the best feeling combat, but the matchmaking is bad, even as someone who played years of quake and has a decent mechanical skill, i was put with veterans who knew the map inside and out with the best peek angles. It is not a bad game if someone decides to stick with it.

Honorable mention: Team Fortress 2 is one of my favorite which i've played it to death. It is very accessible where even a beginner can feel useful, by pocketing as Medic, playing engineer, or roaming as soldier/heavy. Easy to hit people because hitboxs are slower. There can be some cheesiness with invisible spies, sentry nests, and rocket spam (which is about twice the radius of pharah), random crits. The community has a party vibe, can have 20-40 people in one server, trolling and micspam are a common thing, and some matches can go on for hours.

And finally Overwatch, i think it's enduring success is it's accessible, the beginner can play hero like roadhog, torbjorn, or moira and feel like they meanijngfully contribute to the team with very little effort. And even the worst player can kill a pro sometimes with roadhog. Art is beautiful and easy to identify what's going on like team fortress 2. There are some frustrations like Bastion, torbjorn, symmetra..",2022-01-01 19:09:28

Additionally, my mechanical skills have dwindled since I haven't been gaming really at all since 2018",2022-01-02 11:21:13

It just doesn't make sense seeing as how every hero in the game has at least 7 emotes and more than 30 voice lines and sprays. It seems like such a big flaw only allowing players to equip only 4 of these and limit themselves. I think an easy fix to this would be to make the emote, voice line, and spray wheel as big as the com menu which has 8 spaces. If this were to be implemented it would be such a nice little update that everyone would appreciate.",2022-01-02 12:23:22

Overwatch,2022,1,"In his latest video Super's overtime gets triggred regardless of someone touching the point 3 seconds before the point is capped. The rest of the video is him saying that this shouldn't occur and testing different cases. I believe that the reason that Super's game went into overtime is because of how overtime may be programmed. Overtime works by activating if an opposing player has stepped on the point 3 seconds before. The easiest way to write this into the game would have a boolean become true when a player steps on the point and the timer is 3 seconds before 100%, I think that this boolean does not turn off until the next round starts so when a opposing team caps the point at 96.5% or higher the boolean becomes true meaning overtime will enable no matter when the point is flipped again. I am going to test this and document my findings below",2022-01-02 20:08:29

Overwatch,2022,1,"Winter wonderland gets to have maps like snowed up king's row and black forest in addition to night time ecopoint antarctica and blizzard world. 

Does anyone else think we should get daytime King's Row exactly as it is in uprising for every other game mode with all the null sector stuff like the anti aircraft cannon instead of the Mondatta statue, wires running across the floor etc and night time Rialto only during the Archives event duration. And maybe just for fun Havana with the storm effects only for quick play and arcade in case theres a problem the storm causing performance issues in competitive.

Also allow these versions of the maps to be used in custom games just like halloween terror eichenwalde.

Overwatch,2022,1,So I picked up overwatch a few days ago because it was on sale and I saw it was reviewed pretty well at release. I played a few games and it was really fun I really enjoyed the characters and their abilities that I tried but then I got on a game on nunbani and I was doing pretty well on genii even got a double kill with his blade but then this big monkey kept jumping ontop of me like practically smothering me and I kept trying to dash away and wall climb but the jerk kept following me and for some reason his lightning kept milling me even though I was deflecting right back at him. Anyways some guy in voice chat was like bro your getting countered super hard you should play reaper and I was like okay I guess but I‚Äôve only played genii Cassidy and roadhog. But he was like cussing me out and pretty much said any idiot could play reaper but not so nicely‚Ä¶ so anyways I‚Äôm like okay sure I‚Äôll try reaper and he was like thank god. So i got the hang of reaper pretty quick I killed the money twice when he jumped on me but then he swapped from a monkey to this big floating guy who was like blocking all my shots with like 5 shields and like a crazy black whole move. So I had my ult and I knew what it did cuz I tried it in the practice range and I ulted right next to him but he hit me with a massive rock I tried to run but somehow it glitches and he clearly shot me around a corner! Then the guy on my team was like yelling at me calling me the r word. I tried to explain what happened but he kept saying nasty things to me and insulting my mother he said my mother should die of cancer because I smoke pole and all sorts of other stuff and I was just like wow‚Ä¶ so then it was pretty close after that I started playing Cassidy I even got another double kill with his ult. We got it to overtime it he was just shouting profanities at me the whole game he was like literally screaming into the mic saying don‚Äôt want to talk to me cuz your too much of a b word and also go f your sister again you inbred hillbilly hick. So I muted him but he was still typing stuff. So anyways needless to say I didn‚Äôt really want to play anymore. So I was just wondering. This like never happens right because how could people play a team game with this happening all the time right? It was just a freak occurrence that I shouldn‚Äôt worry about right?,2022-01-04 03:42:00

His response, ""No you're not"" told me he just wanted to argue... which is strange. Again... why was he angry at a game? The points you gain and lose in this game aren't real.

Overwatch,2022,1,"Over the past year or so, I've noticed that pedophiles and racist players have increased. From custom games that have ""pedoswelcome"" in the title, where you'd expect them to try and play Chris Hansen but instead they talk about horrifying things in voice match chat, to outright having pedophilic conversations in text match chat in random quick play games.

I'm done. I've seen groups with pedophiles looking for kids, I've seen custom games with the n word where all the people in the game are bashing minorities and slinging slurs at said minorities.

It was bad enough that smurfs have overtaken overwatch on console, now we have creeps and trashy people filling match chat with obscene messages. What is Blizzard doing in response to this? Nothing. You can report a player on console over 100 times, over a course of a year, and they won't even receive a suspension. Meanwhile, these creeps are using custom games to try and get children to contact them off game to try and groom them. Even said custom games are not taken down with reports.

At this point, the game has become a safe haven for criminals like them and a cesspool full of pedos.

Some screenshots I've managed to save, though most of it has happened without me being able to screenshot it.: https://imgur.com/a/ShZOgwW

Edit: spelling.

Edit #2: An earlier comment made a valid and reasonable point that invalidates more than half of this post. No predator would name a custom game, group, or open talk about these obscene things so blatantly. These are most likely edgy teenagers that don't know any better and are just looking for a rise out of someone. I'm sorry for throwing baseless accusations, I should gather more evidence if there is any before stating such accusations.

TL;DR: Blizzard's abandonment of moderation on console has lead to pedophiles and racists to fill the game, making it an unsafe game for children to play.",2022-01-04 13:40:08

Overwatch,2022,1,"WELCOME TO 2022! let's see if this year can destroy me from the inside out.

So, as many of you know, there was a creator party. While every who attended is under an NDA, us normal people can speculate on what is coming. Whether it is anything for Overwatch or Overwatch 2, all we know is we wont be getting a new game this year so lets consider what we know will be coming. 

First we have the comics!  
The current Cassidy comic series has only got 2 issues so far so 2022 will have 3 comics coming out (One coming out this month) and a Reaper short story. The game itself doesn't have any lore bits in it aside from the interactions and small bio's on the skins so we have to look to outside media for the story. Rumours say that Reapers short story might revolve around the family he was stalking in the Christmas comics but that is purely a rumour. 

Overwatch league is being played on OW2!.... And we wont be.  
the Overwatch League will be played on a early build of Overwatch 2 and presumably, all the character reworks will be done. The Overwatch league could be a good opportunity to see any OW2 news as they might reveal some redesigns or maybe even a cinematic (But I wouldn't hold my breath)

Most content creators that attended the meeting have said how happy they are, I mean, even Metro is keeping tight lipped on this! Am I hopeful? Yes! 

I think there are quite a few possibilities that could be coming in 2022 and because this is kind of the OW2 prep year, I think these are the things that could come out from a scale of 1-10.

New Map? 7/10  
Overwatch's latest maps have been deathmatch maps, but that is where it ends. No big maps that can be played in competitive have been released since the announcement of Havana in 2019... May of 2019 which mean this year marks the 3rd year without a big map. However, given Overwatches lack of content lately, a new map might not happen and will be saved for OW2.  
New hero? 5/10  
A new hero for Overwatch? yeah, I know, a little hopeful be just remember, content creators have been really happy and a new character would be some good news. A 5/10 rating is a little hopeful but I'm still praying for a new sniper so just let me dream.  
New Comics? 10/10  
Obviously, there are 3 comics coming out this year along with reapers story quest but I think there could be a new comic series coming out as well. So far, both 5 part comics have be centred around the heroes but I hope we will get a Talon comic series. Windowmaker could have one, Sigma could have one, just a whole bunch of characters could have one but we don't know.  
New OW2 news? 8/10  
I think OW2 news is almost a guarantee, we will learn something by at least the Overwatch league. Whether it's more reworks, more redesigns or sneak peeks of OW2, I can't imagine not getting any news this year.  
Overwatch 2 beta? 5/10  
The only reason this has a 5/10 rating is because, well, I am not sure. There is a chance we get a small snippet of the long awaited sequel, but we can only cross our fingers and hope for the best.

The game is, for lack of a better word, suffering. While it is easy to point fingers a blame others, this game is suffering and it isn't the developers fault. 2020 &amp;2021 have been tough years for us all and I don't blame them for delaying that game to improve everything but one thing that can be improved is the communication between community and creators. It's all well and good to please the content creators by showing them stuff but the game and community are suffering because we aren't receiving any news. 

I love this game and I don't want to see it suffer because things were handled wrong.

Overwatch,2022,1,"I've recently been watching some of the long videos about ranking a hero up to GM.

I've noticed some heroes are quite boring to watch, while others are very engaging and interesting.

If you watch streamers, which heroes are the most interesting and fun to watch?

///

For me, so far, it's be Ashe and Ana, for similar reasons.

Their kits have amounts of strategy that I found really engaging (especially Ana). Streamers can use their tools in interesting ways that make each match different from the other.

Compared to Soldier (which I get may be someone's most fun to watch), where their kit doesn't seem strategic, so each match feels the same (Which makes watching them less fun for me).

I'm really looking forward to an Echo video from a good streamer, because I feel that hero will be fun to watch.",2022-01-04 22:25:16

Overwatch,2022,1,"When I play damage, I usually play Reaper. I was under the impression that Reaper was a good counter for tanks like Winston and Roadhog. Before I took a break, that was the case, and I always did pretty well. That's not the case anymore. The hook+headshot combo will immediately obliterate my 250 HP, critical hit kill icon, game over.

Someone suggested that this was because I had gotten into the bad habit of holding forward after I get hooked, and that made it easier for them to maximise damage. So I stopped doing that. Now I either try to move to the side or move back. I even try to Wraith my way out sometimes. It doesn't work. I can be mashing the shift key like a lunatic and it won't ever activate fast enough to save me.

My reflexes aren't fast enough to consistently wraith *through* a hook, and I can't think of a way to practically train them to be that fast, so I can't think of any immediate solutions. It's just not very fun for my favourite damage hero to constantly be beaten in a fight before I can even get close enough to do any more than scratch damage, against a hero he's supposedly good at countering.

So, can Roadhog oneshot Reaper? Or is there something else I'm missing? And if he can, what can I do (apart from the obvious option of ""just switch"")?",2022-01-05 01:38:14

Since I main Hanzo for 2 months now, I am asking myself why. Is Hanzo actually overpowered? 

To be honest, it's no difficulty for me to land headshots (especially with Sonic Arrow). Even when I miss the head I just need one more bodyshot. With my storm arrows on the other hand I can easily destroy tanks, since I played Doom a lot I am also even doing some rollouts and nice escapes with his high mobility. In addition to that I am able to build my dragon very quickly. 

Since all these streamers are at least above Grandmasters I think they have to be right. He has to be op when even Pro players are complaining about his abilities right? Is it just hate or is it a fact?",2022-01-05 09:29:47

This game is similar but yet very different in a lot of ways. We play solely QP. 

Coming from a game like league where solo-carrying is almost an every game possibility from a player, this game seems a lot more team reliant and a lot less of solo-carry potential. Like sure you can play well but I feel like it‚Äôs the team that wins the game here, not the individual. 

I‚Äôm asking basics for what to do In certain situations, when to group, when to ult, when to yolo in there for some random kills? 

May be a stupid question but idk this game seems a lot more structured than most league games wish to be and we end up getting lost on what to do sometimes.

I want to preface this by saying that I‚Äôm a longtime hamster owner irl, so Hammond always had a special place in my heart. That‚Äôs a big part of why I‚Äôm so upset about this. I loved playing Hammond because of his unique mobility. Sure the spinning ball can be annoying at times but there are plenty of counters to it (ie Cassidys flashbang,  Sym turrets, Hogs hook). And yeah,  Hammond requires ‚Äúmore skill‚Äù now but what if I wasn‚Äôt playing him to develop skill? I loved playing him because he was a ridiculous character and fun to play, not so I can become a god tier gamer or something. I‚Äôm a very casual and not super skilled player so playing Hammond made the game and tank class a lot more accessible to me. I don‚Äôt play overwatch so I can become a pro gamer, I play it so I can relax and unwind. Now that Hammonds grapple is weak he‚Äôs become borderline unplayable for me. The whole point of him is that he‚Äôs an easy target when he‚Äôs on the ground and now since he‚Äôs forced to spend more time on the ground he gets killed extremely easily. Also he‚Äôs become useless for holding objectives. I don‚Äôt think he was ever particularly overpowered.

I Get that a good widow can pop heads like grapes, but so can hanzo, and I know she has the advantage of hitscan but if I'm being honest past low level any good hanzo compensates for that and if you ask me the difference is null. maybe I'm wrong it just seems like shes not as viable.

Overwatch,2022,1,"Basically, Because armor reduces damage by 50% from (non beam) attacks that deal 10 or below damage and characters such as Dva or Ball or pretty much all other dive characters deal damage in small tick amounts, The amount of damage reduced by armor plus the amount of health healed by inspire causes 50 armor to last longer than 100 health

Ex.  (Amended) Hypothetically a Brig is constantly being shot by ball with a constant dps output of 125 damage per second

50 Armor with 15 Health per second will last roughly 1.05 Seconds

100 Health with 15 Healing will last roughly .8 Seconds.",2022-01-07 08:14:51
Overwatch,2022,1,"Looking over the latest patch, I‚Äôm kind of disappointed in almost all the changes (except the Moira one), they just seem unnecessary. I think Blizzard had some really cool options that just got swept aside like:

- Zarya alt fire knock back was kind of cool. I think the mobility would have been a welcome tool, without making her overpowered. It sounded goofy at first, but ended up growing on me.

- Mei‚Äôs ice skate was a ‚Äúcool‚Äù bonus for an otherwise low-mobility hero. I don‚Äôt think it would have broken her because I don‚Äôt see shooting the floor for a small speed boost as a real combat option.

- Crouch to fast fall on Pharah was cool. I can see how it might have been too much mobility, but I like the idea of encouraging falling to cover or closing distance over the noob trap of floating out in the open.

- Torb hammer change was hilarious! I think the 2-tap in overload was overkill, but dealing 75 damage a swing doesn‚Äôt seem that unreasonable when he already has a shotgun. Instead they just made his shotgun better.

- The Moira cleanse effect was an interesting way to make up for her seeming lack of utility and I hoped it was going to be explored further. While I don‚Äôt dislike the jump boost, I don‚Äôt think it addresses the issue she has in organized play right now with only being a compelling pick for a very specific game plan.

I see a lot of people panning the changes, and I kind of agree. I really just wanted the above changes and am disappointed with the direction they chose. Maybe there‚Äôs another patch coming soon?",2022-01-07 08:31:54

In my personal opinion, the game is in a mediocre unbalanced state. It‚Äôs still definitely fun to play, but I find myself turning off the game much more quickly than I used to. 

Combat is becoming slightly stale, as we have no new releases until overwatch 2 (except for deathmatch maps, but I mean cmon, really?)

The content creator patch notes was awesome, and I‚Äôd love to see more stuff like that.

Overwatch,2022,1,"I started playing this game again, a couple years ago I had a fairly regular group to play comp with and we would do okay, we were placed in plat and the matches seemed really competitive and that added the fun. I lost that group due to people just finding other interests so I stopped playing for a bit.

Anyway I keep coming back to this game as I love it but playing solo queue in comp I was only ever ranked high silver and no matter how well I tried I would never rise up out of the pit of depression that is silver matches. Its mainly people who don't know what they are doing (fair enough for newer players) or people who just have fun with being toxic and griefing, also smurfs.

Anyway I just placed gold in support (2008sr which I'm thinking is low gold) and I'm pretty pleased.
My question is if I have a run of bad luck and bad matches (that can happen in solo queue a lot) will I get dropped back down to the bowels of silver rank? Or do I just get stuck at low gold?",2022-01-07 15:38:19

Overwatch,2022,1,"Nerfs should happen when something about a hero is inherently broken or unfair: Sombra contesting while invisible, for example, was unfair because it had little to no counter play and was free value for low effort. That is not the case with grapple time. Why? because spin to win is NOT, as many seem to think, free infinite contest time because it has PLENTY of counter play. Because There are already many abilities across all the roles that can de-grapple ball, so there was no need to force this. Letting a ball spin for more than 5 seconds isn't the game's fault; it's you and your team's fault for not utilizing the ample cc that could have stopped it. 

Regular abilities that already de-grapple ball: Hog hook, Rein charge, Sig rock, flash-bang, Junk trap, hack, Doom punch, Mei freeze, Mei wall (doesn't de-grapple but stops the spin), Sleep dart, Brig bash. Many of which take little to no skill in order to land. There are even a number of ults that will do the job, though you usually shouldn't need to because of the long list of regular abilities above. 

It's discouraging to see the devs go this direction when ample counters already exist. It shouldn't really change how ball is played at higher levels because of all the cc anyway, but it highlights a long running issue where heros with a high pick rate are nerfed themselves rather than addressing the reason for their high pick rate related to the current game state. In the case of Ball, he had a high pickrate among tanks just because he actually had survivability compared to other tanks. It isn't that ball is inherently strong, it's that the amount of power creep in this game is insane among dps and supports who can manipulate damage output, making most other non-mobile tanks just feel like ass to play. People didn't play him becasue he was good, they played him because he could actually play the game. But now what the devs see is ""ball can contest disproportionately long compared to others, especially in low ranks, therefore nerf ball. This small picture thinking is bad for balance. 

If this were OW2 where presumably a lot of cc will be removed, then I'd get this change, but save it for when the live game actually has low enough cc to justify the built in de-grapple. As it is, there was no reason for his due to the multitude of built in counters.",2022-01-07 17:46:32

Overwatch,2022,1,"Thanks for spending the time in reading my question, it means a lot for higher SR players in helping a mid gold player out. So before you ask, I'm not that player who knows nothing about overwatch, I understand positioning, using your kit effectively is very, very important, and not brainlessly walking into the enemy team trying to 1v6 them and wasting you're ana sleep or nade every time it's not on cooldown. I'm a paid member of Game leap, I watch ML7, Karq, and other YouTube video guides, so it's not like I don't understand and play the game for a quick break. I'm a very competitive player, so competitive that I don't play competitive that much. I got competitive anxiety because of that. I got a friend that's in Diamond, and I've even played against a few diamond players and high plats and the Diamond DPS said I was good. Maybe i just play alot more competitive and i will climb.

&amp;#x200B;

Now before someone comments, if you're in gold that's because you're a gold player. I don't play comp that much, so it's not like I play like 300 games per season, its more like 10-20. As I'm on console, I really need advice. I'm a good mercy and bap player, but ana is really hard to use as I'm on console. But i do go for agro nades, save my sleep and deal dps when my team are healed. So its not like im a bad ana player, but because im on console, maybe change the support to someone that will get more value because of that??

&amp;#x200B;

I often look for groups and do a 6 man. But i feel that by doing this I'm playing against harder players or players in a group. So is it best to go solo. I have around 100h in comp, but nearly 300 in quickplay. I understand QP gives you bad techniques and competitive is the way to go. Do i just suck it up and jump into comp. I don't have the confidence when i'm playing comp because im so scared of losing SR. I'm a player that wants to learn and climb through the ranks, any comments that are aiming at this I really, really do appreciate your help and time. :)

Overwatch,2022,1,"When I first started playing competitive I tried hard to climb the ranks and dedicated a lot of time to learning tactics and skills. 

I started in silver and climbed to plat. 

Then I realized something. I found it less fun to climb the ranks on account of increased toxicity as well as the emotional roller coaster as the games got more intense. I got upset more often than I would have liked. 

So I got a new account and used it to try heroes I wouldn't have dared to in higher ranks and ranked in silver. And eventually made it down to bronze. 

Yeah I know, I know. You don't try new heroes in ranked. Honestly, It's one thing to use an existing account to do this because your team suffers. But with a new account, if you are using new heroes from the get go before you can even do your placements in competitive, you're going to be ranked with others at your same skill level. So you're not doing anyone a disservice when you play ranked with new heroes this way. 

Anyway, afterplaying in bronze, I'll tell you what, these games are WAY more fun. The random chaos you witness on a regular basis is hilarious! 

I find myself getting angry far less and I find it much more enjoyable. I don't take it as seriously. I'll still play to win, but it's so much easier to let things roll off my back when they happen. I'll find myself saying, ""only in bronze could that have happened."" cause you'll always find enemies out of position in the most random places, you'll get caught by an ult because they did something stupid that caught you off guard, or maybe there was a happy accident that wouldn't have happened if the player were more skilled. 

It keeps you on your toes, but also adds humor to the game play. 

And on top of that, people don't rage on you (as often) when you make a stupid mistake. Or when they do rage and tell you how much you suck, the best response is the simplest one: ""Are we all not in bronze? We ALL suck!""

Anyone else in bronze feel the same way?",2022-01-08 15:24:48

if you kill a damage hero, the enemy team will have 2 healers, 1 damage, and 1 tank. the pick significantly reduces enemy team damage output. if the tank is holding space with a healer helping, that leaves one person to do heavy damage to your team. the other healer might pocket the damage hero but your team would have more cover and defense to counter it

I just think there's too many fresh accounts in gold. If 1 of 12 players is a legit new player, it's just not fun to play. If they're on your team they either feed their face off or don't contribute meaningfully. If they're on the other team it's like playing 6v5.

If anyone has other ideas for clearing freshies out of gold I'd love to hear it.",2022-01-09 01:34:47
Overwatch,2022,1,"I just had a game where one of my teammates complained about the healers. Since I was a healer that game and doing my best, I got annoyed. To make things worse, I healed the complainer at least twice but got no acknowledgement.

Since I was still annoyed, I asked both teams to thank their healers after the game. Two people promptly told me to shut up, saying they got no heals whatsoever.

People not thanking their healers is my biggest pet peeve in Overwatch, and this is coming from a Reaper main. I make an effort to thank my healers every time, and I wish more people would do the same.",2022-01-09 01:42:46

Overwatch,2022,1,"So I play on PS4, and for the past month-ish, my chat has bugged out. If I join a group too fast, we queue into a game or dm too fast, someone joins my group, literally anything, and my chat bugs out, where on my friend's ends it looks like I left the chat, but for me, their voices cut, they can't hear me, I can't hear them, and I have to completely restart my game. The only way I've found to avoid this, it to make a playstation party then add the people that join (cause I usually play with a couple biddies of mine, and we like 6-stacking), then if they're not up to snuff, kick them then remove them from my friends list, but I have an awful memory, so I'd just forget.
I tried contacting Blizzard, but nothing went through, so I figured Reddit was the next best option. Idk what to do cause it's pissing me off that I can't play one of the only games I (somewhat, lol) enjoy playing. 

Other than shit talking someone who started bitching and moaning, cause I killed him (an ashe) as Mercy one time, then he had to have a pocket to spawn camp me and called me a fag, trash, that I was a shit Mercy, and told me to kill myself (his other DPS friend joining in too), I can't think of any reason why my chat would be doing this. And I wasn't even being toxic, I was just saying ""lol stay mad"" cause he was getting so heated.

Overwatch,2022,1,"Since there‚Äôre barely any new lores now. I wonder what next Archive skins could be. The Archive skins from 2021 was the weakest of all since they had nothing to do with the Overwatch lore, what‚Äôs worse is that those heroes who earned the skins, had already received Archive skins previously.

Here are the following heroes who had zero Legendary skins for Archive.

* **Tank:** DVA, Reinhardt, Sigma, Wrecking Ball
* **Damage:** Echo, Symmetra
* **Support:** Brigitte, Zenyatta

‚ÄãAll I can think of Scientist Sigma as we saw in his trailer before his experiment went wrong.

How could DVA get an Archive skin, since she‚Äôs very young.  
How could Reinhardt get an Archive Legendary skin, as his Crusader is literally his lore skin.  
I guess the only ideas would their fresh recruit days that they used standard MEKA / Crusader armor before they customized or redesigned them into new look based on their likings.  
(Younger age with shorter, amazing-looking blonde hair + beardless Reinhardt?)

Both Symmetra &amp; Zenyatta had no lore updates until Symmetra short story came. At the same time, Symmetra got a lore event skin.

Brigitte &amp; Wrecking Ball didn‚Äôt have any new lores. Despite Brigitte was presented in animated shorts &amp; comic, Reinhardt was the main spotlight. Brigitte didn‚Äôt serve much impact compared to Zenyatta in Symmetra‚Äôs short story.

Since Echo is the latest hero, I don‚Äôt mind having her skipped until Anniversary. Perhaps, a field test / practice training bot where she‚Äôs deployed in testing courses.",2022-01-09 09:36:46

Overwatch,2022,1,"Hey, I have no idea what's going on with my game. It felt that way for the better part of a year or so and while I used to be a master/gm player I can barely get out of diamond now. My ping is 55 max when I play the game yet everything doesn't feel as smooth as it should be, my shots don't hit, people peak me before I see them, I get shot at when I shouldn't, things like this and it's driving me crazy, I have no idea what it is. I've been gaming for 20 years and I have what I think are good gaming troubleshooting basics. The things I've tried:

* Disconnecting all users from my network except my PC, ethernet ofc
* Closing all background applications (except Avira, never gave me issues in the past)
* Jitter test - around 3-5ms, 450 down 55 up
* I have a GTX 1080 - Trying all different nvidia reflex options. I also play on low graphics and get around 300 fps with 60-65 degree temps
* Limit packet sending and receiving, but my inputs don't really register as ball
* Buying a new keyboard/mouse
* High precision mouse input on/off, I typically have it on when I play on US servers and off when I play on EU servers to compensate for ping, that seems to help
* All the xbox crap off
* Using exitlag to find different routes
* The game is on an NVMe
* Probably more things that I can't think of right now

What I don't understand is the constant, and I mean constant network notification symbol on the left side of the screen.
