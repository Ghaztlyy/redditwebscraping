You have arrived in Teyvat — a fantasy world where the seven elements flow and converge.

In the distant past, the Archons granted mortals unique elemental abilities. With the help of such powers, people formed a bountiful homeland out of the wilderness. However, 500 years ago, the collapse of an ancient civilization turned the universe upside down...Though the calamity the world suffered has ceased, peace has yet to be restored.

You, as the main character, are a traveler drifted from another world who has awoken in this land. You will explore this wondrous world freely, make friends along the way, and look for ""The Seven"" — Archons of the seven elements. Every piece of your adventure will unearth something miraculous, and the lost will eventually be found.

Genshin_Impact,2020,2,He does that in the manga prologue. Even if it's time limited would be nice to have this skill.,1582817876
Genshin_Impact,2020,2,"While watching IGN's sneak peak at the beta build, I realised that it would be absolutely AMAZING if GI had a mount system, and a housing system.

 I'd love to be able to either buy basic mounts or tame them from the wilderness. Even just purchasing horses from a stablemaster near the city would be nice, but Mihoyo could also gain extra revenue by selling unique mount skins as well. It would make travelling more fun and immersive.

And a housing system, say, we do enough quests in a region or finish the main quest-line, we should be able to unlock an npc that can sell you a property within or near one of the cities/ towns for a price. Then we can buy and decorate our houses, and I don't even mind if the decorations would be from a cash shop.

 And like, this doesn't have to be a thing that exists at launch. It could always be implemented later on as a DLC or expansion.",1582823601
Genshin_Impact,2020,2,"Will there be Microtransactions? Or a buy to play?

&amp;#x200B;

《Genshin Impact》as a free to download online game, will adopt the more mature Microtransactions design method in the current market. In this open world game travelers may get what they desire through exploring the world, gacha system, participating events etc. We'll be improving the way to gain contents as well and bring a better experience for the gamers.

Genshin_Impact,2020,2,I’m not saying it’s the best mobile game ever created but from the gameplay we have seen it just looks like a 60 dollar game... miyoho has come far from honkai which launched with very few content and they updated it to the point where it was huge but even that game isn’t as deep as genshin impact which has a gigantic open world real time physics and a big story... on top of this mutiplayer with dungeons and bosses... idk I’ve never seen a mobile game this big well eh gta games have come to mobile and I guess they are larger but I mean mobile original games not ports. I think miyoho has a bright future in the gaming industry and I think genshin impact will sell like muffins,1582882138

&gt;**Q9: Can I share my Closed Beta Test account with others?**  
&gt;  
&gt;It is strictly prohibited to share, buy or sell your account. Distributing the Closed Beta Test account (or any other related) information may result in the termination of your account. Please do not trust any third party or individual claiming that they are able to provide close beta test accounts. We also encourage you to keep your private data safe to prevent your account from being stolen.

It is also formally stated in the [terms of service](https://genshin.mihoyo.com/en/company/terms). Therefore, any post involved in the sharing or trading of CBT2 accounts shall be removed.

Besides, as stated in the email sent to beta testers, **it's necessary to note that you can log in your test account on only ONE device; you are NOT supposed to change to another device (i.e. log in your account on any device other than the one where you logged in for the first time**). Otherwise, your account may be banned. This is probably a countermeasure to the aforementioned practices of account sharing/trading.",1584000224

Genshin_Impact,2020,3,"So they havent made this very widely known that I can tell so I thought I would put a post here. On the discord in Technical-help there is a pinned message about contacting someone who can help you out. but as someone who had the same issue and went through that process (which was great by way) here is what it was for me. 

When you log into your account within the game make sure you are logging in using your Username not your email. If you linked a username in your account and it does not work in the game try using just the part of your email before the @ symbol. 

for example if your email is user1233@gmail then use only user1233 to log into the game. 

Hopefully this helps everyone, if not go to the discord get all set up with access to the CBT channels and use the pinned message in Technical-help to talk with someone whoc an help you get it situated.",1584980304

Genshin_Impact,2020,3,"Hi everyone,

I recently joined Genshin Impact's CBT2, I have more than 20 hours of gameplay to date, but I really wonder about the level up mechanics... I didn't use a single adventurer advice in the first region, I explored it all and reached the end of the prologue in the northwest area with all my characters level 10. And then I encountered monsters level 30+ and I had to level up using the adventurer scrolls.

Now my characters are level 20, I ascended them but when I try the Wolf Quest (adventurer level 21) I meet again monsters with a huge level and I have again to use the scrolls to level up again...

Am I doing something wrong? I explored EVERY corner of Mondstadt, did all the quests, but now leveling with simple monster bashing is taking longer than the last level of any MMORPG. It feels really counter intuitive to level up with the scrolls, it feels like I have to constantly managing the difficulty of the game myself.

Any advice? Thanks and good game !",1585313499

Genshin_Impact,2020,3,"Hi everyone.

I've been playing the 2nd closed beta for like 30+hrs now and I'm amazed at the content the beta has. The 2 regions are really huge and it makes me ask myself if they will really succeed in making 7 distinct regions this huge.

 In the end the world would be much bigger than Zelda Breath of the Wild but most importantly it would be much denser. I played Zelda a lot and there were a lot of wild areas with only plains and trees. Even though some places are similar in Genshin Impact it feels like the world is much more filled, there are just dozens of interesting places that you can get a glance at by just looking around. And the second region is just better than anything I've seen in Zelda.

We know by the lore and the website there are indeed 7 elements within 7 archons but is it confirmed there will be 7 regions as big as the first 2? It would be just mind blowing.",1585587746

Genshin_Impact,2020,5,"  I have a brother who plays fighting games. He and I have been looking at all the characters fighting styles and I thought I would share some of our thoughts that we were bouncing around. This list comprises of just general-ish impressions we had based on how we saw them fight. We aren't sure what and how elemental advantages play a part. We did look at their speed, spells, and tried to analysis on how Great/Average/Weak each character is. WIthout further ado...


**Good as a Solo**

1. Noelle*

  Me: Although character has a slower attack speed, she more than makes up for it in a wide hit box. This allows her to be able to handle a crowded room. Her crystal spell seems to serve the purpose of protect (of some kind) which makes it easier to deal with close range enemies. Hit box is able close to mid-range enemies. 


  Bro: AOE is AMAZING! The ONLY character to have a shield to help with defense. Damage output did not seem that low, it fact it seemed rather high. And although her speed was slow, her abilities help compensate for those weaknesses, which is rare among the characters given. I honestly don’t see many weaknesses with her except for fighting fast opponents, as well as ranged


2. Xiao*

  Me: Xiao is a very fast moving character with potential to help finish a weakened large group of 1v1 due to his main spell having a moderately big AOE. Best to fight in an enclosed area so that he can use AOE spell to weaken enemies. Range attacks would be an issue due to the limited range of his attacks, however speed aids in closing any gaps. Best to avoid enemies that can cause his speed to drop. 


  Bro:Fastest character in the game both combos as well as abilities, Like Joker (smash ultimate), his abilities have great speed, and when transformed his damage becomes amplified, WITHOUT losing speed. I feel he does Razors job, but with better speed and fewer risks. Reaction speed is very crucial with him, if you cannot keep up with his speed you will be taking more damage than giving. Ranged opponents could also be a weakness for him. 


3. Beidou

  Me:Great hit box, Close to mid-range enemies are ideal because her sword is long enough to make up for the distance. Can handle a large crowd of enemies. Ideal would be to fight in an enclosed space to make sure that attacks hit enemies within it’s range. Her spells would be ideal for a single hard hitting enemies due to being able to counter the attack



  Bro: THE ONLY CHARACTER WITH A COUNTER! Speed was faster than the average two-handed sword wielder, with exceptional damage to compensate. A weaker version of Noelle, but instead of high defense abilities she has more counter abilities. Has to be careful when engaging, and understand the timing of her abilities otherwise you can be caught by a crowd of enemies without a way of evasion. 


4. Barbara


  Me: Although she leaves much to be desired as a combative force. It is always necessary to have a healer. 


  Bro: Constant healing abilities, which seemed to be few among the characters given. She is decent with attacks but her healing is what makes this character both rare and useful for ANY team combos. She cannot do much damage herself, so when it comes to her defeating enemies she isn’t useful AT ALL. 


5. Lisa

  Me:Like most ranged characters, every attack pushes them further away from the enemy. Lisa is able to combo her spells to create a danger field to keep her safe (lower defense). Great for taking one several enemies.


  Bro: Range compared to other ranged is better, better AOE, not great attack speed but good for “character combos”. Also great at spacing opponents while damaging them. Not many weaknesses.


6. Xiangling

  Me:Her fast attacks can make clearing out a camp very fast while her main fire spell can help prevent her from getting hit by surrounding enemies. Great for several enemies. Would recommend not using main fire spell around grass or else she has very little room to move.


  Bro: Great AOE damage with both her attacks and her “dummy” summon. Good speed for evasion or making distance between enemies. Biggest weakness would be ranged opponents 


**Middle Ground**


1. MC

  Me:Best for a single target due to not having a wide AOE or hit box with attacks. Spells can bring in enemies but MC would take a while in handling a group (not say they can’t). I would say MC would go first in a hard battle however, as a second they can help in persistent attacks to lower HP of enemy.


  Bro:Very balanced character. Has decent rage attacks, decent AOE abilities, decent range. The highlight of this character is it is the only one I saw that had multiple elemental abilities (one wind and the other earth). Weaknesses can be ranged opponents, and large enemies. 


2. Jean

  Me: More of a hard hitter than MC in terms of Air spells can help if overwhelmed by a crown of enemies. Can managed in a crowd of enemies, not fast enough to clear out a field.


  Bro: A very average character. Not as fast a Xing. Not the best Melee. Not much AOE attacks. A weaker version of the MC. 

3. Razor

  Me: Doesn’t appear to hit very harder despite the speed advantage. The spells may help in adding more attacks along with his speed. Razor has more benefits in combat than Diluc due to speed, but has the same disadvantages that Diluc has. 


  Bro: Faster than Diluc and faster than other two handed handlers (minus Beidou). Has spells that can amplify his attacks which can make up for the lack of damage. Fast opponents can be a problem, however ranged opponents can be a problem with him. 


4. Klee

  Me: Klee has good range in the fact that she is able to throw her fire balls at enemies and good AOE. Battle area space doesn’t matter. Best for a crowd of enemies because 1v1 would be a waste of the AOE potential of her attacks. Not best for enemies who are close range and possible hit hard, assuming her defense isn’t remarkable.



  Bro: Great AOE, good room of enemies, a good distance fighter, doesn’t seem to be able to be able to deal with enemies that can close the distance between her. As well that she has an extreme weakness if there is an elemental immunity. 


5. Bennette

  Me: Has the tools to handle a crowd of enemies. His speed will help hit more attacks, his spells can either be pushed for a single enemy, aid in evasion, or take on many enemies. Can’t fight with grass around. Wide AOE. 



  Bro: A very average/basic melee fighter. He has charged moves which (presumably) will be able to do a large amount of damage to either a single enemy, or a very small group. Ranged fighters will definitely give him a hard time along with mobile opponents. Arial opponents will also be a problem for him. 


6. Amber

  Me: Best in a open space because she benefits from the range of attacking her enemies. Her spells seem to serve the purpose of putting distance between herself and enemies. Spells have an okay hit box thus making her able to take on a smallish group of enemies. The puppet bomb can give her time to create distance and redirect enemy attack. Best to go first since she has range to hit enemies. 


  Bro: Decent; no great strength or weakness, she has good range, decent are of effect. Weaknesses would be enemies with high speed that could engage in close combat with her


**Good for Combos**

1. Diluc

  Me: Seems to hit harder than Xiang, but not as fast as her. The slow mobility makes ii harder for him to fight multiple enemies. Not good for a large group of ranged hitter because he doesn’t have the means of shortening the gap. Has a spin attack that might aid in closing gaps. Best for 1v1 or enemies that attack at close range. If a strong boss that isn’t ranged hitting, second would suit for the purpose of lowering Boss HP.


  Bro: Slower mobility that can only be offset by higher attack. Lack of a wide AOE can only be offset by a higher defense. 


2. Venti

  Me: Has the tools to handle a crowd of enemies. His speed will help hit more attacks, his spells can either be pushed for a single enemy, aid in evasion, or take on many enemies. I can see him being able to hold his own against faster opponents. Disadvantage would be another ranged fighter with a wide hit box. 


  Bro: Fast range but his damage output may not be enough. So he can evade and hit, but may take a while to actually kill. He may do best at lowering HP (constant hits), not killing enemy (a few strong hits).


3. Ninggliang

  Me: This character is best with distance due to spells targeting one enemy at a time. Her slower attack speed gives her a disadvantage if an enemy is faster than her. Not good for confined space, best in an open setting. Enemies who are not beyond “the gate” may occur giving her a disadvantage. Best for 1v1, not recommended for a group. Although her AOE, perhaps having her switch out between a character who is able to handle a large crowd is ideal. She is can damage enemies up close but not too close. Only ranged Geo element user.


  Bro: The ONLY ranged earth mage seen, that makes her valuable for that only reason. Her range didn’t seem to do an exceptional damage, Damage in fact is only affect if it passes through her wall, so mobile opponents as will give her a hard time. 


4. Fischl

  Me: Worst range, Amber as a taunt that can bring enemies in while negating attacks. The transformation of turning into a bird seems to serve the purpose of attacking while in the air or creating distance from the enemies. 


  Bro: Worst ranged mage, her transforming into a bird brings her into contact with opponents which is the opposite of what she is supposed to do. She doesn’t have great AOE abilities, fragile and not very mobile (except her bird form which again brings her into contact with her opponents).

5. Kaeya

  Me: Like Xiao, send this character in last due to speed and attacks suited to kill enemies faster. Has spell that can aid in attacking enemies that are too close. Not good AOE. Not best for a crowd of enemies due to not great AOE, best for taking on a 1v1 enemy whom he can attack quickly while evading. A confined space is best due to not having ranged attacks.


  Bro: Any other character can do what he does; combo heavy (Beidou), speed (Xiao), not much range attacks, smallish AOE.



6. Xingqui

  Me: This character has move sets that allow them to do extra damage to close enemies using spells. Best for a 1v1 setting due to the moderate attack speed and bad AOE of attacks (and spells). Wouldn’t do well with ranged enemies or a large crowd. Good combo character best to work with Kaeya who can freeze enemies. 


  Bro: Worse than Kaeya, better suited for character combo than stand alone. Unless his attack output is substantial, then the fight would take a while due to not having any spells that have a wide AOE or range. 



Character Combo= This character could possible work well if switched with others. For example Kaeya (ice) and Xingqui (water).


*=Fave


 
So yes, there are the general impressions. These impressions don't take into account elemental advantage or disadvantage but merely how they characters fights. I didn't add Ayaka because I didn't see her on the official website, so perhaps she will be ""Coming Soon"" so we can look at her moves along with others. I think one of the bigger issues we had was that may of the character feel the same. The Top 6 seemed like the only characters that had something special or at the very least discerning. Xianggling was ""great"" enough because of speed, MC could be ""great"" if we understood how well she can use other elements (we saw a video where she used Geo and Wind spells), Amber was saved from being ""weak"" due to being balanced, and Diluc is ""weak"" most because of his speed (although if he has very higher attack of defense stats then he would be mid-average).

Before Ulti: ""Hello, I am useless maid-knight, that have very small heal if conselation is unlocked, i can lower elemental damage of enemies, but this will lower elemental damage of the team as well, mostly supporting physical damage teams"".

When Ulti is up: ""Hello, I am your top DPS after Xiao and Klee, but only for a few seconds"".

**Xiao**:

""I can help you to travell the world with my dashes"".

""I can do a lot of damage with my dashes and can be any element I consumed"".

During Ulti: ""Have you seen me criting with dive kick for 9 million damage and oneshotting enemies 500 levels above?""

**Beidou**:

""Back at ya!""

Fast swap-counter, and no one can hurt you anymore. And obviously ulti for electricity for combos on other characters.

**Barbara**:

""Lets dance!""

""Now you are healed and Kaeya can permafreeze""

**Lisa**:

""Ara-ara\~""

""You set up some fire and obstacles for my skills? I will setup some ulti for you, cutie""

**Xiangling**:

""Is this eadible?""

Spinning axe and charge attack for the most cases.

**Traveller**:

""I can build, I can blow!""

**Jean**:

""I can do medium dps, but during me dpsing whole team is getting healed. And I have ow-shit button on ulti to save from enemies""

**Razor**:

""My DPS during ulti is very huge, if there any Pyro characters there""

**Klee**:

""I am a God mage/ranged DPS and my damage is explosion, not just fire, so rip any shields, I am one girl army, just bring me some electricity with Lisa/Beidou Ulti or permanent Fischl Raven""

**Bennett**:

""I can heal and buff your damage, while doign decent damage, if you don't have any other healer or supporter""

**Abmer**:

""Go-go Baron Bunny, let mobs hit you and not the beacon in Spiral Abyss!""

**Diluc**:

""Have you seen my insane damage combo with AA AA SKill AA AA Skill AA AA Skill AA Ulti? Everything is obliterated to ashes!""

**Venti**:

""Hey, I am support than can pull all enemies in one spot and as bonust to outdps other Archers, a bit of cheating from the God of wind""

**Ningguang**:

""Hi! I am mage with Geo attack! What do you mean Geo is not interracting with anything, so it is useless?! How about my shield from ranged attacks! What do you mean enemies are spawning from all 4 sides in Abyss? Developers, I need some love!""

**Fischl**:

""Oh, hi, I can make your Klee not just god dps, but even outdps Xiao! Impossible, I know! And I can do some nice dps on my own.""

**Kaeya**:

""Oh hi, enemies hurting you? Welcome to the permafreeze team with Xingqui and Barbara. No one ever can hurt you again. Oh ye, and I can do decent dps as well, with Icebreaker set, I can self heal and I have defensive passive on low HP.""

**Xingqui**:

""I can be really good dps, but my swords can make any of your melee/spear characters a godlike dps, and swords can heal and reduce damage as well! Just swap to get my godly buffs time to time!""

**Teams**:

1. Godlike **survivability**, very decent damage and chilling gameplay: Kaeya as dps. Supports: Barbara + Xingqui + Beidou. Nothing ever can hurt you, everything that can be frozen is permafreezed, and dps is pretty good. Thanks for Remilia for sharing this team on forums, it saved me a lot of nerves in Spiral Abyss. Do not forget to proc Supercharged to lower enemy defenses. And to alterate Barbara heal and Xingqui swords, to always have Hydro around.
2. Godlike **damage**: Xiao as dps. Xingqui as support. Rest can be filled with Jean, Barbara, MC, Beidou, Fischl, Bennett, Amber - depending on your needs. Insane damage during ulti, decent damage otherwise. Just spam jump+attack during ulti. Very versatile team as can be used for any content, and because Xiao is Anemo (wind), he can consume any elemental buff and become that element DPS. So Bennett ulti will make Xiao a fire DPS, for example. Best AoE dps in the game.
3. Godlike **ranged damage**: Klee as dps. Lisa or Fischl as support/dps (can take Beidou, but she is worse in consistent Electro buff for Klee, plus need to get into melee range). Bennett as support buffer/heal to buff Fire damage to insane values. And last slot to your liking. More safe team, and very good on killing shields and tanky enemies, good for single targets and on setuping the battle field.
4. Godlike **best team**: your waifu/husbando + 3 characters to support them.

Good luck getting into CBT3 boys and girls. Also heres bonus fact:

* Even if you've already registered and were part of any previous CBT, you are not guarenteed a access and will have to sign up again for CBT3!

The following post was made before the CBT3 announcement:

With another beta test probably coming up, I thought I'd compile all the information I was able to gather into one place to help people. I'll start out by saying I've actually never played Genshin, but I work remotely at home and have been listening to lots of streams and videos about game info in general from different content creators. I've also played a LOT of gacha games in my life.

Most of this information is from [Demone Kim](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCp76b_m_wL_Mb5SFuDQlUsg), who was in the top 3 highest level players in the CBT2, and his hours of QnA streams (which are still going, but at this point he's just being repeatedly asked the same questions). That being said, I feel Demone is quite the hype beast, doesn't have much experience when it comes to gacha games in general, and seems very overoptimistic about Genshin Impact. This doesn't take away from his hundreds of hours in the game however, and he still has a lot of insight about the game as a whole and his chill personality makes him a joy to watch. I suggest following him, as he's going to be gearing is content heavily towards Genshin.

**All of this information should taken with a grain of salt as they are all hearsay from CBT. Things are bound to change or just be outright incorrect.** 

Now, in no particular order:

* Pick up everything. EVERYTHING. Flowers, fruits, mats. You WILL need them later and you WILL regret not picking them up. Be careful when opening up your world to co-op as guests can steal your flowers, which you may need to advance your characters later.

* Normal chests and resources respawn daily, but rarer chests such as exquisite chests are 1-time opens (you'll know which chests are which). Be careful who you let in your world, as other people may join just to steal your flowers.

* Exploration does matter and is very rewarding. There are a lot of weapons, equipment, and materials that can be gathered and there is a lot to explore. If something seems even slightly suspicious in any sense, investigate it.

* Inventory space was big in the beta (to the point where it was pointless). Might not be the same upon release and may be one way to monetize

* According to Demone the game is super F2P, which is a contradicting claim since he also mentions we don't even know what 'endgame' is yet since the beta only had 2 of the 3 planned areas the game will launch with. Games will usually always start out seemingly F2P until more content starts rolling out.

* Try to level up your adventurer rank (adventurer rank can be compared to 'account/global level/rank' in most games) quickly as it is tied to your stamina bar. The game gets a lot funner with a bigger stamina bar.

* That being said, you will actually get the chance advance the difficulty of your world upon hitting certain adventurer ranks. although you will get better loot drops after your world levels up, the enemies may get a lot harder to deal with. Make sure you are prepared for the difficulty jump.

* Upon your adventurer rank leveling up, you may get a stamina restore item. Remember to use these if you ever get stuck with slow stamina.

* As of CBT2, the gacha rates seem very low, but actual numbers were hidden so no one is sure. In the CBT2, players were given multiple free pulls a day, which probably lead to more impressive rosters than what the game may have since we most likely won't be getting free daily pulls upon launch.

* There is a stamina system, but it's only used for money, exp, and weapon drop dungeons. Exploring your map has no restrictions and can be done indefinitely. As an added note: the weapon drop dungeons were not nearly as worth your time as the other two.

* The stamina is not consumed until the chest is open at the end of the money, exp, and weapon drop dungeon. When co-oping, each player has to use their own stamina to open this chest for themselves. No 'free runs' but you can help other people with their runs at any time it seems.

* Co-op itself is very restricted to exploring the map and dungeons (no story, no sharing chest drops). Mihoyo says this is their #1 complaint with the CBT so far and will be trying their best to expand on it.

* When soloing, you have the team of all 4 characters of your choosing. When co-oping with 1 other person, both players have a team of 2. When co-oping with 3, the host gets 2 characters while the other 2 guest players control 1. And finally, when co-oping with 3 other players, everyone only controls 1 character. This is is a very interesting way of doing co-op IMO

* The game is cross platform with everything it plans to come out on (mobile and PC for now, maybe PS4 and Switch later down the line)

* Melee characters have a harder time procing their element on targets because their normal attacks usually do not have a chance to apply it (their skills often do). Ranged does not seem to have this problem ans their normal attacks apply their element.

* The free handout characters are not trash fodder as you would expect them to be in most games. Especially powerful free characters are the Traveler and Amber.

* Try to build your team with at least one two-handed weapon user. Armored and shielded enemies may be a pain to deal with without one.

* Having at least one healer in your team will alleviate your food usage. There is currently no passive regen.

* At some point in the game the dungeons will require you to bring 2 4-person teams.

* IF we get another CBT, and you signed up for it, MAKE SURE TO CHECK YOUR SPAM FOLDER IN YOUR E-MAIL. A lot of people missed out on the CBT2 because their invite went straight to spam and they didn't check it.

* There seemed to have been a bug or issue in the CBT2 where if you didn't use the console you initially booted your account with (mobile or PC) the game would flag your account and ban you. Just for safe measures I would log in the first time on the version you will be using the most to play the game with.

* No one was able to reroll since their client was linked to their account, but the reroll process seems like a long one (30 minutes).

* For those people who are concerned if the game can run on their potato computer, remember, this game is going to be optimized for MOBILE. I think you'll be fine. Potato phones on the other hand...

* No autoplay.

* There may be 2 more elements coming. Probably dark and light, hinted by 2 blank elements in the statsheet and the manga (which probably has nothing to do with the main game story). May be more weapon types as well.

* If Genshin is played on mobile, your battery is going to be drained very quickly. You may need a battery bank.

* A housing and guild system were talked about by the developers. There was also a test run of an event during the CBT2, which players claimed to be fun, entertaining, and rewarding.

* The CBT2 mobile client was about 9GB. I'm assuming it'll only get bigger once  launch comes.

And there you have it. If you see something wrong or want to add something, feel free to comment and I will update the post. If you have any questions I'll try my best to answer it. I'd also like to tell you guys avoid Mihoyos official forums unless it's for offical posts, as it seems to have devolved into low effort shitposting by the same handful of people on a daily basis.

Edit: Fixed some grammar.

Edit2: update thanks to u/chopchord

Edit4: I'm getting a lot of contradicting claims about the mobile clients game size. u/flutterdutch says it's 5gb, while I've seen many other people say it's 9gb. I wouldn't know personally but thought I'd add it as a note.

Genshin_Impact,2020,5,"Hey there! In anticipation for the game, I’m currently in the process of making a discord for co-op/ guild groups (if the game will have guilds or clans). 

Essentially the 2 current goals of this discord is to be a main hub for guilds or a main hub for team-ups.

Goal 1: Those that want to make guilds would submit their guild names in the channel and leave a short summary of their main focus, preferences, and/or requirements of their guild (ex. Interview needed, must be active, casual, etc). These requirements and main focus is up to the creator of the guild to decide.

Users would then be able to browse through this channel full of guilds to choose which one is suited for them and shouldn’t have to worry about not knowing whether or not the guild will be a good pick for them/ him/ her.

Note: it is suggested that guild creators create an application process of sorts to keep randoms out of their guild if they wish to do so.

Goal 2: if guilds won’t exist in the game, the other plan for the discord will be make it so it’s a organized hub for team-ups/co-ops. 

Some anticipated Voice channels and chat channels will be:

Character level-up dungeon
Ascension material for weapons dungeon
Ascension material for characters dungeon
Boss dungeons

Let me know how I can make this idea better because I know we’re all tired of joining random teams and guilds that aren’t good.

2. Follow up is most of the story seemingly Paimon and the Traveler, with the other characters dropping in and out the party as we move between cities? So like is Amber going to be commenting on the journey as we go, or does she basically stay behind after a certain point?

* Awakening materials are farmable in the open world, not as much of a need to go in dungeons for it
* New characters are shown: La Sigora, as well as others
* First look at new ice character, Chong(?), he is a melee character, he has an AoE effect that stays between character swaps that will buff all ~~male~~  melee characters
* Enemies have new attacks, like an ice cage
* On the map, it was shown you had 120 moons instead of four
* New boss, a rock bull, geo type, walking on two legs, shown in the abyss
* Elemental shields are a new defense that surrounds the player, protects them from the type of element
   * Fire element shield was demonstrated, the player could walk through lit grass without taking damage
   * Based on the type of character you are using (and the enemy attacking?)
   * Every month if you clear the Abyss, you will get a unique buff for that month
* You can queue into dungeons using multiplayer to play with other users to fight harder dungeons
* Klee is likely the first banner in FCB

Genshin_Impact,2020,6,"As you might have noticed, the community name and the description have changed a bit. Going official is the fruit of my latest discussion with a representative from miHoYo. I would like to let to you know about this result at the earliest possible time for the sake of transparency.

So what will happen? The subreddit will be promoted in official channels as the official subreddit for Genshin Impact, which will bring in many newcomers (if you are one, welcome!) and help the subreddit grow. Besides, players can participate in many (reddit-exclusive) events in collaboration with miHoYo that will give you rewards such as official merchandise. There will be obviously other benefits as well after the sub goes official.

Some players might have some concerns about our moderation policy in the future. Here I must sincerely appreciate miHoYo's understanding and respect about the importance of players autonomy in our subreddit, that it should be made by the community and for the community. Therefore, **miHoYo will not bring in any mods representing the devs**. r/Genshin_Imapct is, and will always be, a community belonging to the player community.

If going official means anything for the moderation team, it can only be that we will work harder to provide a relaxed and enjoyable environment for players of the game to interact with each other and discuss about the game freely. I know this change to our subreddit may seem a bit abrupt, but feel free to give us your feedback, concerns, or suggestions in the comment section.

Thank you,

Veritas, representing the mod team

&amp;#x200B;

Genshin_Impact,2020,6,"So in the Liyue Main Scenario Quest there is one part where the game gives you 50k Moras to hire some workers, the 3 workers asks for 15k, 25k, and 20k Moras each. Obviously this adds up to 60k Moras. The last guy takes all the money and the missing debt is taken off when the worker asks you for a 清心 (a type of flower?) item to make up for the missing cost.

At the end one of the character says you can keep the change.

The fun part about this whole quest is that the game allows you to negotiate prices. Along with a happiness gauge to measure how much you've manage to piss them off by lowballing them. If you anger them too much then you end up paying full price. i think the key is to hit them at a good price while they are still happy.

So far I haven't seen negotiations at the 3rd guy yet. So it's assumed the last 20k is non-negotiable

Solving for the prices.

Watched this stream  [https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1LT4y1J7vg](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1LT4y1J7vg)

and another one that i can't recall

Basically a streamer failed Worker A (15k) with 10k offer, Another streamer got A pass with like 11800 ish so I am gonna say Worker A value is 11k

Which means to break even Worker B would be 19k.

Let's put in perspective 11k out of 15k 11/15=0.73 which means that's probably the minimum acceptable discount for workers. 25\*73%=18.25

Assuming same minimum discount woker B = 18250

Let's put that together

11000+18250+20000=49250

You make 750 moras, AMAZING. That's of course assuming worker B even takes 18250 as a price

&amp;#x200B;

Now you too can try to make a completely irrelevant amount of moras being a master negotiator.

The more effort I put into this the more I thought you are actually not suppose to turn a profit this quest.

&amp;#x200B;

Genshin_Impact,2020,6,"The ongoing fanart event accidentally exposes a moderation issue requiring more deliberation: what should be marked as NSFW, and what should not.

For context, you can check up the [Wikipedia definition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_safe_for_work), [Reddit content policy](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy), and [an interesting write-up on the issue from r/cosplaygirl (might have NSFW content)](https://www.reddit.com/r/cosplaygirls/comments/7fxwdf/mark_posts_nsfw_if_necessary/).

To put things short, there are some debates on the issue:

1. Conservative approach: Marks all kinds of contents that show a fair bit of skins (which include most swimsuits) or are a bit sexy as NSFW.
2. Moderate-conservative approach: Marks the kinds of contents that show a majority part of skins (e.g. bikini) or are clearly intended to be sexy as NSFW. (Probably the most common approach, but also the hardest to enforce.)
3. Moderate-liberal approach: Marks the kinds of contents that are close to nudity or are clearly intended to be lewd (sexually suggestive) as NSFW. (Also a popular approach.)
4. Liberal approach: Only marks borderline nudity and strongly lewd contents as NSFW.

Please understand that nudity and sexual content is prohibited in r/Genshin_Impact. &gt;!There are subs serving the rule34 function anyway.!&lt;

I believe that this is one of the issues that are better to have community intakes. Therefore, feel free to vote for the approach that you deem as the most appropriate, and/or leave your thoughts in the comment section. The voting result and community feedback will have significant impact on the final rules, which will be hopefully formulated before the end of this month.

Genshin_Impact,2020,6,"Today I was just performing my typical ~~slave labor~~ moderator duties when I was told by the General to create content to promote reddit. Thus, I thought it would only be fitting to write a guide for you all since that’s all I do.

The moderators on the official discord can be a bit confusing to get to know, since there are a lot of us. That’s why, instead of giving you an introduction to them which would be useful to that end, I’m going to give you a guide to the list of official mod ships in the server.

\#1: Nayel x Sele

This ship dates back to the Honkai Impact 3 server. These two gentlemen both hail from the land of baguettes. The moment that really established this ship was when both of them had to attend a booth for miHoYo. From reliable eye-witness testimony we can confirm that they were indeed hitting if off greatly. Fanfiction has been written about them and rumor is that they have pictures of each other on their phones.  Rumors are dys is their child.

https://preview.redd.it/970ig1hqzk651.png?width=641&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=30925cad4499463d94e62178f820d3bca1e412c2

\#2: Cer x Dys x Cer

Apparently there used to be another cer but they’re gone now. This is also an old ship that dates back to the Honkai Impact 3 server. The 2nd cer is more or less a third wheel but he grudgingly hangs onto the ship and refuses to leave.  (Apparently there is actually a 4th cer who is also gone).

\#3: Alonso x Cody

This is a new ship formed recently in the Genshin Impact server. The mom and dad of the Spanish Channel, these two buff gentlemen will hunt you down for any wrongdoing ~~as I have seen from personal experience.~~  Complete with fanart.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/2028znifyk651.png?width=480&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=05f32bfd80714a889257b7089fd06b7b7d71c904

I need ***your*** help to pair up the remaining mods. After all, nobody likes to be left out. So join our discord, see how they interact, and proclaim your ship widely and proudly and maybe one day it will be added to this list of official mod ships.

Mods remaining to be shipped: Heck if I know I don’t actually know all the mods

(Since I’m married to my job of writing essays, I’m part of the Majessay ship and will not be shipped with any mods. Thank you for your understanding.)",1592883356

If you want to help out by contributing, this would be your first place to check out. It has a to-do list for the whole wiki and guides on how to edit or create pages on Fandom. If you just have feedback (pointing out errors, suggestions, etc.) you can leave a comment on almost any page on the wiki, post here, or DM me on Discord at SleepyZeez#0001. Shout out to [Remnas](https://forums.mihoyo.com/genshin/accountCenter/postList?id=6533389) for contributing the wiki, plus [Blast](https://forums.mihoyo.com/genshin/accountCenter/postList?id=6704138) and [Bear](https://forums.mihoyo.com/genshin/accountCenter/postList?id=1119583) for providing info.

**On to the updates!**

1. For starters, All the [weapons](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Weapons) from the 2nd closed beta test have been added to the wiki. ""Weapons"" is the main page which has general information like ""Passives"", ""Base Attack Scaling"", and ""How to Obtain"". Each weapon type ([Bows](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Bows), [Catalysts](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Catalysts), [Claymores](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Claymores), [Polearms](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Polearms), and [Swords](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Swords)) has its own page which provides an overview of the weapon type and listing of all characters that can use that weapon and all weapons that belong to that type. Each weapon also has its own page with its image, base stats, and passive ranks. Most base attack growth stats are blank since the ascension levels changed for the FCBT and may change again for full release and the CN players figured out all weapons follow [one of the predetermined base attack scalings](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Weapons#Base_Attack_Scaling) which is details on the weapons page.

2. [Food](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Food) and [Potions](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Potions) pages have been created from CBT2 data, like the weapons the main page gives an overview and a table with links to all the individual item pages with their crafting recipes.

3. The [Characters](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Characters) page has been updated to separate the different types of characters (Free, Wish, Upcoming, etc.). Icons have been included for the released ones along with the weapon, element, and which region they belong to. There is also space for NPCs from the game and manga.

4. Various game system pages have been updated, notably, [Elements](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Elements) (with the new Resonance system),  [Superconduct](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Superconduct), and [Wishes](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Wishes). Superconduct got its own page since the CN players did a lot of analysis on this elemental reaction. Thanks to Blast for translating.

5. A page for the [soundtrack ](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Soundtrack)miYoHo uploaded to Youtube was created. Hopefully, that can be filled in with where in-game the songs play so you identify your favorite song without having to play through all of them.

---

To provide context, a discord event was held where participants had to manually click on an emote in the official discord server every 10 minutes that would grant them 10~100 randomly distributed points. After around 40 hours, these points were added up and the 20 participants with the highest total scores would be given a CBT key. 

Later on, a bonus ""raffle"" was implemented where 10 randomly chosen participants would also receive a CBT key.


Many of the initial concerns were regarding the ethics of ""promoting"" unhealthy behaviour, as participation in the event meant staying awake for 2+ days. The organizers have already acknowledged this criticism, so I will not be addressing this further.

The issue I'd like to bring up, however, is regarding how the winners were decided and announced to the other participants.


* The winners for the top 20 cumulative score challenge were never publicly disclosed, nor were the 10 raffle winners.

In short, anytime a winner is chosen, it **should** be disclosed exactly who they are and how they won to all participants involved. This serves as basic proof that the competition was fair and not biased. 

Some examples of this can be found in the Arknights discord where participants were randomly chosen by Shaw BOT for amazon gift cards (all winners' discord IDs were posted by the bot). As well as numerous Twitter giveaways by other games, where Twitter handles were posted publicly to assure the participants that prizes were given out fairly.  

As evidence of why this practice should be required, there are multitudes of Youtube ""scam"" giveaways where the creator would announce a giveaway but not show the selection process or the winner. This gives the creator the opportunity to choose someone they know as the winner, or simply not give out any prizes without the participants knowing. 


---

As I have followed this event closely since its implementation, I will discuss in detail why the lack of clarity is especially problematic in this case. However, my main argument has already been made, so only read on if you're interested in finding out exactly what happened.

From first glance, it's obvious that this is an event of attrition. Because of the length of the event, the 10~100 variance becomes increasingly irrelevant as the cumulative score becomes averaged out in the long run. Because of this, most dedicated participants entered with the mindset that ""as long as they can stay awake, they have a significant chance of winning"". 

With the information given at this point, they're correct in this assumption. 

It's worth noting that this event did have a live leaderboard of the top 20. As the event went on, many of the t20 users had stabilized as very few players managed to stay awake for 30+ hours. 

However, due to complaints, the organizers implemented a ""bonus damage"" system without warning around 30 hours into the event. Based on the bot developers' responses, the system was meant to function as follows:

* Current top 1-50 will not receive any bonus score in their 10~100 rolls.
* From top 51 onwards, you will receive bonus score (up to +300) along with your 10~100 roll.
* The lower your current rank is, the higher your bonus score will be on average.

And most importantly,

* A check is in place to ensure that someone from below top 20 will never be able to enter the current top 20 due to a bonus score.


It's important to note that the final point was made specifically by the organizers to assure those who have stayed up until now that their efforts have not gone to waste.  

Unfortunately, not only did the system not function as intended, it was flawed in its design even if it did. 

To understand why, imagine the following scenario:

* [A] is currently ranked 20 at 10,000 points
* [B] is currently ranked 50 at 9000 points
* [C] is currently ranked 51 at 8990 points

Before implementation of bonus damage, the score progression of these players, should they all stay awake throughout the rest of the event, would be roughly 55 per 10 minutes.  

At this point, there was no way for this score gap to be closed in a short amount of time. Therefore, those who haven't missed any 10 minute windows were at a significant advantage. 

After bonus score implementation, however, [C] will now gain &gt;55 per 10 minutes while [B] still gains 55 due to the first 2 ""rules"" of the system listed above. This causes a constant acceleration of the #50 score cutoff, as [C] now becomes the new #50, and the person below them will overtake their place with bonus score. 

As this process continues, the #50 score will approach the #20 score, as the rate of acceleration of #50 is now much higher than 55 per 10 minutes. 

At some point, the #50 score and the #20 score will no longer have a significant gap due to this difference in rate. When this happens, those who have stayed up to remain in top 20 will be subject to losing their position due to 10~100 roll variance, especially those on the lower end of the leaderboard. 

By design, this system would've negated the current top participants' advantage regardless of their intent. Understandably, the top 20 at the point of the bonus score's implementation were pretty upset.  

**However, the system didn't even function like it should have.**

The ""check"" that was supposed to prevent players from overtaking the current #20 with the aid of bonus score did not function correctly. 

Because of how close the #50 and the #20 scores became, players from rank #51 often received bonus score that was greater than the point difference of #20-50, thus putting them way above the current #20 cutoff. 

This process resulted in a rapid turnover rate of the current top 20 leaderboard as players from #50-60 jumped to #10-20 with bonus score, while the current top 20 players slowly fell in the rankings as #1-50 could not receive bonus score. 

At this point, the organizer realized their mistake and pointed out to everyone that the final scores will be recalculated and the unintended bonus scores would be subtracted from everyone's total. 

**Because of this flaw in the system, the current leader board - the only source of transparency regarding the winners of this event - became unreliable.**

____

Participants, especially those who have been here since the start of the event, now almost 40 hours ago, were upset and also confused.  

While the organizers assured everyone that the leaderboard will be recalculated to ensure that the final scores will be fair, it became a question of ""how?"". 

The event peaked at over 3000 participants, and at the time of bonus score implementation easily averaged above 500 users per 10 minute cycle. To undo only the significant ""illegal"" instances of bonus score, it would've been necessary to check over 100 players' data over 5 hours individually. Just to be somewhat sure that the current top 20 did not get there because of unintended bonus score. 

This is where clarity in how the final results were obtained, as well as who exactly the winners were, became especially important to assure the participants that the competition was still fair. 

The event required days without rest, those who dedicated less time were given an unfair advantage halfway into the event, and the scoreboard became an unreliable source of information as the actual top scorers were suddenly buried under newcomers in ranking. 

At the end of it all, the organizers never disclosed the final scores, how they were recalculated to ensure fairness, nor who the final 20 winners were. 

To the participants, especially those who have been here since the start, it's difficult to not feel like something fishy had taken place.  

Fair competitions will bring people together and foster healthy engagement in the community. Unfair competitions, even if only by perception, will instead drive people away with a bitter taste in their mouths. Which in this case, also included an unhealthy dose of sleep deprivation.  

* In the future, please be transparent with community events. From methodology of how winners are chosen, to who the winners are. Right now, your event left an impression of being shady, dysfunctional, and unfair to those who were more dedicated than others; and all we can do is hope that the next one won't be this way.",1593690738

Genshin_Impact,2020,7,"These are my first thoughts after playing all day and getting my characters to level 20.

I'm loving this game so far! The characters are cool, graphics are amazing and the story seems really good so far. The map is massive and there's a lot to explore. I really love the elemental gameplay and things you can come across in the world.

Improvements needed IMO:

Enemy difficulty (Way too easy) - Normal enemies are too weak! Like 90% of the enemies don't provide a challenge whatsover unless they're a mini boss or a boss. I feel like they're not aggressive enough and most of the time act like punching bags.

Combat: The combat is really fun but I feel like just having one circle combo is too repetitive, it would be better if we had a light and heavy attack to mix it up and chain attacks. I was thinking we'd eventually unlock another ability we could use with square but no :(

No air attacks?: Imagine jumping from a higher ledge onto the enemies below and slamming them with your sword. OR gliding above an enemy and then head shotting them with an arrow (while still gliding or falling from the sky). Surprised we can't do this already

Weapon variety: From what I've seen most characters have a sword. I feel like having other weapon types would diversify the combat even more. Examples: dual wielding, claws, fists, guns, mage staff, scythe, Axe, crossbow.

Character switching: a lot of the time while trying to switch characters mid-fight I end up accidentally going into the menu or opening the map. This is because while holding L1 I'm still trying to run around and move the camera with the right analogue stick. Is it only me having this problem? Wish we could have another way of switching or something gets changed about this. It really ruins the flow of combat. IMO L1 + the input buttons feels like an awkward way to switch chars

Support attacks: I think if a character has their special charged it would be cool to let them assist you while comboing without switching completely. E.g. press a button and that character jumps out and does their special then disappears (would help with element mixing).

Mounts: I think it would be cool if we could have some sort of animal for map traversal. Running around all the time with limited stamina is a bit tedious. (I know you stamina gets improved but still a mount would also be faster).

Overall I'm having a lot of fun with game, would recommend it to everyone and can't wait for the full release! Let me know what you guys think

Updates: 

Change attack button: Having square as the attack button feels more natural on PS4 so please change it from circle.

Menu navigation: Allowing us to navigate menus with the dpad would be soo much easier!",1593797136

Genshin_Impact,2020,7,"Now before that one person clicks and lets all the blood flow to their head without reading the post, this isn't to put down the game. People have sung praises, and still do, this isn't one of those. This is a list of things I hope will be fixed or addressed in the future. While I'm really enjoying the game, there are some things that are really killing my experience despite not being big deals, like chests (I'll go into detail about this later).

I have a habit of typing a lot without even realizing, so I'll do what I can to try to make this easier to read. Typos will be made, they're easy to not notice right away while typing a lot, so please try to overlook them. I'll probably make some edits and continue from there since I don't won't my phone to randomly refresh the page and delete all of my text.

Keep in mind that while I've played a lot of the game, I haven't progressed far into the story or anything due to exploring a lot. For the record, I'm playing on PS4.

**GENERAL/EXPLORATION/EQUIPMENT**

* Since I mentioned it and hate it the most, I'll get this done first: Chests. They give the same exact items no matter where you go, the same white artifacts with the same sets (Adventure, Curative, you know it), ore, and exp items. Very rarely does a chest ever have anything different. I do not, at all, enjoy going around, exploring almost every inch of the map, and getting the same exact stuff. It's beyond irritating when you can play for hours and hours and not make any progress as far as gear is concerned.

[Basically](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;url=https://m.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3D9OVv-J-LXQU&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiJ76H0trLqAhUHI6wKHUxiCi0Q3ywwAnoECBAQIQ&amp;usg=AOvVaw1FXgQGJJuj0QnURWaPgnFc)

* Controls. It's 2020, why can I not use custom controls or even have multiple preset options?

* Item interactions. Standing over an item (food, flowers, etc) rarely gives me a prompt to pick it up, forcing me to wal several feet away before the prompt pops ups.

* Picking up items. It's slow, simply put. One at a time and multiple repeated presses doesn't speed it up because the game slowly registers every input. A Gather All or faster response time is much needed especially when most come in bunches of three or more.

* Movement (running, climbing, swimming). It's slow without using stamina, and when you do it burns fast. Swimming and climbing makes it worse since using stamina during either of those results in your total amount of possible travel distance being reduced (you get farther moving slowly, basically). I dread climbing on this game because it's just slow, and so far, there isn't a way that's faster or more efficient. Swimming is less of an issue since you can use the MC's Geo power to travel across water at no risk.

* Experience points. The main wayto level up is to just use exp items. While these are useful for when you get new characters and want them to catch up quickly (which can easily be fixed by syncing their level), this comes at the cost of *jdrastically** reducing how much exp you get for killing enemies, even when there's a big level gap. Please, please change this. There's almost no reason to ever fight enemies when chests give the same boring items and you don't get any exp outside of the items that chests have.

* Quest tracking. This was patched in after the beta went live, but please keep this. It's not fun playing without it.

* Lack of proper item descriptions. Intertwined Fate, Acquaint Fate? These don't tell me the difference or what they're for (I know what the second is for, just an example) and their descriptipns sure aren't telling. Items need more details in general, not just these.

* Running. Please implement an option to have it be Hold/Toggle. Having to come to a full stop because I wanting to sprint a short distance is something that wears down on me after a while.

* Camera. While jumping down a short distance, the camera slams down hard, and in order to fix it, you have to use the reset button, which is disabled while tracking a quest because that becomes the priority function, to indicate the quest you're tracking, or to slowly raise the camera back up to normal. It's bothersome. To make things worse, the camera speed for Left/Right is not the same as it is for Up/Down.

* The Characters menu is basically redundant. It has no function but to show you every character you have, which the Party Setup and Character menus also do. Keep it or not, I just wanted to state this.

* Questionable boundary limits. It's really strange how certain areas of the map are blocked off while others aren't. For an example, I can't go south of Springvale to Dragonspine, but I can go far off to the west, in a whole new region (where you get Geo for the MC, sadly there's no given name for the region on the map) and freely explore a whole lot of it. It's minor, but at the same time it makes no sense.

* The spirits you follow for chests. Overall, no issue, but from time to time there's one that acts questionable. Some of these, instead of going straight to the spot that's in sight, go to a high up place and force the player to climb to reach them instead of going straight to the chest. Please change this. It's bad enough the chests have the same items as the next, even worse when you have to do unnecessary stuff to get them.

* While I know this is a bit late: Enhancing artifacts. Weapons have ore and weapons to enhance. Artifacts have... Artifacts. Just make an item that functions like ore.

* Artifacts. Now I brought up how they're almost always the same three sets, there's another issue on top of this: They just about always have the same stats, mainly low rarity stuff. ""No big deal"", no, it is because when all you're getting are low grade artifacts that have no use, it goes back to bothering to open chests being a waste of time because you'll get nothing worth your time.

* Weapons. Same as artifacts. I've only gotten ONE weapon outside of the story from a chest that was actually unique, or rather, not the same white/blue grade trash. The one inside of the three barriers.

**COMBAT**

* Random enemy spawn reset. I've had enemies randomly stop fighting right in front of me because their AI bugged out and spawn reset, gaining back all their health and wasting my time.

* The camera/lock on. It's bad. Lock on is automatic, that's fine, I guess, except you can't turn it off. Not only does this take away freedom of choice of which direction you can attack in (try to break boxes with enemies around if you wanna find out quickly), this also makes the camera automatically rotate. I find myself fighting the camera half the time.

* Element interactions. Anemo? Great. Cryo? I'll get to that. Almost everything else? Fine. Geo? Absolutely useless. It has no unique interactions and its effect is very, very weak. It is by far the worst element I've used (I don't have Hydra or Dendro, whatever Dendro is).

* Cyro. Perfectly fine in the player's hands, not so much when used by enemies. I have had multiple moments where I was frozen and by the time I mashed out (which is pretty quickly), the enemy froze me before I could even move and the loops continued till I was lucky.

* MC's Geo ability. Useful for getting across water, disruptive and awful in combat outside of deploying for cover. It's an awful attack because enemies are put on top of it, and without a ranged character, you have to climb on top of them to fight the enemies because their AI prevents them from coming down on their own. Unique but not well done

* Damage sponges. I've leveled my characters and enhanced both my artifacts and weapons and it feels like I'm never doing reasonable damage to anything around my level or higger. The worst part? I'm never getting new weapons or artifacts, so I'm stuck in terms of power. What's even better? I have to kill these damage sponges to open up chests.

* Drop down attacks. Seriously, this game could use them. The only thing I can do in the air is glide, why can I not do a drop down attack? It's not like this game has a crazy combo system or anything. Fighting a ton of damage sponges, especially without all the elements (given only five are available early on) made me realize something, the combat doesn't change much. You have your basic string, charge attack (or aim for bows), special, and your element button. So far, that's it. A drop attack wouldn't hurt.

**PERFORMANCE**

All I've got to state is that the game crashes too much. It's not even when a lot of things are going on during combat, it's just random and only during combat (thankfully). I've had 5 or more crashes already, that's already record breaking for the games I've played on PS4. I'm not joking. I know this is a beta, but please have this fixed for the full game.

Frame drops? I haven't had many.

**BUGS/BROKEN INTERACTIONS**

* I've had random dialogue for quests already completed while I'm far, far away from where it even took place.

* Opening the map. Sometimes the cursor for the map and the button prompts will show up, but the map itself won't, so I'm stuck looking at the overworld as I wait a minjte for the map to load.

* The enemy AI. As mentioned earlier, sometimes it just stops. Other times the enemy will walk backwards, and only that. No fighting, just walking backwards.

* Thorns can eat away at your health quickly due to a lack of stagger leading to the damage happening multiple times within even a single second. I landed on them on accident and within two seconds it had already done damage at least five times.

Some things have slipped my mind while typing this, but I will be sure to edit them in if I ever remember what they were.

**CHARACTER MENU**

Basically, show the crit rate and crit damage modifiers. Why would I want to invest in crit when I don't even know the base amount and can't easily reach 100? If my crit rate is gonna be 40% then I may as well boost other stats, but I can't even tell what it is at all.",1593821886

Genshin_Impact,2020,7,"First of all, all the props to Mihoyo for producing this game. Looks fantastic, the elemental interaction is a great idea and character design are lovely.

However, the performance on my PS4 Pro is so so bad. Frame rate are constantly low 20fps and below, especially in the open area. I actually can't play continuously for more than an hour because the constant frame stuttering and dramatic variation in ""smoothness"" makes me kinda ill. Switching character results in frozen screen 1/4th of the time. I can tell the PS4 is working hard because of the loud fan, and the loading screens takes upward of 3 mins when warping.

Genshin_Impact,2020,7,"I hope I'm wrong about this but:  
I'm wondering if I'll be checking this out at launch. We have all the content creators pumping out content for this like there's no tomorrow while acting like everyone has access. By the time it rolls out for everyone, their hype will be dead, and they'll have moved on to the next thing. Content publishing for this should've been restricted until the actual launch.

If I can't play at the same pace as the content creators I follow, it's unrelatable, might as well not give two ----- about the game, as you can tell my hype for it is mostly dead. What good does it do to frustrate your future customers by advertising the closed beta publicly like this? If it's happening, and I'm not part of it, that's fine, but I DON'T want to know about it.

The worst part of it is the downplaying attitude towards this from a community management point of view, ridiculing points that people might have a complaint toward has got to be the worst idea anyone could come up with, it's not funny, or smart, it makes you look like a snarky ahole, which doesn't vote well for the future.  


Makes you think that people at the handles have no idea how PR or the gatcha environment and bevaviours function. Maybe that's why nobody relevant's talking about honkai impact outsite a few hardcore channels, despite it's fantastic update.

Genshin_Impact,2020,7,"Let me start by saying that I am enjoying the game so far despite the lack of an inverted Y option. My issue is that I seem to have hit a wall and I believe it is my unfamiliarity with the gacha system that is causing it but I want to make sure.

So my characters are level 5-6 and I recently hit quests that recommend a party level of 10 and 15. So I went back to town and upgraded my weapons and equipment. I got my Adventurer rank up to 10 and finished some challenges but my character level has barely moved.

So my question is, am I forced to use the experience items to level up? Or did I miss something along the way? I did just unlock the main quest mission, so will that help?

I am aware that I have tons of these experience items, but I typically don't mind grinding so I think I mentally decided not to use them and I just noticed that I am making almost no progress.

Genshin_Impact,2020,7,"I have put two and a half full days into Genshin Impact since the start of the final closed beta. I've heard many complaints, and opinions of the game from many different people. Many love it, and many are on the fence because of some of the things in the game that have been announced, and the lack of end game content in the beta. I'm into anime, anime style games, and especially action combat games with a world to explore. Those are the big things that make me love Genshin as much as I do. But I want to go more in-depth with my experiences with the game, from the good to the bad, and spoiler free!

&amp;#x200B;

The Gameplay:

The gameplay of Genshin Impact is straight in action combat. You have complete freedom of your movement and playstyle. The four characters you are given at the start of the game can be used in their own unique way and can all be utilized in many different ways to cause mayhem by combining the elements. Climbing allows you to get to really high up places, assuming you have the stamina to make it to the top! Swimming, sprinting, really the essentials of movement is all here as well as gliding and all of it is very fluid. You're able to use the environment against your enemies. Such as burning grass to damage an enemy over time, freeze water to give you a platform to attack on, and electrify water damage over time.

&amp;#x200B;

The World/Graphics:

The world of Genshin Impact has a name and that name is Teyvat. Teyvat is full of lush greenery, and wildlife to admire while adventuring out into the unknown. In the beta you the play can go from a nice walk on the beach, the dense forests of Windwail Highland, through the breathtaking Bishui Plain, to the foggy mountains of Minlin. The beautiful world of Teyvat is brought to life via the Unity engine paired with a slick cell shaded art and lighting style. The lighting puts a very fantasy tone on the world. Its a world that will suck you in. Despite two full days from waking up at 7 AM and then going to bed as late as 2 in the morning I still have a lot to see myself.

&amp;#x200B;

Content:

The Genshin Impact Final Beta consists of a full story mode(?) As well as small quest lines that introduce the other playable characters that can be unlocked through the gacha system. Later into the first day of the beta, a free permanent event was added that gives everyone the chance to unlock Xiangling, a four star famous loli chef with a cute Kuma as her special fire attack. Not only is there a character event going on, and login event currently going on, but there are also world quests that can be triggered by talking to some NPC's, or being around specific NPC's like Dr. LIvingstone. World Quests are small, simple quests that are easy that give quick rewards. Other than world quests; dailies through the Adventurer's Guild know as ""Commissions."" The Adventurer's Guild also offers the Adventurer Rank. The rank increases from exploring, finding new materials, activating teleport points, opening chests, and doing quests, world quests, and dailies. Leveling up your Adventurer Rank gives you rewards, unlocks new experiences (dungeons), unlocks the ability to Ascend your characters, and it also ranks up your world level! The world level increases when your Adventurer Rank increases. I like to compare it to the Mayhem Leveling system from Borderlands 3 except you have to progress and grind to get the world level up. Leveling it up will make enemies more difficult and drop rates for better loot to be a little higher, making common chests and killing enemies for materials worth your while more late game. All of this plus secrets in the great world of Teyvat for you to discover! All the more reason to explore the whole map :)

&amp;#x200B;

The Battle Pass (BP):

This goes with the ""Content"" section of this review but I feel people want to know a lot more about this. So it's getting its own section because I don't want this to be the thing that people write the game off for. The BP from my understanding is unlocked through Adventurer Rank progression. Once you unlock it you're given another section in your Adventurer Handbook. It contains the rewards on the pass, and the challenges. Challenges can range from kill this to, cook this many meals, all the way to spend 3,000,000 gold, over a 30 day period of course. Completing the challenges give you BP Points. There's a free and paid tier. The free tier gives you ALMOST everything the paid one gets you but a little bit less. The BP from what I saw will cost around $10. If you decided to pay for the BP for this month then when you hit BP Level 25 you get to choose a weapon from the ""BP Bounty."" A purple rarity weapon, one of each weapon type. The premium gives you both the premium, and normal items plus two more gacha pulls, chests with goodies inside, and 680 gems. From my experience with the BP leveling it up feels like it takes forever if you're not going out of your way to level it up. There's only few BP quests that you might do by not looking at the quests. I've seen on forums people saying that this system just won't work in this game. I'm not a fan of BP systems. The only ones I like is the Honkai Impact system and the PSO2 NA system. They both gives you items if you don't pay (usually the same as the premium just a little less) and if you do pay you get a lot more. Genshin and Honkai are free to play games. Honkai is a more mobile like game compared to Genshin. Genshin feels, plays, and looks like a huge triple A game. A huge world with a lot to do and a lot of potential, and its free to play. Honkai is free to play and has been getting constant events and huge updates adding new story, maps, and even an open world game mode to explore. I never spent money on Honkai and when I wanted a character without paying all I had to do was look into it, and grind levels to get what I needed. Genshin in its current state is very similar to that. Logging in gives gems, exploring gives gems, and questing all gives gems which you can use to get more gacha pulls. Knowing Mihoyo they will add more ways to get the characters YOU want to explore the world of Teyvat as. Overall the battlepass offers players who don't want to spend money free items, gold, and gacha pulls. It offers paid player a little more of the same items, and gold as the free players and two more gacha pulls. The battlepass is of course going to change every month but I doubt Mihoyo would change too much other than what you get at level 25 and the items you can gain from it. It's balanced, it works, it adds more to do in the world. It's a good, working system.

So.. since my internet is crap I can help people who aren't sure if they will be able to play and enjoy the game. So far there has been about five times throughout my two and a half days playing this game non-stop where the game would begin to lag. To me there are two types of lag. Frostbite engine lag, and rubber band lag. Frostbite engine lag is where you play any Frostbite engine game and you'll know if you're lagging if you can't move but everyone else can. So defenseless essentially. Rubber band you're just all over the place. Now, this game when its lagging, you won't knowing you're lagging unless you try to pick up an item, fight an enemy, stamina meter goes wack, or you just disconnect. Items won't pick up immediately, sometimes enemies take a second to take damage, and sometimes the stamina meter will have a delay displaying it being drained. But despite having bad internet and everything... I've only been disconnected two times. The first time it said I disconnected, the second time I got kicked out and could log back in. But when this game lags it's not a very big deal. Plus since this is a beta the servers will be much better at full release.

&amp;#x200B;

Co-op:

Yesss. One of the most fun yet also most limiting parts of the game. Co-op allows you to explore the ENTIRE map with your friends, and raid dungeons with them. You can join your friend and then run to the other side of the map if you'd like. You can teleport where you want without permission from the host. I THINK though you have to have everyone in the game ready and present to play a dungeon though (don't quote me on that.)  The limiting part of the co-op is related to who joins who. If you join your friend you will be unable to open chests in their game, investigate things for loot, and even some NPC's just won't talk to you from my experience. You also cannot pickup any anemoculi, or geoculi, and you also can't pray at any statues. All of this info is in the co-op screen. There's pros, there's cons. There's no telling if any of these will be changed or anything. But being able to explore with friends is enough for most people, me included. Related to connectivity, I am yet to lag at all while playing with other travelers. Today I played with someone and they got booted from their own game though I'm not sure if that was a bug or their internet.

&amp;#x200B;

What I want to see in the future:

So far I love the world and what is has to offer for a beta. But of course, there's a lot I, and many other want to see in the game.

1. **The option to turn off motion blur.** I am NOT a fan of the motion blur when the game lags. When the game has some framerate issues the motion blur smears and its very unappealing to the eye.
2. **The option to turn off the HUD.** The game as is is a very immersive, and pretty game. I know it'd feel a million times more immersive with zero HUD. It'd also be great for just soaking in the scenery!
3. **A photo mode.** Adding onto the HUD thing. This game is very pretty and there have been times where I've wanted to just move the camera way out from myself and get a very cinematic shot of me standing on a mountain looking over the world of Teyvat, kind of like the trailer!
4. **Full control over the controls.** I speak for many when I say it'd be nice to be able to change all of the controls to what you want them to be. I don't know why but it took me way too long to get used to the sprint button and the menu button on PS4. Adding onto that maybe even a sensitivity slider for Horizontal and Vertical individually.

&amp;#x200B;

Bugs:

I've run into my fair share of bugs. Here's a list of the things I've run into with a small explanation on some if needed.

1. One soft lock. During the beginning of the game- when doing the dungeon that introduces Lisa and her abilities after finishing and leaving the dungeon I was stuck waiting for a cutscene that would not trigger. I stood still for a while knowing that sometimes the game takes a second to show cutscenes with no prevail.
2. Fish can swim on land when scared away by player (lol)
3. Paimon says the wrong line during a side story line (not going to specify cause spoilers)
4. Venti for some odd reason repeated what Paimon said multiple times during the story. (won't specify) I thought maybe he was mocking her as a joke but Paimon didn't respond to it at all and it came off VERY weird lol.
5. Text bug. English subs turned on yet Chinese(?) characters appeared for one of Jean's lines. (already posted a pic of it on this sub reddit)
6. The game has many performance issues on PS4. But for some odd reason I've had cases where I'm walking around in the middle of nowhere where it never lags and it just slugs a lot. (The fix right now is to log out, or restart game if it persists after that.) 
7. I've had about 5 app crashes on PS4 with error codes. (All when I was just exploring, one during a fight. I think it was cause I was switch characters while the game was lagging.)

&amp;#x200B;

So yeah. That was my many opinions and review all clumped up into this reddit post. A lot of people didn't get in which sucks so this is mostly for them who are in the dark about a lot of things that have been popping up that have them spooked. Like the BP, and the talk about the performance on PS4. This is also for Mihoyo, I hope that they read this and it helps them fix and tweak things to make the full release as good as it can be. This is also for me because I love this game and want to help more people understand the game, what it is, what it isn't, and what it could be to them if they gave it all a chance. I haven't had this much fun with a game in a while and I'm very excited to see where it goes next before releasing :) I may update this if my opinions drastically change about the game. If you sadly didn't get into the game but have a specific question comment and maybe I can help answer it :) 

Thanks for reading!!

Genshin_Impact,2020,7,My 2cents from the CBT3,1594084219
Genshin_Impact,2020,7,"***Character:*** Noelle

***Element:*** Geo

***Weapon Type:*** Claymore

***Recommended Weapon:*** 

Whiteblind (4* Crafted) or The Bell (4* Gacha)

Whiteblind gives us 24% ATK+DEF at 4 stacks which Noelle can make good use of. The Bell can refund the CD on Noelle’s E which has a really long 24s cd.

***Recommended Artifact Set:*** 

Martial Artist (4) or Resolution of Sojourner + Lucky Dog (2+2)

Martial Artist provides 12% increased damage to Normal and Charged attacks, up to 36% after using an elemental skill for 8s. Since Noelle’s charged attack only lasts 5 seconds max, we can take full advantage of this through Breastplate (E) -&gt; Hold LMB.

Alternatively, Resolution of Sojourner provides us with a flat 20% ATK buff and Lucky Dog provides 100 DEF which we can convert.

I recommend using whichever artifacts you have 4* versions of with rolls in + DEF and % Base DEF.

***Skills:***

Normal/Charged Attack: Hold LMB for Demacia. (200 stamina to get the full 5 second channel, or 160 stamina at constellation level  2)

Breastplate (E on PC): provides a shield and a % chance on hit party heal that scales off DEF. It also does a respectable amount of damage based on her DEF stat, but you have to be very close to the enemy. 

Sweeping Time (Q on PC): does a burst of Geo damage around her, greatly increases her attack range, increases her ATK based on a % of her DEF, and converts her physical damage to Geo.

Devotion (Ascension 2): When Noelle is not on the field, she can provide a shield for party members when their HP &lt; 30%. Scales off DEF at 400%. 1 minute CD.

Nice and Clean (Ascension 4): Reduces CD of Breastplate (E) by 1s on hit (aoe hits = 1). Greatly reduces the CD of E since her charged attack ticks ~2/s + final hit (11 hits / 5s)

***Opinions:***

Noelle is best used as a swap whenever Breastplate is available. It has a rather long CD at 24s. Since you will be focusing on DEF, her damage without her Q won’t be great. However when her Q is available, to maximize damage you would swap to her, stack the Whiteblind passive (+24% ATK/DEF at Refinement Rank 1), press E then Q and hold LMB. This will do significant AOE damage and should provide respectable healing to your entire party as long as her E shield lasts.

You can also swap to her just to tank hits since she will have higher DEF than your other characters. I do this for some attacks that can be hard to avoid like during wolf phase 2 or dragon phase 1. 

She is only 1 of 3 Geo options (others being the MC/Ningguang), so I believe she is DEFinitely worth getting! In terms of exploration, due to the long CD of her E, it will be difficult to do the timed Geo statues without her ult.

***TLDR:*** Focus on DEF, Swap to Noelle, E + Q + Hold LMB -&gt; swap off

Genshin_Impact,2020,7,"Hey all, I'm a CBT tester and here are my insights to what would make this game the gem it should be. I want to start off by saying that I know the test version is not indicative of the final product but after so many test it starts to become apparent what the final product will have. That's not to say CBT testers know everything the game will have at launch but we have an understanding at the very least. Sorry for the long read and thank you all for reading through and offering your opinion.

__1. A more fleshed out multiplayer/coop__ 

- Cities are actually player hubs where loads of players load in gradually. Upon exiting the city players not in your party disappear. This brings cities alive.
- Story can be played coop from start to end. This is a highly requested feature. Many don't want to put hours into the game just to play/unlock a very limited coop experience. 
- Some form of online player shop to sell and buy materials. Maybe lock some materials behind a certain AR and make the currency for trading unique and obtainable through dailies. This is to prevent players from maxing out day one.
- Make loot obtainable by everyone and to each their own unique pool of loot. If a friend and I solve a puzzle together we should both be able to get loot out of it.
- Coop missions from the adventure guild while in coop. Sort of like a bounty board with a new set of quest refreshing hourly. Quests take players through several different world bosses to complete.

__2. In Depth professions/jobs__

- Cooking, Hunting, fishing, carpentry, alchemy, smithing. More steps to __cooking__ with players able to mix ingredients. Ingredients are fixed with prefixes. Example: Ham comes with increased health regen up to x% adding butter gives instant health gain. More complicated dishes require more steps.
-  __Hunting__ brings more fuana into the game with more drops for fishing. Some fuana have a thick layer of skin that may require a claymore to take down. Some might only be taken down by magic or certain elements. Some might even require players to have a high attack rating to bring down (endgame food/hunts). 
- __Fishing__ requires Rods and bait with a new variety of fish for your cooking needs. Some bait can only be made with cooking and some bait might even be found from boss drops. Such high quality bait might reel in giant game. Fishing contest could be held in town square where players compare fish caught during a certain time frame for bi-daily/daily rewards.
- __Alchemy__ has more ingredients and more of them can be used in tangent. This allows for more ways to make that material you need to ascend your character. Alchemy can also be used to conjure pets with a fixed duration that can be set to auto loot mob drops for you. Making pets is easy but only stick around for a bit. Permanent pets can be pulled from gacha. 
- __Smithing__ has more ingredients. Like Alchemy, this introduces more ways to get the materials needed to ascend weapons. Players can now make iron works along with weapon augments. This is how players obtain prefixes to their newly found weapons. Some materials that boost elemental bonuses can only be obtained through Alchemy.
- __Carpentry__ introduces wood works. Players can now craft furniture and other types of furnishings. Rare wood can be found on Dendro fuana among other things. This encourages hunting for rare and tough game. Some furniture drops might only come from tough bosses and have a slim chance of dropping others from puzzles.

__3. Player instanced Housing__

- Players can now purchase housing at any of the major cities. Housing is instanced and players must load into houses. There are multiple housing options in each city with varying values. Players can furnish their homes with drops and crafts they've acquired throughout their adventures in Teyvat. Along with housing comes lodging bonuses which increases exp gain from mobs. Bonus exp is determined by the amount of time a player is logged off in their home. 
- Owning a property in a city gives that city's bonus. For example, owning a house in Liyue Harbor gives players a cooking bonus. Geo city offers mining bonuses, etc.
- Expeditions can now be sent from your house and the more expensive property you own the more expeditions you can send out with increased results. This encourages players to invest into housing.

__4. Character/Account Mastery__

- Players now achieve mastery/accolades/enhancements that reward x% bonus to what they are doing. These milestones level up as well. Example

- 0/250 Mitachurls defeated +10% DMG increase to Mitachurls
- 0/1000 Mitachurls defeated +10% more dmg

- 0/100 crystals mined +5% chance to get double resources

- 0/20 random events +10% increase to event rewards
ECT.

- Players can trade in mastery points for intertwined/acquaint fate. Encouraging players to work on these challenges for earned wishes. 

__5. Fast travel adjustments. Mounts introduced.__

- Fast travel now cost Mora and there are less fast travel points. 
- Mounts can be obtained from Gacha, rare boss/Domain drops, account mastery, profession mastery, or with mora at city stables.
- Assigning mounts to an expedition with a hero decreases expedition times. Some expeditions might only be available for mounted heros. 

Thank you all again for sticking through this. Its getting really late so I might go into greater detail when I get the time. I put a lot of effort into this and hope that if even one of these makes it into the game it'll be amazing. Thank you all in advance  for the feedback. Gn all.",1594293373
Genshin_Impact,2020,7,Do I have to read the manga to understand the context/background or is it pure entertainment?,1594310265
Genshin_Impact,2020,7,"I do feel that this game would benefits from having more social aspects. Some of the thing I'd like to see introduced in the game are

* Guilds and guild quarters. I do like the fact that I have my own world and I do not necessarily want the beautifully scenery of the cities to be encroached by other players but that doesn't mean I want to feel all alone all the time. I think adding guilds and having an instanced quarters could help people socialize a bit more and help each other out if they want while retaining the entire solo experience for people who prefer it this way. You could go there to chill, tell everyone about that nice pull you've had or just seek people to party with, which could be facilitated by this system.
* Global chat. This is something that's present in a lot of mobile game and isn't really used because chatting on mobile is very awkward which is why most mobile gacha communities use discord instead. On PC I believe that having a multi-channel chat would make the game feel more alive. People that want to lurk can lurk, those who want to participate will participate and those who doesn't want any social interaction could simply turn it off in their settings. Epic seven, Azur Lane, Path of Exile and a lot more game all feel like solo game but also benefits greatly from this form of interaction.

I know a lot of people are fine with how the game is but I do not like the feeling of being ""alone"" even though I want to have my own world to explore. That's why I usually do not spend much time on console game and I think the game would benefits from having those feature.

I'm not implying they should stop everything and have it be their first priority but having Mihoyo acknowledge says they want to improve upon the social aspect of the game would be a big positive in my opinion.

I don't want this game to become a MMO but I feel like it could be much more than such a closed bubble.

Edit: I don't think that the people who wish the game to be a closed bubble actually considered how nasty it would be for the game in the long term. The game is not free, it's held on the shoulder of those who pays. People who pays do it for multiple reason, including wanting an advantage in the competitive aspect (Abyss leaderboard) or to show off to other people. I don't think much people will choose to invest a lot of money in a closed bubble which will lead to the game dying at an unbelievable pace. It needs more social interaction form whether or not you agree with the ideas I bring, it absolutely cannot stay as a closed bubble for its own sake.

It's all about balance and I think my ideas does not denature how the game works, if you disagree on that we can discuss it, you can try to change my mind but let's keep it civil and not get angry over an internet post.",1594320786

Genshin_Impact,2020,7,"Since I had nothing better to do and wanted to see what others think about some characters, I decided to make this post. While I do not have every character, I do have most that are available for NA (CN apparently has more atm).

For the sake of consistency, with the exception of MC, I will only judge characters by their performance without their constellation nodes unlocked because those require dupes (MC has the items handed to you). This is only with Ascension 1 (so no A4 ability) because leveling is EXTREMELY slow because of how many bloody items you need, levels being gated by your rank that also levels slowly, and having multiple characters just makes it a nightmare because of the first reason.

There will be five tiers, A-E. If you've been to school, you know the worth of each.

I did my best with going for builds that suited them ""best"", or synced with their scaling (HP for Barbara, Def for Noelle, DPS/recharge/elemental mastery for MC and that minus recharge for dps along with crit).

Skill 1 is just that, their default. Skill 2 is their ult.

For the record, I will state if I have a weapon (blue rank, not purple) that helps them out. While this may seem like cheating to some, it's important to have a weapon available that lets you perform at your best. This only applies to same-element stuff.

A Tier:

**MC (Anemo)**: Great AoE damage, great synergy, basically the best (yet sometimes worst) element.

&gt;If you've been playing ""properly"" then you've figured switching characters is the way to play. MC (Anemo) has the best element that works in every comp and can spread elements on the field onto enemies and blow them all up with good, even great, damage.

&gt;Melee is overall weak outside of select characters (Xiangling for one), but MC's final hit brings an extra attack in that does Anemo damage, which just so happens to deal more damage and also acts the same way their skill 1 and 2 do.

+ Good recharge rate and also spawns a lot of orbs. This allows you to almost spam ults.

+ Solid normal string damage. While changing characters is ideal, sometimes you don't want to to get the most of of stuff like buffs.

+ Skill 1 and 2 are both great, even better thanks to the way Anemo reacts with other elements. Skill 1 sucks in enemies and blows them up with all elements, skill 2 sucks everything up and mixes an element, which can decimate mobs just like skill 1.

+ Short coodlown for skill 1


- Skill 1 requires you stop stop in place if you want to charge it. This can sometimes lead to a stray baby attack making you stagger and waste the skill.

- One thing that makes the element bad is that it's useless against exploiting slimes and barriers unless you have two different elements next to one another (Ice and Fire, you'll see in Abyss). This results in you dealing little to no damage.

**Razor**: Bloodtainted was used, +12% damage towards enemies with Pyro and Electro.

&gt;I just got this guy and he's just great so far. Short CDs, high energy recharge rate, great damage, great skill 2 that boosts his damage even further for normal attacks and his skill 1-and that's not all, and the second best (overall)/best (offensively) element.

&gt;His kit is stacked for a 4 star. Skill 1 has two different attacks via press and hold. Press is an attack gives him a stack (three max) that boosts his recharge rate (if you don't know, faster refill for ults). Hold is an AoE that converts his stacks into energy (again, faster skill 2). Like MC, short CDs.

&gt;His skill 2 summons a wolf that attacks when he does for both his normal attacks and skill 1 dealing seperate electro damage, disables his charge attack. It also boost his attack speed and makes him immune to electro charge. If he's switched out during this, the effect ends and he gets back 10 energy.

+ High damage, period. Rare for melee without a good attack, crit chance, crit damage build, which isn't possible at all in the beta, or at least around rank 27.

+ Skill 1 has a short CD, which makes getting stacks easier and allows him to quickly switch back and forth for element combos.

+ Skill two just makes him better, period.

+ Good AoE potential.

+ Electro is an element good for dishing out damage regardless of the opposing element.

**~~Chicken~~ Xiangling**: White Tassel was used, boists her normal attack damage by 42% (Rank 4).

&gt;I feel I don't need to do a pro/con for her, plus it'll get tiresome quickly. Basically, great melee damage (again, rare). Her skill 1 has absolutely no downtime, before it vanishes you can throw it out again, and it does good damage without being tied to her current location (throw it out in one spot to set up for later). This ofc means she's easy to combo with other characters like MC. Her skill 2 is basically a better version of what Kaeya has, bigger raidus and more damage and you can combo with it.

Simply put, she's a great dps whose only downside is being locked behind Abyss, and mode I absolutely hate starting at Floor 3.

B Tier

**Barbara**: Health build (heals scale off it) with elemental mastery due to her weapon type.

&gt;Simply put, she's there for support. Her skill 1 (long CD, active half of it, so basically just a 15 seconds CD) heals everyone when she hits an enemy, and it also heals the current character every few seconds. Also applies wet to an enemy that touches the ring around you (allows you to switch her out and take advantage of her element without using her). Her skill 2 heals everyone for a good chunk.

&gt;I didn't build her for damage nor is she meant for that. Ypu may think simply being a healer is no big deal since you can eat food, but Abyss prevents that and I dislike using items. She does a good job supporting others and doesn't have to be fully active to take advantage of her ability.

B Tier 

**MC (Geo)**: Honestly, I'd put this in B, yet also in C, but it has its ups and downs so it goes bewteen.

&gt;Good damage on skill 1 with a short CD, good AoE on skill 2. Geo spawns barriers depending on the element hit, which, to my knowledge, withstands a certain amount of damage and very likely disables all damage from the element absorbed. While that's not great for others to use offensively, like with Barbara, support is always nice. You can also use it to block off enemies and attacks.

&gt;This can also be used to travel across water and climb by spawning it and swimming/climbing to it to regain stamina.

...

&gt;Then it all goes down hill. Enemies will end up on top of it (yes, even if you quick press, which makes it appear from above unlike the hold version which makes it appear from below), and this can make killing them a nuisance.

&gt;This also stays in place till a 4th is placed, which makes it despawn, so this can get in your way and cost you in Abyss, or just annoy you.

&gt;Remember how I stated that it can make enemies appear on top of it? A random bug causes the AI to lose aggro and respawn, which ofc refills their health. Overall, it's very obstructive and its cons almost outweigh its pros

**Edit: After discussing it below with another user and rethinking it, I decided to move Lisa up (the text for her isn't changed for those that want to see it as it was). The reason being because Electro is a strong element, and unlike the other two that bring absolutely nothing (Kaeya solely brings his element, Noelle brings her barrier that overlaps with the elemental barrier Geo grants), she brings solid AoE damage and a strong element. Her skill 2 is also just too strong with all of this together to place her in a flat C.**

**Lisa**: I wanna keep this one short before my phone deletes everything I typed.

&gt;Good AoE damage, that's it. ST damage is bad aside from Ruin-type enemies (she melts them), useless against electro slimes (ofc). She's just good with AoEs and around water, that's it. Nothing special, AoE damage is already covered by others, so outside of her ideal situations (slimes and water), it's nothing worth noting.

&gt;Her skill 1 requires her to stand in place for way too long, her skill 2 is a great AoE that is my sole reason for not putting her in the next tier.

C Tier -

**Kaeya**: Skill 1 can be cancelled (about to get hit, dodge and save the CD) and has a short CD, skill 2 is a weaker yet still useful version of what Xiangling has.

&gt;His skill 2, with Hydro present, lets him easily lock enemies in place. This makes he a fantastic character to get Barbara to heal quickly. He's also great at switching in and out for combos with his skill 1, and tbh, this is how I got through Abyss quickly. His element can also lead to entire groups being frozen when blown around with MC (Anemo). However, because he's literally just a switch bot for his element and brings nothing else, he's not a B tier. Kaeya on his own is not good, Kaeya's skills paired with others are.

And that's it, he's only used for his element.

C- Tier - Nothing special, at all.

**Edit: This used to be C tier, but I kept thinking about it and she's just not good.**

**Noelle**: Built with defense because of her barrier and healing scaling.

&gt;Bulky, randomly heals on hit when her S1, barrier, is active, and her S2 enhances her attacks.

&gt;Her damage is bad if you want to make the most out of what she's designed for, ganking (just dodge like usual if you can, useless)... But the worst is that her healing is random, unlike Barbara, and her barrier overlaps with what Geo, her element does: Grant a barrier. Her S1 also has a LONG cooldown, so it's useless for Geo damage (it does damage on use).

**Edit: After being reminded about it, I decided to bring the following up.

&gt;Her skill 2 doesn't drastically boost her damage or anything, it just happens to make Crystalize more possible to take advantahe of... But her damage isn't good so it won't be either. However, this also knocks enemies all over the place, making it more difficult to pull off combos. If you can't do good damage, be good with elemental combos... She's good at neither and only makes things worse if her skill 2 is used.

&gt;: Her scaling is pure defense, so her damage is taking a hit, or her healing and barrier will. She's also not good at utilizing Crystalize, which will be weak because of her build, because her skill 1 has a long CD and her skill 2 is just... There are better options for dps, a more consistent option for barriers (MC), a better option for Crystalize (MC again), and a consistent option for healing.

Overall, pretty useless yet not inherently bad like those from here on out.

**Edit: You can try to boost her damage, but there are some issues: Her barrier becomes weaker, her heals become weaker, and with a weaker barrier it'll break easily, which means no heals. There is no reason to buikd her as a hybrid as, again, her skills will be screwed, and without her skills, why use her when every other greatsword user has higher multipliers on their normal attacks (Beidou is very likely to, idk if she does)?**

**Again, she does nothing unique, every area she has a toe in is done rather poorly period and especially  if you try to build her as a hybrid, for whatever reason. I used her a lot, gave her another shot after this list and comments below, her healing just sucks and bosses like ~~Fenrir~~  Andrius eat her barrier so fast she doesn't get a heal off with how chanced based it is and how slow her attacks are. She does C at best, I'm putting her down at C- because of the just mentioned and her lack of elemental attacks with her recharged being gutted because she does little to no elemental damage without her skill 2, which you need filled with elemental recharge... Good filler, bad otherwise. What she can do, others can do better.**

D... And here we descend

**Fischl**:

&gt;Great skill 1, the bird shoots at enemies like a sentry turret. Works like Xiangling's, except it has a longer CD and she can reposition it (not a problem for Xiangling since she has no downtime). If she shoots the bird with a charged shot, she'll do AoE damage worth 120% of the damage. Easy to combo with, ofc.

&gt;Looks good, right?

...

&gt;Alright, her skill 2 is useless. Transform into a giant dumb bird and fly towards enemies. Sound cool? It's not, that's why I called it dumb. The duration is short and you have to spin in a full circle to hit an enemy more than once, and by then it'll be done. Did I mention it controls like dogshit? She can also be hurt during this, yay, bigger hurtbox, worse controls.

&gt;But this isn't why I had the flavor text for this tier. It's because bows sucks. They have poor tracking (slimes simply moving can make normal (not aimed, normal) shots miss, and trying to manually aim them is a nightmare if you're doing it fast to make up for lost dps. Charge shots are useless aside from tagging a shield or barrier (enemies high up can be hit by tome users like Barbara and Lisa with auto detection instead of poor tracking).

&gt;They're just not good, and with that stated, you will know why a certain someone has yet to be seen yet.

E Tier

**Amber**: Same issue bow users have, but she just takes it to the next level.

&gt;Skill 1 is a decoy, we all know this. It has a long CD and attracts enemies (ofc, it's a decoy). This, however, is awful. It takes too long to explode, so using her to combo with it is an awful idea, especially when Xianing does this yet WAY BETTER with a shorter cooldown and better damage.

&gt;The worst part is that you can't manually detonate it... Without getting two duplicates of her which still wouldn't make her worth using.

&gt;Her skill 2 is a short AoE that is absolutely nothing special at all. No, really, it's not. Read the description if you want, I'm literally looking at it as I'm typing this, and I've used it plenty of times.

I would've typed this next one above between B- and C, but I quickly stopped using him since he's a clone of MC when it comes to his normals kit's really his charged attack that's an exact clone, but uis normal string is really not much different) and his skill 1 is just bad.

Bennet: Generic swordsboy. Skill 1, press for a generic fire slash, short hold for two generic slashes, long hold for three generic slashes and launch yourself (no damage taken).

&gt;As you may have noted, I'm no fan of long hold skills, MC aside because MC damages, and sucks in, enemies during it. His long hold is just bad, the knockback is annoying and only suits the background he has, but he just stands there and you have to sit there and hold it. The press and short hold and nothing special, nothing bad.

&gt;His skill 2 heals allies below 70% health, and if they're above 70% (before and during its use) based on his health, it boosts their attack based on his attack. This also granta allies the Pyro element.

&gt;His only saving grace, good support. Everything else is either generic or just bad.

Edit A few days later:

Just got Chongyun, easily A tier. Solid multipliers on his attack string. His skill 1 grants all melee allies an 8% attack speed increase while within the AoE and grants them Cryo damage, which also means consgant gauge filling because you're always dealing elemental damage. Against certain enemies, and in Abyss, this can be very good, only bad against ice elemental enemies... But why would you use it knowing the effect? His skill 2 is an AoE that launches enemies.

A character that grants a buff to others that can make them easily set off effects on their own (Xiangling and her spammable skill 1) with a 6 seconds cooldown? Literally perfect. Solid damage on his own? Even better. Perfect support with Cyro, an element that can temporarily disable enemies with Hydro? Good damage with great support and easy element combo access easily puts him at the top to me.",1594354510
Genshin_Impact,2020,7,"*(Disclaimer: I got a little carried away with the freeform response portion of the current CBT survey, so this was written for the devs, but I'm curious to see what other testers in the community think - especially other PS4 testers.  This sub seemed to like detailed feedback about turning the game into an MMO yesterday, so I hope it also likes detailed feedback about improving the game we're actually getting.  Anyway, it's long enough without an introduction, so here goes!)*

So first off - I'm sure this is being worked on already, but the main thing holding the game back for me is the performance on base PS4, and it seems to be more noticeable the more I play.  I can live with some degree of framerate drops in cities, but in combat they really detract from the fluidity of the action, and it seems to happen in almost every encounter with more than a few enemies.  Likewise, it's a bit annoying experiencing delays when trying to pick up items, and although I suspect this is because the server is pinged each time to update the player's inventory (it certainly seems worse some times than others), it still contributes to making the game not feel very ""snappy"".  My connection speeds are good and my PS4 is directly wired to my router, so the lag in server response (if that's what it is) seems unusually high, and isn't present in other games.

With that out of the way, it turns out I have a lot of more specific feedback, if you'd like to hear it.

Controls on PS4 are a major area I'd like to see improved.  Perhaps at the top of the list would be the option to rebind some of the control mappings, for players used to different layouts from other games, but there are some other small improvements I'd like to suggest:

1.  Sprinting should revert to a jog when the player stops holding R1, instead of continuing until you either stop moving or run out of stamina.

2.  The main selection wheel when holding L1 should be disabled when in combat; I have zero reason to, for example, open the Wish menu while in a heated fight.  Yet I open such menus somewhat often by accident, while holding L1 to switch characters and reflexively nudging the right thumbstick to adjust the camera, causing a selection to be made on the main wheel.  (I suppose there's an argument to be made that the inventory, at least, should always be accessible to use consumables, but frankly I think the idea of somehow *eating a meal* while being set upon by monsters feels a little bit like cheating, and the game's difficulty stemming more from time limits rather than running out of HP makes the feature seem largely unnecessary anyway.)

3.  Character selection should be changed to a static system in which each of the four face buttons is assigned to one of your four party members (for example, the player's second party member would *always* be L1 + circle), instead of the current system in which that second party member is *sometimes* L1 + circle, and *sometimes* L1 + triangle, depending on which other character is active.  With a combat system designed around switching characters to set up elemental combos, the switching itself should be as seamless as possible (i.e. you should be able to rely on muscle memory once you've assigned your characters), but the current system has me frequently switching to the wrong character since *the assignments themselves change*.  I know the system was designed this way (with square usually unassigned) to support parties of five, for those rare occasions when a guest character joins the party during a quest, but I don't like having a clumsier selection system *all* the time just to support that 1% of the game where it's necessary.  I'd much prefer that the current system supporting 5 characters was only used *when you actually have 5 characters*, allowing the more straightforward system to be used the other 99% of the time.  Or - even better - simply assign each of the four main party members to (L1 + face button), as suggested, but have the 5th guest member be something not otherwise used, like (L1 + R3).  Another possible compromise for these situations would be to simply have the player assemble a 3-character party for such missions, and add the guest character as the 4th member.

4.  This is minor, but I'd remove the ""co-op"" segment from the main L1 selection wheel, and replace it with ""party selection"".  I'd venture a guess that ""co-op"" is generally only used either once per play session (when players initially join up with a friend) or not at all.  On the other hand, I find myself using ""party selection"" quite frequently, since a single party can't possibly cover all element types, making it often necessary to swap when interacting with puzzles or obstacles in the world.  Having to go into the main menu so often for such an important feature feels a little clunky, whereas going into the menu for ""co-op"" the 0-1 times it's needed during an average session seems more reasonable.

5.  I'm not sure if this really counts as a ""controls"" issue, but it sometimes seems too easy to accidentally start climbing objects when in combat.  It's not uncommon that I'll be running to avoid an enemy attack, accidentally run into a tree or pillar of some sort (often due to bad camera placement), and watch as my character drops everything to start slowly inching their way up the surface like a caterpillar, while proceeding to eat several enemy attacks.  I think this could be avoided if an extra half-second or so of movement towards an adjacent object was necessary before the climbing animation would begin.  The slight delay would be hardly noticeable when exploring the world, but would make it much harder to accidentally start climbing in combat.

Since I mentioned the camera, I feel that it could also be improved.  This seems a little more subjective, but I don't like how the camera defaults to being at-level with the character, particularly when in combat.  I find myself frequently nudging the camera upwards, to get a better view of the action from a higher angle or to see around an obstacle.  This becomes crucial when fighting on non-level terrain, where the camera frequently collides with the ground (and subsequently becomes obscured by grass or otherwise poorly positioned).  I'd love if the combat camera was raised slightly more above ground level, perhaps 15-20 degrees upwards, to give a better view and avoid colliding with objects.  Maybe this would be better as an option in the camera settings, for people who prefer the current camera, but it's an option I'd definitely use.

Finally for controls, there should be a separate option to adjust the camera speed on the Y-axis.  In a game with so much verticality in the world design, it seems painfully slow to look up towards a clifftop from underneath while trying to gauge the height, which happens often.  I'd also REALLY love an option to disable the motion blur at higher camera speeds, unless this is a technical issue, in which case I'd still love to see it addressed.  An option to invert the Y-axis controls for the flying segments (e.g. the dragon battles) would also be much appreciated, or perhaps even in general for those who would prefer the option.

A final element I'd like to weigh in on is the battle pass.  I'm okay with its existence, and if it were better implemented I could even see it being the main way I'd support the game, but in its current state I can't see myself ever purchasing it.  I love the idea of the bigger weekly and monthly quests, to give the player some larger and more structured goals with significant rewards (much like the Adventure Log, which I also love), but the tedious daily quests kill the concept of the battle pass for me.  There's already *so* much in the game to incentivize daily logins - chiefly, the game itself, because it's incredibly fun - which is exactly why I want to log in every day I can and **play it**, not do what amounts to a laundry list of daily chores.  The daily battle pass chores - sorry, ""quests"" - should be scrapped, and battle pass XP should instead be awarded in very small amounts whenever adventure XP is, to reward players for playing the game however they choose (in addition to the large amounts when completing the more unique weekly and monthly quests).  The way adventure XP rewards player **choice** in terms of activities and freeform exploration is one of the absolute major strengths of the game - continue that design philosophy elsewhere!  If the same system were applied to battle pass progression, it'd be a no-brainer purchase for me every month.  Conversely, a set list of seemingly obligatory daily tasks would risk burning me out on the game entirely, if I felt like I couldn't ""start playing"" each session until after I finished my ""chores"", unless I was okay with not completing the battle pass I purchased.  Honestly, I'm realizing that I can't emphasize enough how much I hate the current system, especially since it can be so easily improved.

Okay - that seemed like a lot of criticism, but the only reason I bothered typing all of it is because I LOVE the game, and feel deeply invested in it in a way no other game has made me feel in quite some time.  The world you've created is nothing short of magical, and despite however many hours I've played of the beta already, I'm continually surprised; traveling to Liyue for the first time and finding not only new enemy types and a dramatically different landscape, but new *music* - including new *battle* music, even just for the most basic encounters! - was frankly a little mind-blowing.  The game already feels massive and yet incredibly, satisfyingly dense at the same time, so to think that this is only two of the *seven* regions we may eventually get is...well, that really *is* mind-blowing.  Obviously Breath of the Wild was a huge influence for your team, so I can't think of any higher praise than to say that personally, I like Genshin Impact **more** than BotW.  The fact that I can honestly say that while the game is still in *beta* is simply incredible, and I hope this game finds all the success it deserves.

If you've read this far, thank you very much for considering my feedback.

Genshin_Impact,2020,7," I collected all anemoculus, and now I just have 5 geoculus left to collect after visiting the interactable map. Now I have to backtrack, so I was just looking stuff up but then I realized that:

The genshin impact wiki tells you how many geoculuses are needed each level, and it adds up to 130.

2+4+8+12+14+16+20+24+30=130

[https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Statue\_of\_The\_Seven](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Statue_of_The_Seven) 

But the interactable map only has 129 geoculuses, and one of them is not available anymore in fcbt (The one farthest in the north) because the region is in the red zone.

This link below contains the interactable map:

 [https://thezion.github.io/genshin-impact-map/#/](https://thezion.github.io/genshin-impact-map/#/) 

So that is 128 geoculuses, and in another map that someone made, when I counted the geoculuses using 3d paint it added up to 128 too. 

These two links below contain the map:

 [https://forums.mihoyo.com/genshin/article/11485](https://forums.mihoyo.com/genshin/article/11485)

And128 is not equal to 130, so what happened to the 2?

Again I can definetely be wrong here, but can someone plz explain to me why this is so? If there is an error in the maps, then does anyone know a map that has all 130 geoculus locations? 

If there is an error in the wiki, does that mean the statue only needs 128 geoculuses?

Genshin_Impact,2020,7,"I wonder if someone manages to do a glitch, where they go into the red lined zone and Paimon drags you back telling you to explore it later, but they glitch the system so that paimon doesn’t stop dragging you. The code would think that you are yet not out of the red zone, and continuously drag you. (This May be wrong but it is a theory) That would basically being paimon hacking your controls, and continuously forcing you to walk in a straight line, eventually causing your death, as continuously walking in a straight line can either drown you, kill you by fall damage or enemies can attack you with you being vulnerable. It is likely that paimon does not control your character after your character‘s death, so if that is true then you probably wouldn’t be stuck in a loop. 

I wonder if this glitch is possible.

Genshin_Impact,2020,7,"Ok first of all I've been seeing a alot of people bashing the game because it's gacha. My question is why would you be in this forum complaining about gacha in a gacha game? Like seriously, I get alot of you hate gacha but saw the game and taught the game looks great let me give it a shot and play/watch the beta, but then you revert back into your gacha hating ways and start complaining saying they should remove gacha in the game. And please don't say it's feedback to make the game better because the game has been confirmed gacha for a while now, so your just beating a dead horse.Instead you can give feedback on how to improve the gacha, wether it be improving the rates or something else. And also people love to use the ps4 fanbase as an excuse, when loot boxes have been a thing for years. This game is being made off the gacha money from hi3, which is a meme as some hi3 players saying (I raised that boy ) and mihoyo hasn't speared a penny on the game.The point I'm trying to make is if you dislike gacha, wait until the game is released and try it then make your verdict but if you adamantly hate gacha and you know no matter how amazing the game is you'll still find the need to complain, the game isn't for you. I don't want to see this forum devolve into a drama sub with people complaining every day/week about something new, like a lot of other subs. That also goes for the people saying that others have been hyping up the game but you watched the BETA and the game looks boring.

Genshin_Impact,2020,7,"I'm in the current CBT for the PS4, played for about a week on and off and the gameplay and visuals are stunning (hats off to mihoyo for this, seriously), however, I cant help but feel limited in terms of progression. Time gates, rolls with ridiculously low odds (.6% for a 5 star, seriously?), resource throttling in late game, etc all turn me off from the game. If I dont cough up 30 bucks a month for BP and the 3000 monthly deal, I'll drastically fall behind. And even then progression will be based on RNG. 


In the end it's a mobile game with classic gacha and progression slowing features similar to many other mobile games, its just masquerading as a console game thanks to its graphics and gameplay. While this might be fine for some people (and I understand mihoyo is a mobile game developer and so nothing I mentioned is really out of the norm for them), I just have a different standard for console games.


I would pay $60 for this game. I'm not gonna pay $30 a month. Other people will, and honestly, more power to them.

Genshin_Impact,2020,7,"First i will tell you that i can´t play the game, but i watched many gameplays of it and reading, researching on it.

So on the Coop aspect of the game:

I myself love a good singlplayer game and i also like coop stuff to play with friends and others. and i can see both sides on this and don´t want a bad expierence for either one of them.

So i researched and i did read you unlock coop for Exploration and Dungeons. In the Exploration part its a bit late for it ( Advanteure Rank 16 it takes a while to get there ) but ok i guess, but the player that does join will have only the benefit that he can see you and fight with you, but doenst get rewarded in any way then. He cant open chest´s ( would be ok if the other player is to far away? ) or doeans´t get rewards from it if opened by the other player ( even if he helped to get it ). He cant pick up stuff or interact with things. i think it is so that they wont get multiple chests, items etc. but no rewards at all is kind of not okey i think, and why would you then even play coop in Exploration? I don´t know how hard it would be for the codeing etc to do this, but if they would allow all that and make it so when the joined player returns that these things are also done in his world, so he would not be rewarded double etc and don´t give extra reward for playing Coop so you don´t pressure to play it. So Coop would be fun to do together and rewarding for both, but players who don´t want to do it don´t need to fear that coop players get more rewards for playing together, or exploiting the system of it. ( maybe even if its possible rank the dmg and hp of enemys up / or place more if it is played Coop? ) i know that htis will take more time and effort to implement. but the other solution would be just take Exploration-Coop out and than one side would lose out completly..i would like to avoid that. 

The Dungeons part seems fine for me correct me if im wrong here. Both do the work both get rewards for the effort.

So what is your Opinion on this and if you like the solution and you are a CBT player may you be so kind to put it into your feedback.

Genshin_Impact,2020,7,"I'm very interested in GI's released but am never lucky with beta invites. I'm a huge fan of honkai impact and have been playing a few years without spending a dime on it, still having a blast.

I think the beauty of HI3's gacha system is that you can be free to play and enjoy 100% of the game's content without paying a dime. Being ""competitive"" and gacha is only necessary for getting good timings in their pseudo PvEvP mode where you fight PvE and compete via clear timing, but since memorial arena and abyss are basically the same content but just with scaling difficulty, I feel that HI3 essentially is super fair because you can enjoy 100% of the game as much as a person who invests $10,000 in the game (apart from being slower at unlocking limited valks, which honestly does not matter if you are not competitive). And honestly, whale probably get much less enjoyment on the competitive mode where they can spend hours resetting to get a competitive score.

Is that same idea in Genshin where from what I understand of endgame, is basically just a gacha to unlocking new heroes and weapons, but essentially, you will be able to experience all content (other than locked heroes/maxing them out) and still derive enjoy from being f2p?

Genshin_Impact,2020,7,"I've been browsing threads discussing the abysmal rates in the Genshin Impact beta and I've come across many responses defending the Gacha system which showed a really warped perspective on Gachas rates and pity timers.

&gt;Rates: 0.6% for a 5\* character *or* weapon, specifically 0.3% for a 5\* character.  
&gt;  
&gt;Pity System: Guaranteed 5\* at 90 pulls(50% chance to be a weapon). Guaranteed featured unit at 180 pulls. Tied to the current banner and reset upon pulling a 5\*.

For perspective:

* In Genshin Impact you have a **1/333(0.3%)** chance to pull a 5\* character.
* In Dragalia Lost you have a 1/25(4%) chance to pull a 5\*.
* In Arknights you have a 1/50(2%) chance of pulling the highest rarity, which is considered fairly low by industry standards.
* In Fate Grand Order, a much older Gacha known for its incredibly low and dated rates, you have a 1/100(1%) chance of pulling a 5\*.

A pity system is supposedly a **failsafe**. A system that prevents players who roll continuously from receiving nothing in return. Genshin Impact's base rates are **significantly lower** than the pity timer.

This game is clearly set up so that the majority of players will only get a 5\* character when hitting the pity timer. With the beta's rate of distributing premium currency players can expect roll once every 5-6 months, for a team of 5\* characters in just 2 years' time!

But that's just free-to-play currency right? I'm not opposed to sprinkling a little cash money on games that I enjoy. Provided you only buy the most expensive packs, that'll be **$150+ USD for a 50% coinflip** (90 pulls) to **$300+ USD** (180 pulls) on a single banner.

It doesn't end there, though. Genshin Impact has a talent system that provides substantial changes to a character's base abilities which can only be unlocked by rolling the 5 additional dupes to max out. So in the end that's a meager ***$750-1500+ USD*** for a single maxed out 5\* character.

In comparison to other pity systems Dragalia Lost increases your 5\* rates by .5 for every 10 pulls without one. Arknights allows you to buy any character with currency you gain from rolling dupes. Yet many people are using the pity system to defend Genshin.

It's absolutely insane to me that even through all of these factors this Gacha system is being given a thumbs-up, and the pity system receiving praise. Even for a Gacha game, in what world is this passable?",1594767860
Genshin_Impact,2020,7,"I do know that, as a matter of fact, getting a dupes will give you the resource you need to open a constellation on your character but is that meant to be the only way to get those? 

Is pulling for dupe expected to be the only way to get the resource to unlock the constellation? It's pretty weird that they took the time to create an entire set of resource if it is supposed to be the only way to obtain them as they could simply be automatically unlocked upon getting a dupe.

It'd be nice if you could buy the resource to unlock a character constellation from the Stardust/Starglitter exchange or simply having a new currency.

Having alternative way to farm for your constellation would make the game so much better. The constellations bonuses are no joke, they aren't small upgrade like they are in most game where you need dupes. A character with his/her constellation unlocked have so much more utility and/or power that it's like day and night.

I think a lot of people are rebuked by how you NEED dupes currently to upgrade your constellation but I'd like for dupes to become an alternated way to upgrade your constellation, not the principal one.

How would you guys like to be able to unlock your constellation without dupes?",1594768298

Genshin_Impact,2020,7,"I felt the need to clarify this as I don't think I've made it clear how the pity worked.

The 90 roll pity is the pity to have a 5\* result. Not the pity for the banner result.

The 90 roll pity for 5\* is a 50% chance to banner. Which means your 1st 5\* has a chance to fail to be the banner feature.  If you refer to the Klee banner, there are a total of 15 possible 5\* results. Of which 3 are characters (Klee, Jean, Diluc), the other 12 are 5\* weapons.

If you didn't get the right 5\* first time. The second 5\* is guaranteed to be the feature (i.e. Klee). Which means the spending cap for a banner is 180 rolls or 28800 gems.",1594780002
Genshin_Impact,2020,7,"I saw [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Genshin_Impact/comments/hrc4oy/warped_perspectives_on_gacha_rates_and_pity/) on the pity system and [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Genshin_Impact/comments/hr2mu1/genshin_rates_vs_peers/) where people compare it to other games. So I figured I could run some simulations on the games I played (AK and FGO). Pity or not, what matters is the actual rate, and in the big picture the pity system is only a way increase the rate insignificantly in a way that make the players feel like it's significant.

[Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/Qcm9jku.png)

Here's the [repo](https://github.com/mx73/gacha-simulation). Tell me if I did something wrong.

In Arknights the rate rises from 2% to 2.55%(100 pulls) - 2.85%(1000 pulls), and you can see the rate jump in the range of the 50 to 100 pulls thanks to the pity system of 2% increase for every fail after a 50 failstreak, even though not by much. in Genshin it spikes at the 90/180 mark, from 0.6% to ~1.6% for any 5*, and 0.3% - 0.8% for 5* character, and just get worse until you hit a multiplier of the mark again. So yeah, if you consider only the character, it's just objectively worse than FGO, since it never passes the 1% mark.

The strategy is quite clear though: just hit the mark and give up. It's not worth it.

Also if you have clear information of the pity system of other games please comment. I tried looking up Dragalia Lost and it's somehow confusing so I just give up lol (is it 4% or 6% or 0.5% and how does it rises??? etc.)",1594786277
Genshin_Impact,2020,7,"Lately I have seen a lot of people discussing how unfair the rates of the gacha system are. I'm still unsure how to feel about it yet. Other gacha games require specific units from the gacha to be able to clear content, this game does not look like this. 

That makes a huge difference in the structure and monetization of the game. If I can progress throughout the game with the main character and the other non gacha units, the gacha system becomes a luxury that increase the replayability of the game. In this scenario I would be ok with the current rates. After all, the game is free. 

I do understand the concern with the gacha system, as I have been a victim of it. Any person can become a whale in one day (we all have does days self-control fails). Sadly that has nothing to do with the rates but the system itself.

Genshin_Impact,2020,7,"All the recent talk about the gacha is great, and definitely needs to happen before launch, but there's a bigger issue with it that simply bumping up the rates won't fix: it's all-or-nothing.  You either get a character, or you get a rock *(essentially)*.  Because let's be real, no one is doing gacha pulls for the weapons.  They're only there as consolation prizes, but they're not very good ones, because they don't console you in any way; they feel awful.  And yet ironically, in an action RPG where getting loot *in the game* should be exciting, getting weapons from the world chests usually isn't - because you're already swimming in them from the gacha.  Let's fix both of those problems at once.

The solution seems pretty simple to me.  Keep the full, ready-to-play characters themselves as rare pulls, like they are now, but replace the weapon pulls with **character shards**, which are essentially partial progress towards obtaining a character.  So maybe it takes 50 shards in total to obtain a character, and instead of a blue weapon, our ""dud"" pull is now somewhere between 5-15 shards (randomly determined) towards a single character - not actually a dud at all, but actual, tangible progress towards a character.  Introduce a new, less common tier of pull - maybe at a 10-15% chance - that's a somewhat more generous amount of shards, say 20-25, for something a little more exciting that doesn't only happen when the planets align.  And our new rarest pull, at a 1% chance (let's get rid of that 0.3% nonsense), is essentially 50 shards: a complete character.

While we're at it, get rid of the 4-star and 5-star distinction between characters, because it's irrelevant aside from rarity.  In a genre where we're conditioned to think that ""4-stars"" are usually weaker characters with lower stats (that can often be promoted into ""5-star"" versions of themselves), using this terminology is downright confusing.  It doesn't even make sense *within* the game, since we already have a completely separate ""star"" system - the ascension level - in which all characters start at *zero* stars, regardless of whether they're freebies, 4-star pulls, or 5-star pulls.  It's overlapping terminology and visual indication (""stars"" in each case) that only serves to needlessly confuse new players.

If we still need rarer characters, to give something exciting to chase - and we probably do, much like how the concept of ""chase rares"" in a TCG keeps people opening packs - just take a page out of that same TCG playbook, and divide the characters into common / uncommon / rare.  Common characters should be the ones that aren't necessarily flashy, but have so much utility or fill a gap so well that they should be on most rosters by the endgame.  These would be characters like the ones the game kind of ""gives you"" already, like Noelle for an early claymore user, or Xiangling for your first reliable AOE fire user.  At uncommon rarity we'd have characters that are maybe a little harder to use or more niche in some way, and our rares would be characters that aren't strictly *better* than the others, but either have very unique playstyles that set them apart, or are otherwise very flashy or exciting in some way.  The best part is, we can use the ""rarity colors"" that are already in the game, for an easy visual indicator: common=grey, uncommon=blue, rare=gold.  Or blue-purple-gold.  Either way, you'll get shards more commonly for the more common characters.  Simple and effective.

But the thing that would *really* tie the whole system together - and give players some much-needed choice, while still keeping the exciting randomness of the gacha - would be the ability to **exchange** shards.  Simply introduce an NPC in every major city who can perform the exchange.  In it, you could exchange shards of characters you don't want at an unfavorable rate - say, 4:1 - for those you do, provided they're at the same rarity.  So maybe I really want Xiangling, and I'm sitting at 45 shards, but I have zero taste in waifus and have a bunch of unwanted Noelle shards lying around.  I could exchange 20 Noelle shards for the 5 Xiangling shards I need to unlock her.  I realize the stardust (or whatever it's called) resource from the current gacha *kind of* fills this role, by letting you save up and buy characters or items from the associated store, but the shard exchange system would be a lot more flexible while still keeping the excitement of pulling one character's shards over another.

And that's it.  I don't think Genshin would be the first gacha game to have such a system, but in a game where we're really only playing the gacha for the characters - and every other pull feels bad - it would be **so** much more satisfying to at least make *some* progress towards a character with every pull.  Blue weapons are zero progress towards basically anything, except when it comes to making the in-game loot feel exciting, and they're like *negative* progress in that regard.  They need to get out of the gacha, and I'd love to see this instead.",1594797797
Genshin_Impact,2020,7,"Since Gacha seems to be ""the"" topic right now.

Gacha in Genshin Impact is optional.  
It's pull to make it easier, not pull to progress.  
You can clear all content without relying on pulls at all and the MC is one of the strongest characters currently. (based on what we know from cbt3)

This is why the Gacha rates are different to ""pull to progress"" games.  
Plz compare the Gacha to games without PvP that are also not ""pull to progress"".  


Everybody in cbt3 is f2p right now.  
Do they look like they are struggling because they lack certain characters?  
Are they unable to clear content?  
Do they look like they have no fun?",1594816549

Genshin_Impact,2020,7,"I Google Translated a Chinese Wiki Page, and there were some interesting results",1594831096
Genshin_Impact,2020,7,"Edit: Chi of Guyun. I love typos 

If you're curious, it's a questline you start after solving one of three stone statue puzzles. One is directly W of Qingce Village behind a teleport point. Another is SE of the village, W of the teleport point on top of the mountain. A third is direcy S of the letter A in Village, you'll find a Ruin Hunter there, and if it's not there, you'll see orange rocks around the area and a slab in the middle of the ground to interact with. The first two can be done for sure early, not sure if the third only triggers after starting the quest, I doubt it.

For the second puzzle, you may be curious what the Adepti's Abode refers to depending on the quests you may not have done, it's referring to Jueyun Karst. The rest you should know unless you skipped the Archon line for Monstadt.

Anyway, prepare yourself to be blue balled. The end of the quest takes you to an area that's visibly, on the map, out of bounds. I went to the room with treasure, and what do you know, the game teleported me all the way to Springvale. I thought it was because I had Direct Join on for co-op, which loads the map all over again, and aso i went back. Again, teleported all the way back to Monstadr.

So just letting it be known, you're in for disappointment",1594841816

Genshin_Impact,2020,7,"Okay boi-oh.

Boy-o?

Boyo. Not Goya, those beans support trump so we don’t talk about them.

So everyone is talking about Gacha in this Gacha game where you play as a lost space kid on a wacky adventure (SPOILERS!) and holy shit I’m hype for it. Not the Gacha, being space kid.

And now I want to spend my two cents to get more people angery on the internet and hopefully get some more ideas flowing through this reddit dumpster fire.

Also? Get better at creative writing, though nothing fictional will be discussed.

Except for space kid.

So, the Gacha rates are doo-doo, and everyone here hates it whether they think they do or don’t: you’re either making excuses because you want to love the rest of the game, (Hi! I like this boat with you guys in it fellow consumers!), or you’re open with your disgust with the predatory practices of Gacha gaming because this game can be so much more than what it will be if they don’t fix their thrice-damned 5 star rates, please! (Okay wait, that boat looks pretty nice too… maybe I’ll swim?)

I agree with both boat parties, if I lost you there… and if you don’t think the gacha rates are bad, then well… I have news for you… they are. Sorry there, fellow gamer, the game still looks good, but the rates are terrible. You should now proceed over to boat one or two, because if you can’t stop lying to yourself about this I think… you probably already hate me. Please don’t! I want what’s best for you!!! And me! And Mihoyo… I guess? (In that order too, probably.)

So let’s look at a bit MORE information that some of these other posts have been ignoring:

The monthly cards and the BATTLE PASS (TM) (editor note, do they have a name for this yet? I like Bankai Pass because if Bleach did anything right it was cool sword and sword accessories.)

Some people are complaining about the amount of Funbux (In this case, Primogems) you get per Dollarino (In this case United States Dollars (USD)) you spend, and that is a good concern to have… but not part of the problem. You should not be buying these at full price unless you are a WHALE. (Big letters because big players, am-i-rite?) Nothing wrong with whaling, but anyone else who wants to spend ANYTHING on this game should be buying Bundles, Battle Passes, Bags, or… Monthly Cards. (Anyone got a B word for months?)

Now we get to speculation territory.

It sounds like for 5 USD, we can get 3000 gems/month. Nice! That’s 18.75 pulls!

And the battle pass will be giving pull currency (Wish bricks?) that equate to… Someone from Beta Save me, how many Wish Bricks do we get? And what “KIND”?

Yes, Travelers, “Kind” of Wish Bricks. See, there are two “Kinds” of Wish Bricks: Normal and Abnormal… and these wish bricks… hold on…

I’m getting word that the pull currency is not: “Wish Bricks, defenestrated through the windows of fate. The two varieties being Red and Other...” They are “Acquaint Fate” and “Intertwined Fate”… and are tiny little rounded triangles. Wow, that’s lame. Okay, let’s talk differences.

Acquaint Fate are used for the “Standard Pull”, which correct me if I’m wrong is the basic bitch pull that all the characters end up in eventually, a true Gacha hell in which no goodness escapes from. The last resort for when your waifu/husbando dodges wallet-chan and falls into the abyss, where only body pillows and fanart lie.

Intertwined Fate is the good one.

Okay more detail… Used for Limited Wishes, the ones where People and Objects are FEATURED and have increased rates, a hail mary pity counter that counts up to… one hundred and eighty? 180? What the actual…? Okay yeah, whatever. We’ll get back to that. Yeah it’s the better currency.

And they… cost the same? Okay… wait.

No. Acquaint Failure should cost less than Intertwined Figment (Because your rates are so bad your characters are figments of your imagination!!!) Cut that cost. 120/pull or 80/pull, c’mon people. That banner is probably a Noob trap and you know it! Give that currency out like the good houses on halloween give out candy: in Excess. (Real question, does everyone here know what Halloween is? It’s a holiday where you send children out alone after dark to get kidnapped and eat razor blades hidden in candy apples. Wait no, that’s wrong on at least 4 levels, and if it were true it negates the point I was trying to make… CAN YOU SPOT THE WRONG?)

Actually, I’m going to bet that Acquaint Failure ARE going to be the primary reward on the Battle Passes,  Adventurer rewards, and OTHER, which they should be dropped often and freely. Give us more, daddy Miyoho.

Cool, peeps like gacha, and now we have a lot of gacha. Rates are still bad, but hey, you get some shots at something! Everyone loves the Gacha Rolls!

Okay, next up, don’t lower the cost of Intertwined Fate, don’t give us many of those. (Or any!)

I can feel your eyes narrowing, your faces getting all scrunchy, at least one person has now started screaming: “WAIT BUT NIT WIT HOWIE SAID THAT ROLL IS GOOD ROLL AND I WANT THE GOOD ROLL FREE-EEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!” And maybe other people are like, “Where’re you going with this? That’s the roll we want.”

Because that’s what you should grind for.

Give us more currency for playing the game.

\*Mic Drop\*

“Give us currency for opening All chests, Even respawnable ones.” I say with my head pressed to the floor, the microphone dropped much too early for my actual point to be made. But it is here now, and so am I.

1-2 a pop. Maybe make it a chance spawn?

Let players get a guaranteed 3 or something when they spend 40 energy to open a boss chest. Just get players more currency, and not on daily limits.

True F2P players will grind for the currency, People without all the time in the world -read: the employed- will spend cash money on the monthly stuff, and whales will still do what they do.

But rates?

Whatever, you can have doo-doo rates and stuff, but currency will be farmable, the player retention will be INSANE, this could be INDUSTRY DEFINING, your parents will be PROUD, all because Mihoyo went off the rails.

Upsides:

Good game, lots of players, bad rates to keep whales whaling, good drops to keep players playing.

When you make a game, the number of players playing matters, a lot. People have discussed PvEvP ranking systems and stuff that’s right around the corner in this game. You need players to be on those leader boards so the Whales feel better about stomping the poor, and the skilled feel better about teaching whales what’s up, and everyone feels cool about getting swag. Community brings in community.

So lets talk why I think this idea sucks:

Poopy rates are still poopy.

Grinding sucks.

This isn’t an MMO, so player retention matters less. (That’s wrong. You’re wrong. You say that ain’t how it be, but it do.)

Discuss.

“We need a TL; Doctor.”

“Thank you, Nurse.” The doctor rises, mic once more in hand. “Give us more Primogems, don’t limit them to daily energy refills or other such non-sense; and also don’t raise rates. Please, Let us grind for what we need to be the berry blast, I mean very best.

“Also…?” The Dr. Pauses, his most radical thought yet on the tip of his tongue. “Rename Battle Pass to Bankai Pass after the Strickland Propane of Anime, Bleach.

“Thank you Himoyo; I wish this game the best.”

Genshin_Impact,2020,7,"Assassin's Creed: Odyssey is an open-world game with a lot of verticality in its world design.  Its designers correctly determined that this world design provides many opportunities to yeet dudes off cliffs, and that yeeting dudes off cliffs is hella fun.  They even designed a skill, Spartan Kick, whose main purpose is to yeet dudes off cliffs.  You kick them, and they are thus yeeted offwards, never to trouble you again.  It's very satisfying, and very fun.

Genshin Impact is an open-world game with a lot of verticality in its world design.  There are many elemental skills that can interact with the environment, which is awesome, and these skills include wind blasts that are more than capable of yeeting dudes off cliffs.  But in Genshin Impact, when you yeet a dude, said dude quite often survives the fall.  Dude then proceeds to ineffectually bum-rush the cliff face you're perched atop of, making it so that you can't even hit them with your ranged characters.  You have to go all the way down there to finish them off, then slowly climb all the way back up to get your encounter chest or ley line reward or whatever.  It's kind of the opposite of satisfying or fun.

All I'm saying is that in a game where I *could* be yeeting dudes off cliffs, I often find that instead, I position my character **in between** dudes and cliff edges - on purpose! - so that they *won't* fall off.  That's insane, and could be so much more fun.

Please miHoYo, make enemies take more fall damage, and together we can make yeeting great again.  Thank you.",1594880533

Note: This is my opinion so I don't expect all of you to agree.

Like

\-Story

\-Very calming music (that I can listen to them forever). I also like the battle music especially thefight with Stormterror dvalin.

\-Element Gameplay / Combat system.

\-Environment

\-Character Design

Cons:

\-Some stages are 1 stage format like if u finish this lvl/stage, ur done on that lvl and u can't repeat it.

\-I feel that its too slow to progress like in story. Example: I need to be lvl 34 to continue that story

but all i do are do 4 daily quest only, find chest/shrine, get materials in order to progress but i get tired cause its repeated and progress too slow cause of low exp/energy system.

\-I explored all the world already but there are locked dungeons and secret bosses that I can't enter/fight cause I need like to finish the story before I unlock that dungeon/boss.

(like the ice wolf boss, i got surprise that there's a boss like that and it was unlock after that wolf story)

\-Energy system clashes with the content like it kills that co-op system.

\-Gacha rates so low plus it's hard to get wish currency to pull plus i need dupe weapons to refine them or dupe characters to upgrade them.

Suggestions

\-Improve / Remove the energy system (I prefer removing it)

\-Improve the adventure lvling system.

\-Improve the gacha rate ""or"" the collecting of wish currency

\-Change archer combat system like all i do is Charge then attack. If that is the default combat for archer then I wish their normal attack is auto aim like the mages where if its in air it will atk on air if its on right side, it will on right side.

\- Chat system. I don't know if there is a chat system but I don't see it cause i find it weird there's no chat system when the game can be multiplayer also.",1595041783

Genshin_Impact,2020,7,"From the complaints that I have seen, people are angry at how characters can have their kits gated by dupes, which in turn are costly to pull or pity. I understand that the gatcha characters are not required for the main game, but I also understand the people who argue that they would be bored using the same few characters.


Would a farmable yet time gated universal dupe material help with these problems? This means that for a F2P they can be assured a character’s full kit after they pull or pity the base version, though only after saving or grinding for a long time. This would drastically lower how much they would need to hoard for a specific character they like.


These can be once a month type of deals, with events giving out extra copies if needed. 4* dupe materials should be much easier to farm, being once a fortnight for example. This would allow a full potential 4* roster to form for F2P and address some fears over hard content being gated by maxed characters.


For the company, I feel that the current expected spending for a maxed out character are too high even for some whales. It costs roughly 1000$+ to pity a character enough times to dupe it out it seems. This basically murders the dolphin community. With a farmable dupe system though, the cost of entry would be greatly reduced. (base character pity at 100$-200$ depending on luck at 90 pull pity). Money can still be made out of offering dupe material packs and general currency sales. Even a monthly deal for some currency and a dupe material at would allow a dolphin community to form around it.


And anyways, characters and thus different kits shouldn’t be locked away so hard. Surely there must be better ways to monetise the game? Like costumes. Make full use of those amazing graphics, right?


——————————

EDIT: Forgot to put a TLDR, ‘tis a lengthy post.


Monthly farmable universal dupes means gatcha is less bad and makes low rates more bearable. Dolphin community isn’t shafted this way. Costumes maybe?",1595339517

\*\*---Genshin Impact releasing on iOS/Android/PC before October---\*\*

That's right! Genshin Impact will officially open its doors on iOS/Android/PC platforms before October! Travelers will then be able to freely visit the continent of Teyvat to start an adventure of their own. Remember to stay tuned to announcements from our official channels for the exact release date!

In order to provide all Travelers with a smoother, higher-quality Genshin Impact experience on PlayStation:registered:4, we will once again hold a closed beta test for the platform on July 30. Due to limitations on the test platform and server regions, we will only be able to invite a portion of eligible Final Closed Beta applicants on PlayStation:registered:4 from the North and South American regions. We apologize to any Travelers not invited and ask for your understanding in this matter. We will finish sending out invitation letters for this closed beta by July 29, 18:00 (UTC+8).

This looks to me like the TikTok of gaming; sure it's an extremely slick product but I don't know if I can trust it.

My wife reckons I'm in deep tinfoil hat territory but I don't see how a BOTW-style game with enormous production values can pay for itself on self-limiting gacha microtransactions alone. Maybe I'm naively underestimating the buying power of gacha otaku but I can't help but feel the real value to the developer is in monetizing the data, not the microtransactions.

Genshin_Impact,2021,1,"Good Day and Happy New Year!! This will just be a quick Fischl build guide that I don't see too often. The idea for this build is that it takes advantage of the free to play weapon Compound Bow, in order to deal mixed damage between Physical and Electro at around 50% each. This build is a versatile one since it can deal decent amounts of both physical and electro damage, but not very high numbers for a specific one. Keep in mind that this build is based on a C6 Fischl, which gets a lot of damage from electro. Being a hybrid DPS means that you can deal physical damage while on the field, and also out of the field through Oz's electro attacks and C6 passive. 

Artifacts: 
2-set Gladiator
2-set Thundering Fury

To achieve this, 15% electro damage comes from the TF set, with an additional 46.6% from the goblet, yielding a 61.6% total electro dmg bonus.

For the physical damage part, a lvl 80 Compound bow would give 62.9% total physical damage. 

With these values, the ratio of electro: physical damage would be roughly around 50%. In the showcase video, Oz crits were seen to be higher than the physical dmg crits, but generally, the damage is pretty balanced. There are advantages and disadvantages of course. Advantages include versatility in playstyle, allowing you to choose not to use Oz for the C1 passive and deal more physical dmg or utilizing Oz since you have the electro dmg bonus anyways (except when fighting electro slimes ofc)

In conclusion, this build is meant for C6 Fischl DPS, since at C6, more value comes from electro damage than physical damage. While you can still just build pure physical damage for a C6 Fischl DPS, it would require you to not use Oz in order to get the most damage from the C1 passive. In the end, it all depends on the playstyle you want to go for though :) 

Any comments and suggestions are greatly appreciated :) Thanks for reading this post and I hope you all have a great year ahead!!

\[Here's the link to the spreadsheet if you're interested.\]([https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JgbRFbp0\_Q\_i3QeuqqqK7dOgRu3KpSbOgTHpaZXydc0/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JgbRFbp0_Q_i3QeuqqqK7dOgRu3KpSbOgTHpaZXydc0/edit?usp=sharing))

My primary goal was to complete the achievement for 50 Unusual Hilichurl Kills which I got part way through this month but I decided to continue hunting to finish the month off.

My data shows that there seem to be only 14 spawn locations total. I've read in a couple places that there are 16 but I wasn't able to find Wei at either the Jueyun Karst or Qingxu Pool spawn points.

I'll include a color coded kill count per location chart here.

https://preview.redd.it/vjahn0h7cm861.png?width=157&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=541013ec09fa3df69ca9e27afcdf70e552424deb

75 kills results in 1,350 AEXP or 270 Resin worth of AEXP. Across 42 days of murder it saves you roughly 6 Resin a day :P Not especially impressive, but a decent side effect of getting the achievement which comes with 55 Primos.

This is the last update I'll be doing since there isn't enough incentive to hunt this guy down each day passed 50 total kills. Perhaps if he dropped anything other than cabbage such as elemental gems then I would continue hunting him.

EDIT: I realize now I added up the total days wrong. It's 52 total days, not 42. So my 6 Resin a day value was off, it's actually closer to 5 a day.",1609462635

So I was respawned at the teleportation point near it. I go there again to try again but the Resigvine didn't spawn. Like I cant kill it since its not there? All I can see is that dead root from the beginning and my quest telling me ""defeat the cryo resgvine"" but how the heck can I when its not there?? Is this a bug? Should I just reload my game or something? This sucks since I cant even do it in co - op since I have to kill it first. Someone please help me out !",1609462798
Genshin_Impact,2021,1,"Since all the domains will probably be on liyue and mondstadt, would be cool if they add the dendro characters and the dendro domain in the chasm region, just like the hydro/cryo set was on dragonspine.

Also, to be together with the dendro artifacts, I have a suggestion about an artifact set that could go on that domain.

2 pc: +25% energy recharge.

4pc: 

1s version: Gain an additional 40% normal and charged attack damage while affected by an element.

2nd version: Being affected by an element increases all party members ATK by 30% for 12s.

So I decided to go get some weekly BP challenges done.

About 10 minutes later someone with a character name like BotNingBuilds comes in and immediately starts bragging about his ""best"" Ning build.

I'm over here watching him get his ass clapped at WL7 and his awesome 59 damage per attack.

He kept asking me to ask him about his ""awesome"" build.

He tried directing me to a website. This is a classic phishing tactic.

For you younger players out there, NEVER go to websites that someone might suggest unless you know it's legit.

The scam would probably be:

1. Enter co-op.

2. Look up host user ID.

3. Plug your website which requires registration.

4. Cross reference the registration with Mihoyo account.

5. Steal account.

Genshin_Impact,2021,1,"So just to get this out of the way, first, I don't really ever have worse than a ping of 78-83. So not great, but normal. 

With that out of the way, the problems with this event are myriad, and inexplicably bad. Things I've seen while running the event with about 25 attempts (11 successful):

- Regisvine never opening after all crystals are shattered (happened twice)

- Regisvine freezing after core is broken, only to suddenly show its downed stated 3 or 4 seconds later (multiple instances)

- Regisvine moving instantly from its smash attack into the vortex attack (too many to count)

- Shield crystal never showing, leading party to not know where to run and a party wipe

- Scarlet crystals not showing until several seconds after a kill of slimes, etc.

Things that are just plain dumb about the event (mainly because of the above issues):

- The vortex doing far too much damage

- The initial floor ice put down by the first slimes and whopperflower doing too much damage

- not giving players a few seconds of invulnerability when joining the fight, meaning lots of insta-deaths when paired with the above issues

Again, those things wouldn't be bad, really, if the other issues listed weren't a problem, but pairing unforgiving damage with the crippling netcode issues has made this terrible.

I'll get in my 16 in somehow and try to clear the store, after which I'll never touch this challenge again as it is utterly anti-fun right now. The co-op with the meteors wasn't bad for me, but the first co-op challenge was not good, either, and it's plain you all have to improve this.",1609465587

At AR 50, you unlock the current lvl cap which is 90. If it stays this way eventually you will get your mains capped, beat spiral abyss 9-12, get good artifacts etc. &amp; the game won’t be as “challenging”.

While I’m not sure when, I’m assuming the cap will increase, or some other way to ascend your characters will be unlocked. If that does happen do you guys also think there will be more Spiral Abyss floors added? Otherwise we’ll end up using 100+ lvl characters, making Abyss much easier(not complaining tho).

Are there any other end game speculations you guys have?

* got c4 fischl (need 1 more of her + glitter shop for c6)
* got c2 sucrose (dont need more since c4 is only for AA)

i personally dont need albedo on my team rn and kinda want Xiao to pair with my Jean(and it's kirito JP VA). but c1 bennett and c6 fischl ***tempts*** me. especially c1 bennet because i kinda like to raise him as a carry.

if i win this gamble, ill get a guaranteed chance on xiao, but if i missed the non-featured 50-50, i doubt that i can scrape 24k primos in ~55 days without top-ups. but its not the end of the world for me since i still have 50-50 chance on xiao and i do like hutao and ayaka.

12k/75 pulls is doable

55 days = 11d albedo + 21d ganyu + 21d xiao +2d spacing

* daily+welkin = 8800 (55*160)
* 4x abyss spire = 1600 (2stars)
* maintenance + seize the day on 1.3 = 600
* February stardust = 800 (5 intertwined)
* Banner trials = 40(ganyu xiao)

= 11840 primos. so i need 160 primos to get 1 soft pity and another 12k for guaranteed in-case i get albedo. i doubt lantern fes(1.3) offers that much in terms of primos

Genshin_Impact,2021,1,"I'm rather frustrated with this one.

So this boss fight seems to be brutally painful with a level of jank that makes mid-2000s flash games look like they're masterpieces of video game design.

I have been playing around with several party compositions and they seem to struggle no matter what I try against this boss. I am just trying to get some ascension materials to have better healers and DPS so that I may hopefully be able to face this boss easier in the future.

But let's see what's so painful.

- Surface of the arena falls away, making the final area rather small
- Shockingly high damage output
- Deceptive animations that mean you can get killed at supposedly safe distances
- Very little feedback
- Final phase contains a boar that seemingly heals without the boss demonstrating why it has healed
- Final phase has an instant-kill mechanic for no discernable reason.

I am tempted to drop this game if this is the quality of the boss fights. It's just so bad. Nothing about this boss feels fun, yet it is necessary for levelling up characters.

This boss may be able to be done if you're whaling or have a solid amount of time in the game, but how is this expected to be done by players who didn't happen to run into the right characters on banners?",1609469131

Genshin_Impact,2021,1,"While I’ve been looking into this recently, [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Genshin_Impact/comments/kmtd0m/how_to_pronounce_liyue_character_names_in/) about Cantonese readings of Liyue character names inspired me to post about it on Reddit. I also always like to take an opportunity to remind the English speaking world that Vietnam has a significant history prior to the Vietnam War and French colonial period, and Genshin and its Liyue region just so happens to be a weird intersection of interests :)


**Feel free to skip to the actual readings at the bottom, after the last horizontal rule**: this wall of text is more of some contextual background info that you may find interesting. I highly encourage that you check out the Cantonese reading post above as well: you’ll see some parallels in pronunciation (which are explained a bit in the background and reading info sections).


TL;DR of the background info: due to a long history with China, Vietnamese has a built-in system for reading Chinese characters like Korean and Japanese.

---
__Part 1: Background info for nerds__


For my background, I’m US-born ethnic Vietnamese with an immigrant family. I don’t consider myself to be particularly skilled with Vietnamese: while I have the intuitive feel for the language my vocabulary is rather lacking. Nevertheless, I’ve developed an interest in the history of the language and how it relates to other East Asian languages like Chinese, Korean, and Japanese. Please chime in and correct me if you find something wrong!


Before we get to the topic at hand, let’s get into a bit of history and amateur linguistics! (caveat: linguistics is not my actual field of study).


While not descended from Chinese languages like Mandarin and Cantonese, Vietnamese has had a very long history of contact and exchange with Chinese. This resulted in a lot of Chinese “words” being loaned into the Vietnamese lexicon (“words” in quotes because we can debate about what exactly a “word” is in these languages; it’s not as clear cut as in something like English). This manifests itself as something known as “Sino-Vietnamese” and in two layers. Reviewing Vietnamese history a bit, Vietnam has had multiple stretches of time where it was an independent kingdom (as independent as a tributary state could be) or was outright controlled by imperial China. The first layer of borrowing came about during the first and second Chinese dominations around ~1800-2000 years ago. This “old Sino-Vietnamese”/”non-Sino-Vietnamese” layer, reflecting Old Chinese, is well integrated into the language and its words are considered as “native” words. The second layer comes from around 1000 years ago from both another domination by China and independent efforts to import Chinese words and reflects Middle Chinese. Being larger than the first layer, this second layer is fairly substantive and introduces a bevy of scholarly and academic words. What this results in is native Vietnamese words (including non-Sino-Vietnamese) generally forming the typical everyday vocabulary and Sino-Vietnamese generally forming a more scholarly/academic vocabulary (some Sino-Vietnamese has everyday usage, however). You can actually liken this a bit to English and its relation to Latin, where English is a Germanic language with Latin-derived words forming its more academic vocabulary. [Wikipedia’s entry on Sino-Vietnamese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sino-Vietnamese_vocabulary)


As a side note, Korean and Japanese also loaned words from Middle Chinese, and together with Vietnamese, have been used in reconstruction efforts of Middle Chinese pronunciation. [Wikipedia’s got a neat entry about it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sino-Xenic_pronunciations)


Let’s not forget about writing! Today you see Vietnamese being exclusively written in *(chữ) quốc ngữ* (“national language (script)”) which is a romanization coming from early efforts in the 17th century by Portuguese missionaries and later the French in the 19th-20th centuries. Prior to this, however, Vietnamese used Chinese characters (*Hán tự*; it’s what you probably think it is: hanzi, hanja, kanji) as well as a modified version known as *chữ Nôm* (“southern characters”) for native words. Unlike Korean and Japanese which developed their own *phonetic* writing systems to help capture their own phonology and native words, Vietnamese went the other (IMHO painful) route and simply extended the Chinese character set with new characters following existing principles of character creation for *chữ Nôm*. The most common method was the phono-semantic compound where you put two characters together to form a new one: one character provides meaning (“semantic”) and the other provides a similar sound (“phono”). This leads to a certain awkwardness where native words have more complex characters than Sino-Vietnamese words and where you kind of need to know written Chinese to understand *chữ Nôm* as the characters for native words used the characters for Sino-Vietnamese words as components. Another level of awkwardness comes from the fact that it was never standardized, so you’ll see a bunch of variants for certain characters. Classical Chinese/Literary Chinese (*hán văn* (漢文)) was used for formal or official and governmental purposes while *chữ Nôm* was used in popular works such as poetry. However, in 1918 *chữ Nôm* and *Hán tự* lost official status in favor of *quốc ngữ*, with *quốc ngữ* having been phased in over the years. Note that this happened in 1918, before China’s introduction of Simplified Chinese: Vietnamese generally used Traditional characters, though long-lived simplified forms do crop up. [Wikipedia’s entry on *chữ Nôm*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ch%E1%BB%AF_N%C3%B4m)


So what does Vietnamese’s importation of Chinese words and its writing system mean for us Genshin players today? Vietnamese has a built-in system for reading Chinese characters! We can look at some non-Genshin examples of this (not going to do any *chữ Nôm*, as it’s a bit out of scope and while it’s been enshrined in Unicode, not many fonts support it). Vietnam’s name (*Việt Nam*) itself is derived from Chinese:

*Việt*: 越

*Nam*: 南

*Việt Nam*: 越南

This follows the Vietnamese word order where adjectives come after the noun. The name has an older form: *Nam Việt*, 南越, or *Nányuè* (“southern Yue”), a reference to being one of the *Bǎiyuè* / 百越 (“hundred Yue”), the collective name for the various tribes living in what’s now southern China and northern Vietnam over 2000 years ago.


We can also look at the name of Vietnam’s capital Hanoi: *Hà Nội* / 河內 (“inside the river"").
Fun fact: Hanoi used to be known as *Đông Kinh* / 東京 where we get the western word “Tonkin” from. Weebs out there might recognize that kanji ;)


One word that blew my mind was *chuẩn bị* / 準備 (“to get ready/prepare”). Mandarin, Cantonese, Korean, and Japanese speakers may recognize this one just from the *quốc ngữ*.

___
__Part 2: Reading notes__


As a reading note, if you are unfamiliar with Vietnamese, Vietnamese is a tonal language, a feature that English does not have. In addition, the *quốc ngữ* romanization’s origins are Portuguese and French and reflect the pronunciation of letters in those languages at the time so English speakers may be a tad confused (the good old “how do you pronounce “Nguyễn” problem”). Vietnamese also has more vowels than English. I’ll try to communicate some pronunciation guidance for each name (in US English), but I won’t go into tones since that’s more of a Vietnamese lesson (feel free to ask, though). Note in Vietnamese there are two kinds of ‘d’: ‘d’ and ‘đ’. ‘đ’ has the hard ‘d’ sound we’re used to in English. ‘d’ is a bit funky: in northern Vietnamese it has a ‘z’ sound like ‘zap’ while in southern Vietnamese it has a ‘y’ sound like ‘yap’. If you want to try hearing how the tones work and some of the more detailed pronunciation, you can get Google Translate to read it for you.


As another note I speak the southern dialect of Vietnamese, which has some differences from the standard northern dialect. I’m pretty sure I described the northern pronunciations in my readings, but please correct me when I’m wrong.


I highly encourage that you check out the Cantonese reading post above. You may actually see some similarities on how things are read: Cantonese tracks Middle Chinese pronunciations better than Mandarin. An interesting thing about Vietnamese is that some “s” and “ts” sounds in Chinese languages took on or shifted towards more of a “t” and “th” sound, for example the number 3:


三 (“three”):  
Mandarin (pinyin): *sān*  
Cantonese (Yale): *sāam*  
Sino-Vietnamese: *tam*  

(You check it out some more in this aforementioned [Wikipedia article about Sino-Xenic pronunciations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sino-Xenic_pronunciations))


As another note, some characters have different readings depending on region, for example the 本 in 日本 (“Japan”, *Nippon*) is read as *bản* in northern Vietnamese (short ‘a’ sound, like “apple”) and *bổn* in southern Vietnamese (long ‘o’ sound, like “oak”).


For methodology, I’m using some online tools to help me out here:

* [Từ điển Hán Nôm ""Sino-Vietnamese dictionary""](https://hvdic.thivien.net/)
* [Nôm Foundation’s Nôm Lookup Tool](http://www.nomfoundation.org/nom-tools/Nom-Lookup-Tool?uiLang=en)
* [Nôm Foundation’s digital version of Prof. Nguyễn Quang Hồng’s *Nôm Characters with Quotations and Annotations*](http://www.nomfoundation.org/nom-tools/Tu-Dien-Chu-Nom-Dan_Giai?uiLang=en)
* [Nôm Foundation’s digital version of Trần Trọng Dương’s *A Dictionary of 15th Century Ancient Vietnamese*](http://www.nomfoundation.org/nom-tools/Nguyen-Trai-Quoc-Am-Tu-Dien?uiLang=en)
* [Nôm Foundation’s digital version of the *Truyện Kiều/傳翹/”Tale of Kieu”*](http://www.nomfoundation.org/nom-project/Tale-of-Kieu?uiLang=en)  
Helpful for cross referencing romanizations and characters, being an actual work of literature.
* [Wiktionary](https://en.wiktionary.org/)  
Really useful for finding variants of characters and comparing pronunciation between CJKV.


These will help me find the readings of characters as well as help me narrow down which reading to use. I’ll also be erring on the side of Sino-Vietnamese readings instead of the nativized readings since the nativized words tend to have either changes in meaning or significant pronunciation shifts. In addition I’ll be referring to the Genshin wiki’s and random other discussions on the meaning of names to help pick a reading.

__Part 3: Readings__


I’ve only briefly looked at the Vietnamese translation for the game, checking location names in Liyue more than anything so I can’t actually speak to the quality of the translation. However, people’s names are left in pinyin without tone diacritics. From what I’ve seen the translators did a good job with the location names...except for Liyue itself, which is left untranslated, so let’s start with that:


__Location(s)__


* __Liyue (璃月, *Líyuè*)__: *Li Nguyệt*  
What a doozy to start on: we get the Nguyễn problem off the bat! *Li* is pronounced like “Lee” (easy enough). The *-uyệt* sounds like “uwee-it” but compacted. Let’s tackle “Ng-”: it sounds like you’re putting “nuh” and “guh” together for “nguh” (but replace the “uh” with the appropriate vowel sound: in this case the “uwee-it”). All together:  
__Lee-nguweeit__  
(By extension, a more accurate English rendering of “Nguyễn” than “win” would be nguwee-in)


__Current Characters__


* __Beidou (北斗, *Běidǒu*)__: *Bắc Đẩu*  
__Buck-dow/doe__ (shamelessly stolen from the Cantonese post), where the second character is sort of a mix between “dow” (rhymes with “cow”) and “doe”. Pretty similar to the Cantonese pronunciation.


* __Chongyun (重云, *Chóngyún*)__: *Trùng Vân*  
There are two readings for 重, so I picked “trùng” as it has the closest meaning to the “layered clouds” interpretation of his name.  
__Joong-vun__, where “-oo-” rhymes with “food” and “vun” rhymes with “nun”. In southern Vietnamese, “v” can have a “y” sound, making it sound like Jong-yun.


* __Keqing (刻晴, *Kèqíng*)__: *Khắc Tình*  
__Cut-ding__, where the “cut’ has a sort of breathy “kh”sound. We see the initial “t” sound with the second character. In southern Vietnamese the final *-nh* does not have a ‘g’ sound so it’s more of a cut-din.


* __Ningguang (凝光, *Níngguāng*)__: *Ngưng Quang*  
__Ngoong-gwang__, where the “oo” rhymes with “book” and “gwang”’s ‘a’ is short as in “apple”. Recall the “Ng-” from *Li Nguyệt*: it sounds like you’re putting “nuh” and “guh” together for “nguh” (but replace the “uh” with the appropriate vowel sound: in this case the b”oo”k).


* __Qiqi (七七, *Qīqī*)__: *Thất Thất*  
__Tut-tut__, rhymes with “cut-cut”. Another victim of the “t”/”th” sounds (this will be a recurring theme).


* __Xiangling (香菱, *Xiānglíng*)__: *Hương Lăng*  
__Hoong-lang/lung__, where the “oo” rhymes with “book” and “lang” sounds like a cross between “lang” and “lung”. We see here the Cantonese and Vietnamese lining up with the first character. The non-Sino-Vietnamese reading of 香 is *nhang*.


* __Xingqiu (行秋, *Xíngqiū*)__: *Hành Thu*  
__Hang-too__, where the “ang” sounds like a mix between “ang” and “eng” but more on the “ang” side. Like with Keqing, in southern Vietnamese the final *-nh* does not have a ‘g’ sound so it’s more of a han-too. The first character has a similar leading “h” sound with the Cantonese reading.


* __Xinyan (辛焱, *Xīnyàn*)__: *Tân Diễm*  
__Done-zeam__, where “zeam” rhymes with “beam”. In the southern Vietnamese, the *d-* has a ""y"" sound, so it would sound like done-yeam. Also sounds similar to the Cantonese reading.


* __Zhongli (钟离, *Zhōnglí*)__: *Chung Li*  
Geo daddy himself.   
__Joong-lee__, where “oo” rhymes with “food”. The non-Sino-Vietnamese reading of 钟 / 鐘 is *chuông*, something that should be more familiar for Vietnamese speakers.



__Upcoming Characters__


* __Ganyu (甘雨, *Gānyǔ*)__: *Cam Vũ*  
__Gam-voo__. Neither character means “coconut” or “goat”. Similarly with Chongyun, in southern Vietnamese “v” can have a “y” sound, making it sound like gam-yoo.


* __Xiao (魈, *Xiāo*)__: *Tiêu*  
__Deew__, like “eew” (disgust). This one is a bit interesting: this particular character is pretty obscure as far as the Vietnamese resources I looked at go. I’m curious as to how rare this character is in Chinese.


* __Baizhu (白术, *Báizhú*)__: *Bạch Thuật*  
__Back-twut__, where second character rhymes with “what”. Similar to the Cantonese reading with the first character and second character, the “th” aside.



* __Hu Tao (胡桃, *Hú Táo*)__: *Hồ Đào*  
Hoe-dow, where “dow” rhymes with “cow”.  
Her name’s translation on the Genshin wiki threw me and is currently throwing me in a loop. Walnut? Pecan? Some mainland-born Mandarin speakers I asked recognize those characters as “pecan” and a US-born Cantonese speaker I asked hasn’t seen those used to refer to walnuts before. It’d be great if someone could comment on this: this is keeping me up at night.



As a final piece of fun, we can read Zhongli’s elemental burst quote as well (no, it does not directly translate to “I will have order”): 天动万象 / 天動萬象

* __天, *tiān*__: *thiên*
* __动 / 動, *dòng*__: *động*
* __万 / 萬, *wàn*__: *vạn*
* __象, *xiàng*__: *tượng*


If you’re interested in the meaning, [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Genshin_Impact/comments/k9xmqd/%E5%A4%A9%E5%8A%A8%E4%B8%87%E8%B1%A1i_will_have_order/) has some good discussion.

                  /
                /
              /
           𒆙


Anyway, hope you learned something interesting!

EDITS:

* Chongyun's *Chồng Vân* -&gt; *Trùng Vân*; thanks u/LingrahRath for pointing out my error! So sorry about that! Embarassingly, I don't know why I initially picked *Chồng* when *Trọng* and *Trùng* are the only real Sino-Vietnamese options while *Chồng* is a non-Sino-Vietnamese reading...
* Xinyan's *Tân Yên* -&gt; *Tân Diễm*; I ended up going through these again and checking and found another mistake of mine where I used a non-Sino-Vietnamese reading...I should get some sleep.

Their purpose is to attempt fate adjustments/repair on worlds of ""younger version"" and so is the other sibling. !&lt;  
\-- also an update--

&gt;!This Mondstad destruction has already happened in future alternate realities/worlds (at least once or twice).  As a direct result the surving mondstadt heroes (in the future realities) reformed to fight/manipulate/guard this fate in the younger worlds -as the Fatui). So there are some infiltrators that have manipulated the travelers (looking at Amber and Sucross), but my infered speculation of its members  is Bennet ( Pantalone), Albedo (Puppet), Amber ( Pedrelino fool) , Klee ( Pulcinella /rooster?), Sucross (moth),  Noel  (Signora?) !&lt;

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;!speculating Fatui Amber was the one that the Travler fist meet (and caused the traveler to attack Hilchurls... and thus alter history) and the more intelligent Sucross that sent the Travler to dragon spire was the moth -not the present worlds version.

Genshin_Impact,2021,1,"Hi everyone, I'm just a casual dolphin that wanted to drop some knowledge for those that are struggling a bit on the event. I made a [youtube video](https://youtu.be/q2ai3KErjd0), but it's pretty shit because I suffer from crippling anxiety. The channel is more personal practice for public speaking during my COVID break if anything. Feel free to check it out if you're bored, but this written guide should be more informative. This guide isn't really for the sweaty speed runners, but more for casual players that want a less stressful clear at an acceptable pace. 

**Table of context**

I. Suggested Setup

II. Shield Break Phase

III. Neutral Phase

IV. Burn Phase

V. Blizzard Phase

**I. Suggested Setup**

The requirements for this style of clear isn't too heavy as even F2P accounts should have access the characters. The only downside is that if you haven't already put resources into the new weapon, your clear may take additional rotations.

* The first requirement is Amber. As much as we meme on her, she fulfills a niche role that only she can do.
   * She's the only ranged character that can deal meaningful damage to the core from the safety of the bubble during the blizzard phase.
   * Her burst deals tons of damage to the weak spot due to the large size of the cryo regisvine. 
* The second requirement is more of a heavy suggestion, which is another pyro character. 
   * While other elements will work, pyro works quickest. 
   * This also provides pyro resonance for more damage. 
   * The quicker the fight ends the less likely the encounter will go wrong due to human error or the many bugs that plague this fight.
   * For low rarity accounts, I suggest Bennett or Xangling as they're really good at breaking the ground weak point. Level investment is usually just for survival. Quick swap characters like Xangling can be extremely underleveled without much issues. 
      * Bennett has reduced skill cooldown within his Burst, allowing him to get many attacks off on the weak point.
      * Xangling can drop her bear and quickly swap to safety.
* Last suggestion is a sword DPS character. 
   * I used keqing in my video, but I've also tested it out on my level 60 Bennett at AR50 and it works alright (3 burns). The stat bonuses are really strong in this event and I've been seeing a lot of traditional support out damaging the usual dilucs/klees in multiplayer. 
   * I used a standard gladiator set since I haven't had the chance to artifact farm heavily. It's mostly ATK% with 2-3 good sub stats, so if you have a real set you're likely in a good spot. 
   * This being said, if you've got nothing else, the fight should still be relatively safe if you really need to use your diluc/klee.

**II. Shield Break Phase**

The first phase is rather chill and you're unlikely to die unless you jump in guns blazing because the regisvine also opens up with deadly force. Outside of breaking shields, you're really just casually strolling and perhaps charging up burst until the phase ends.

* Regisvine opens up with a barrage of icicles, which deal tons of damage. Then they explode, which does tons of damage. These explosions also leave behind ice, which is also annoying.
   * Expect to be nearly 1 shotted in multiplayer if you're not careful
   * It's best to just spend this portion of the fight running in a circle dodging. You can pull enemies away from  these areas of danger in the meanwhile.
   * It's not terrible as the cyro regisvine sort of just chills for a long while after the initial barrage.
* To end the phase you gather Scarlet quartz from dead enemies to break the frozen crystals surrounding the shield.
   * In single player this is usually very easy as the slimes tend to die in 1-2 hits.
   * In multiplayer I prefer fighting the flowers because big slimes have a shield that can absorb quite a bit of damage. The jump is also disruptive in both terms of knock back and just waiting for it to land.
   * It maybe worth dropping an extra Scarlet Quartz to get some early burst on the next phase.

**III. Neutral Phase**

Neutral is probably the most dangerous phase because of the wide range of attacks and can be the most frustrating phase because of how little damage you see until the phase ends.

* The cryo regisvine in dragonspine isn't much different from the standard one in terms of attacks. You're mostly just smacking its weak points between its large telegraphed attacks.
   * The ideal time to use most of your burst is at the start of the phase or after the Regisvine gets its head stuck in the ice.
   * The Boss has some sort of new attack that leaves an icy patch in melee range. DO NOT STEP ON THIS without heavy healing or all. Take the time to do something more productive like reseting the cold gauge that you probably haven't noticed till now. 
   * If you're a casual like me and find Invincibility frame dodging the wide melee attacks to be too much, consider using the new food device to heal up in a pinches. They shouldn't be able to 1 shot you.
      * Do not expect your healer in multiplayer to heal you up if you're close to dead. 
* Before the weak point goes down, consider the order of your rotation.

**IV. Burn Phase**

The most satisfying phase, but will tend to vary depending on experience.

* As previously stated, have your order ready before the weak point breaks, especially if you're doing a big setup like Childe's, which can take out about half the hp bar if done right.
* Make sure your Viridescent venerer set lands on the correct element. It's the most consistent source of damage if you're using some sort of weapon infusion. Keqing and Diluc come to mind.
* Characters that can setup elemental reaction easily with field effects are what you're looking for. Melt, Vaporize, and super conduct are likely the ones you're looking for. However, this is one of the few encounters where overload is decent.
* The encounter can actually end here if your damage rotation is good or lucky enough.
   * However, if it's not, keep an eye out for a notification on your map for the next phase.

**V. Blizzard Phase**

A marker should appear on your map when this phase is about to start unless the game bugs out. This game bugs out a lot. In a full multiplayer squad I've seen it deal around 16k hp of damage easily, so don't try to tank it unless you have to. Break the structure at the end of the marker to activate a shield.

* Use this time to heal up the party if needed.
   * You might not need to if the next burn will end the encounter.
* This is where your level 1 Amber will shine.
   * 4 shots will break the weak point on its head and you avoid an unnecessary neutral phase.
      * Aim slightly above to correct for arrow drop
      * Make sure the arrow is fully charged or else it wont count.
      * If done right, you skip to your next burn phase.
      * If done wrong, you've got to fight it at neutral, which can be hard if the boss decides to blizzard repeatedly.
* If the boss isn't dead by the 2nd burn, you sort of just run around and avoid damage until the weak point regrows.
   * The damage at neutral isn't worth while.
   * The boss may blizzard more than usual, which is fine if you've brought amber.",1609473299

Should I ""waste"" a BP on refinement for the Black Sword for when I need physical dps. Or get Ning the Solar Pearl?

Genshin_Impact,2021,1,"It just feels disappointing that the lore of Dragonspine was not really expounded. There were several key details revealed in the first act that were really interesting but was never touched upon again later on. 

Add to that the awkward ending. The final act revealed that Festering Desire is powerful enough to revive a fallen regisvine. And when we defeat it, Albedo just goes ""yep, dat sword is gud."" There is no resolution to the story or at least the smaller lores (e.g. entombed city, Durin's heart (?) in the valley, scattered emergency kits, Albedo's identity, etc). The event just climaxed on the fact that the sword is powerful---something that the first three acts have already established. The previous meteorite event had a far more satisfying conclusion.

Edit: Thanks for the clarification there is an Act V of some sort. I played the last act in the meteorite event kinda late so there was no ""wait days"" between the third act and the conclusion. Kinda thought it was the same with this. Sorry for the rant.

Edit2: Okay, just did Act V and it was underwhelming. So I guess my point still stands.",1609475920

**Let me note,** I do not know every piece of lore in the game so I’m sorry for anything incorrect. Compared to Zhongli and Childe, the other write-ups I did, Albedo is shrouded in a lot of unknowns. Of course, I’m going to be talking about his personality, but I also want to touch on his relationship to Khaerni’ah and Celestia, which isn’t as definitive as saying, “this who Albedo is and his personality, this is what his skill names mean and the connections he has, etc.” So if I say anything incorrect, I feign my innocence.

**TLDR:**

* People all throughout Tevyat come to meet Albedo, due to him being a genius and his innovative way of thinking. It is very likely, at this point, he is one of the smartest people in Tevyat.
* Albedo lacks social skills and chooses to forego, most of the time, relationships as they hinder his time for experimenting and study. Despite this Albedo still holds close relationships with Klee, Sucrose &amp; Timaeus, and the Traveler.
* Despite Albedo’s overall likeable personality, Rosaria is very skeptical of him and tells the Traveler to not trust him. Albedo is said to harbor a power that can possibly destroy Mondstadt and, he said himself, he may one day go out of control.
* Rhinedottir, Albedo’s master, created the homunculus which eventually became Albedo, most likely using the Art of Khemia. After the two of them found the heart of an Archon (or God), she left him with the task to find the truth and meaning of the world.
* It is very likely, due to Albedo being a homunculus, that he lacks emotions.
* Albedo has connections to the Ancient Civilization, plus both Khaenri’ah &amp; Celestia.

**Word Count: 3823**

**Edit**:There’s a few incorrect statements in this post. People have corrected me in the comments, so go there if you see something wrong, it might already be said ↓

# Albedo Analysis

**Bread and Butter:**

“Albedo — an alchemist based in Mondstadt, in the service of the Knights of Favonius. . . The pursuit of fortune and connections cannot hold a candle to his heart's desire — acquiring the limitless, obscure knowledge left behind by previous generations of scholars.”

I think, for some, their first impressions of Albedo was that he was going to be some snobby, I’m-better-than-you Alchemist. After all, before 1.2 our only look at Albedo was through other character voicelines. Then, when his character demo eventually came out, the first thing he does is roast Timaeus (~~poor Timaeus can’t catch a break~~).

Perhaps, this is just *my* skewed opinion on a minority of other people’s opinions, but I can’t say the notion wasn’t there.

**So who really is Albedo?**

**Meat and Potatoes:**

# The Passionate Outlander  — Albedo

We are first introduced to Albedo through his character story, *Princeps Cretaceus: Act I*, a prerequisite to the ongoing event *The Chalk Prince and the Dragon*.

Sucrose tells the Traveler that, “Albedo is the Knights of Favonius' Chief Alchemist. . . he's dedicated himself to investigating the truth of this world, and has made many important breakthroughs. We often get alchemists coming to Mondstadt from all over Teyvat, seeking his help. They say that the subtlest of guidance from Mr. Albedo helps them to solve the most unfathomable of problems” (*Princeps Cretaceus: Act I* ).

“Albedo is quite the alchemist. Just say the word and he'll come up with a good solution” (*Lisa - About Albedo*).

**It’s no joke — Albedo is probably, if not is, the smartest person in Tevyat.** People come all the way to the edge of Tevyat, to bumpkin city Mondstadt, just to hear the man’s wisdom.

Despite all this, Albedo would never call himself a “genius”.

**The best way** ***I*** **can describe Albedo would be, INTP.**

INTP (Introvert, Intuitive, Thinking, Perspective)  is one of the 16 generalized personality types based on the Myers-Briggs Type indicator. The indicator's goal is to indicate one's psychological preferences, by assigning four categories. Now, I’m no master of the Myers-Briggs test, but this is pretty damn close to Albedo’s personality, give or take a letter.

\- - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

**Now, let’s look at Albedo’s social skills, or lack thereof.**

&amp;#x200B;

[Screenshot from Princeps Cretaceus: Act I](https://preview.redd.it/rks1xopozq861.jpg?width=2159&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4f089de2a49fd3dd7ef5a88bb2d400143bc0c58d)

In *Princeps Cretaceus: Act I*, Albedo and the Traveler discuss what it means to be, and the consequences, of the ordinary and unordinary. Because of Albedo’s upbringing, he considers himself to be the unordinary, and at the end of *Princeps Cretaceus: Act I* he says that both the Traveler and him are alike, “composed of a substance that has yet to be fully defined”.

Albedo: “The good thing about ‘ordinary’ is that everything is an object of reference, and everyone understands you. People are the same, they can understand, empathize, encourage, and support one another. But a peculiar person. . . They don't have much recourse (source for help) for things we take for granted. The essence of their life is fundamentally different” (*Princeps Cretaceus: Act I*).

**Though Albedo never outright says,** ***I’m lonely,*** (*because I’m fundamentally different from others, and they can’t help me because of that, plus I bear the weight of possibly, accidentally destroying the entirety of Mondstadt*) **we can assume based on multiple lines that he, at least, harbors some amount of loneliness.**

Even if we factor out the very likely possibility of Albedo being lonely in some fashion, we are still left with a man lacking in the social-skills department.

Take for instance the scene, a the beginning of the 3rd Act of *The Chalk Prince and the Dragon* with Cyrus:

**Ex.**

[Screenshot from the Chalk Prince and the Dragon: Act III](https://preview.redd.it/fy97izgrzq861.jpg?width=1861&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8138822c608917886470d44efee09f8a17b8d8a4)

Cyrus goes on to passionately ramble about adventuring, while Albedo replies in yeses and headshakes (plus the developers even use his idle animation at some point). This isn’t because Albedo garners any ill-will to Cyrus — he, simply, just doesn’t care. **Albedo seems to do his best at removing all existential factors that hinder his time for research and studying.**

Mona comments, “Albedo? Ah. . . I envy his ability to solely focus on his research without getting bogged down in mundane worldly affairs.”

“Relationships are. . . quite troublesome. . . This taxing cycle (maintaining relationships) requires a lot of time. . .” (*About Albedo - Socializing*).

**But all of this isn’t to say he isn’t capable of building a relationship or interacting.**

**Take for example:**

* **Klee**
   * “. . . I view Klee as my younger sister” (*Albedo - About Klee*).
   * “‘We'll be a family from now on, treat her like a real younger sister!’ From that day forth, remedying Klee's disasters would come to take up most of Albedo's remaining energy. . .” (*Albedo’s 2nd Character Story*).
   * Did you know, Klee is the second character to show up in another featured character’s demo, the first one being Jean in *Klee: Da-Da-Da!*. At the end of *Albedo: Contemplation in Chalk*, they play a bar of music similar to the music played in Klee’s demo trailer.
* **Sucrose and Timaeus**
   * Working with Sucrose on alchemy research is quite pleasant, but she has some. . . stubborn qualities in regards to certain aspects unrelated to research” (*Albedo- About Sucrose - Habits*).
   * “As his Assistant I learn so much each and every day” (*Sucrose- About Albedo - Artistry*).
   * In Sucrose’s 4th character story, it is said that Albedo planned a mandatory week vacation for her, seeing that she was on the brink of exhaustion after a prolonged experiment.
   * Both Sucrose and Timaeus are Albedo’s students, with Sucrose namely being his assistant. Sucrose shows up alongside Albedo in *Albedo: Still Life and Creation* and Timaeus is mentioned in *Albedo: Contemplation in Chalk*.
* **The Traveler**
   * “In the future. . . If the need arises. . . Can I solicit your help again? Well. . . Glad I can count on you” (*Princeps Cretaceus: Act I*).
   * “You. . . want to accompany me while I experiment? I'm honored. Oh, don't be nervous” (*Albedo- About Us - Experiments*).
   * At the end of *Princeps Cretaceus: Act I* Paimon asks Albedo if she can be his friend, because she “really wants to”.

Despite Albedo, himself, not being one to socialize, he is said to have an all-around likeable personality. “Albedo eh? Calm, collected, and incredibly talented. He's the type everybody likes, some even more so than others” (*Kaeya- About Albedo*).

**Except there is one person who is** ***very*** **skeptical of Albedo. . .**

\- - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

[Screenshot from Princeps Cretaceus: Act I](https://preview.redd.it/a9oqj6muzq861.jpg?width=2055&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=be2ef893251ab8e0e2555ade4f43ae10ae7c34c0)

Much like Diluc or Jean, Rosaria, though never stated, is a protector of Mondstadt, but not in the same way as the aforementioned names.

She says, “We can’t go turning a blind eye to hidden dangers can we? **Why shouldn’t Sisters have a sense of justice**?” (*Princeps Cretaceus: Act I*).

Her day-job, aside from being a nun, is also alluded to in other character’s voicelines:

* “Some may see Sister Rosaria as one who complains about how bothersome her work is, but she does her job well. Last time I saw her I told her she could come find me should she ever need help. . . I need to work harder to become of more assistance to the people of Mondstadt” (*Jean- About Rosaria)*.
* “One night, I heard her invoking the name of the Archon thus in another's presence: ‘May you be struck down in the name of Lord Barbatos!’” (*Fischl- About Rosaria*).

The start of *Princeps Cretaceus: Act I* begins with Rosaria guiding the Traveler up the mountain to see Albedo. As the Act plays out, Rosaria watches from the shadows, and finally, at the end of the Act, Rosaria reveals herself. She goes on to interrogate the Traveler, telling them that they should not be so trusting of Albedo.

**Why is Rosaria so skeptical of Albedo, after all he is stated to be a pretty nice dude?**

Part of it is that she’s skeptical of any outsider or threat to Mondstadt. In *Princeps Cretaceus: Act I*, she contemplates to herself, “I wonder. . . Does this (the Traveler) constitute a risk to Mondstadt?”

But, the other part of it is that Albedo harbors some super secret, evil power that can possibly destroy the entirety of Mondstadt. Naturally, Rosaria’s going to be untrusting of Albedo.

**Ex.**

* “If one day, I lose control. . . Destroy Mondstadt. . . Destroy everything. . . Can I rely on you to stop me?” (*Princeps Cretaceus: Act I*).
* “Same reason the purest soil gave birth to human life. . . It's an ancient power with unmistakable properties. Trying to harness it is dangerous indeed, I can't imagine what would happen if someone lost control of it in the city. . .” (*Venti- About Albedo*).
* “Beyond this, the young man is a stranger to them, a complete mystery and the essence of his knowledge is equally unknown. But I know it well. . . If Albedo were to ever make a single wrong move. . . I could not let myself ignore it” (*Albedo: Kreideprinz*).

When Dainsleif, the person who talked passively about the terrorist who unleashed Osial on Liyue, talks mad shit, you know he’s serious. **So how did Albedo acquire this unknown power?**

**Well. . . no one knows the exact linguistics, but the best assumption is that it was acquired through his birth — made by the Art of Khemia.** Let’s not beat around the bush, Albedo is a homunculus.

His 3rd character story states: “‘The chalk: that is you (Albedo). The earth is where alchemy gets its name, and is the basis of all life’”.

&amp; His 5th character story states: “‘Chalk is the spotless soil, and was used to make primordial man. . . From soil was birthed chalk’. . . Such incomprehensible statements are bound up in the memories of his master. His master was not his birth mother, but Albedo has no doubt that his life stems from her nonetheless”.

There’s also:

**\*NOTE:** *Since I know nothing of the Magnum Opus, let me direct your attention to this post, credits to chouginga\_hentai, which goes into the nitty-gritty behind Albedo’s skill names:* [*Useless Name Trivia: Albedo*](https://www.reddit.com/r/Genshin_Impact/comments/kaeb84/useless_name_trivia_albedo/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)*. I also want to say that the skill Flower of Eden, which isn’t discussed in the linked post, seems to be in reference to the Bible. The Garden of Eden was an “earthly paradise inhabited by the first created man and woman. . . prior to their expulsion for disobeying the commandments of God” (*[*Link*](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Garden-of-Eden#:~:text=Garden%20of%20Eden%2C%20in%20the,disobeying%20the%20commandments%20of%20God.&amp;text=The%20term%20Eden%20probably%20is,eden%2C%20meaning%20%E2%80%9Cplain.%E2%80%9D)*). Eden may also, though I highly doubt it, be in reference to Mihoyo’s other game Honkai Impact 3rd, with the 9th God Key’s weapons, Key of Devouring Series, all using the term Eden in their names.*

**The use for the Art of Khemia was to create life, since there were very few fauna in Khaenri’ah. This power also eventually led to the destruction of Khaernri’ah as said by Dainsleif himself, who was there to witness the fall of Khaernri’ah.**

**If the Art of Khemia, the power to create life, is so dangerous why is Albedo using it?**

After his master, Rhinedottir, and he found the heart of Naberius, presumably the heart of one of the Archons or Gods, Rhinedottir left, leaving him one final task — “show me the truth and the meaning of this world”.

[Screenshot from Princeps Cretaceus: Act I](https://preview.redd.it/nkgdt5u00r861.jpg?width=2051&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f4bc4575cd1da43b636a601bd0bb174fe736419d)

*Princeps Cretaceus: Act I* ends with Albedo finally creating life with his otherworldly seed, thanks to the help of Traveler. *I’m* going to assume that by testing what can and cannot be created inside the realm of Tevyat, Albedo is testing the boundaries of the laws of Tevyat and, by doing that, is searching for the truth and meaning of Tevyat.

\- - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

**Not only does Albedo lack social skills, he also seems to lack intense emotions, most likely due to his homuncular nature.**

In the third act of *The Chalk Prince and the Dragon* a group of Hilichurls steal Albedo’s sketchbook, causing some damage to the book in the process.

Let’s propose a simple question — if someone were to destroy something of yours that you put much time and effort into, it can be anything, would you be angry? The answer doesn’t have to necessarily be angry, but perhaps you would feel some *strong* emotions.

**The same cannot be said about Albedo.**

Paimon asks, “If the sketchbook had been severely damaged, you’d be furious, wouldn’t you?” (*The Chalk Prince and the Dragon: Act III*).

And Albedo replies, “What leads you to believe that. . . I wouldn’t fly into rage over such a thing” (*The Chalk Prince and the Dragon: Act III*).

**Okay, that’s only one instance, so maybe he’s just a very calm dude?**

In *Albedo: Still Life and Creation*, Albedo begins to paint a common Vishap, but in spite of the Vishap’s lacking lower-half Albedo decides to bring it to life regardless. Sucrose says afterwards, “Excuse me, Mr. Albedo, but I fear creating such creatures may sit outside the sphere of acceptability within our role as alchemists''.

Albedo, seemingly lacking empathy for what would come to be, created and left the poor Vishap looking like a doodle-bob creation. And says, to Sucrose, that he didn’t know that was unacceptable.

Aside from these 2 examples, there’s also this ascension line, implying his emotions still needed ‘refining’.

**Ex.**

* “Rubedo in alchemy refers to the refining of feeling. **I feel the refining of my own emotions is also thanks to you**” (*Albedo- Feelings About Ascension - Climax*).

Congratz! You made it to the last section of this analysis ( ͡° ͜ ͡°)

**Dessert:**

# Albedo, Khaenri’ah, and Celestia

[Cecilia shown in Albedo: Contemplation in Chalk](https://preview.redd.it/6p5uzck30r861.jpg?width=2177&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6ff23ef2f27ea7aa25c7eed503952aa017dc3204)

I don’t think anyone will deny Albedo’s connections to Khaenri’ah, so let’s begin with the known.

For some of character’s, their ascension material, common and/or specialty, is based around their character.

**Ex.**

* Diluc used to hunt down the Fatui → Insignias
* Jean is the Dandelion Knight, Protector of Mondstadt → Dandelion Seeds
* Ningguang has similarities with Guizhong, plus she’s the Qixing → Glaze Lilies
* Childe lived on a seaside village and is part of the Fatui → Starconches &amp; Insignias

**Albedo’s ascension mats are Cecilias and Scrolls.**

In the past, Cecilias were a flower cultivated by the **Ancient Civilization**.

“The Cecilia flowers that only grow on high cliffs once bloomed in the greenhouses here. The ancient civilization that once enjoyed the scent of the Cecilia was lost, and so too was the sea of white flowers” (*Cecilia Garden*).

Scrolls are used by Samachurls and are described as, “A scroll inscribed with ancient images. It is said that few can decipher its meaning, and the few scholars that have all went mad”.

On the art of the *Forbidden Cursed Scroll* you can see the same characters as seen on Ruin Guards, which are known to be connected to both the Ancient Civilization and the Abyss.

**Before Albedo arrived at Mondstadt and joined the Knights of Favonius, on Alice’s recommendation, Rhinedottir and he traversed the Domains of Tevyat.** “From birth, he was already adventuring deep within domains with his master” (*Albedo's 3rd Character Story*).

The most infamous Domain in-game, the Spiral Abyss, is described as, “A massive underground city constructed by an Ancient Civilization long gone. To this day, the purpose of this underground city remains unknown. Its structure is divided into the ‘Abyss Corridor,’ which connects worlds, and the ‘Abyssal Moon Spire,’ which leads to the unknown. It is now collectively called the ‘Spiral Abyss’. . .”

**Albedo has ties to the Ancient Civilization, seeing that he traversed the Domains constructed by said civilization and that he teaches the art of alchemy, “an ancient art”.**

**\*NOTE:** *The Ancient Civilization doesn’t necessarily mean Khaenri’ah, but it is very likely that Khaenri’ah took after the Ancient Civilization, repeating their same mistakes which led to their downfall. I’ve seen some say the Ancient Civilization and Khaenri’ah are the same, and I, too, thought they were the same at one point, but pondering about it further that doesn’t seem to be the case. The Ancient Civilization is “long gone”. Yes, Khaenri’ah fell over 500 years ago, but if we use Rex Lapis’s age as a point of reference, for the timeline of Tevyat, then the fall of Khaenri’ah only occurred a short while ago (500/6000). But of course, long gone is really vague terms and, I won’t deny, 500 years is a long time.*

\- - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

[Example Image](https://preview.redd.it/yyle66q50r861.jpg?width=1015&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e4ac24026447ded90848c1d2358af1fc56510cf8)

**Khaenri’ah and Celestia are closely interlinked.** I couldn’t tell you the details behind how the two are connected, but, surely, the two are connected in some fashion. In-game you can see shared motifs between the two, most notably shown in the Frescoes in the secret room.

One of the two is depicted by the crescent moon and a star while the other is depicted by a star atop another star.

The crescent moon can be seen on the middle Fresco in the secret room and can also be found on the Wings of Companionship, which also depicts the star atop another star. Aside from the glider, this symbol can also be found in Albedo’s constellation as shown in the image above. It is depicted above the fetus as if it was, or is, the source nurturing the fetus.

**\*NOTE:** *At this point, I’m not sure which symbol goes to Khaenri’ah and which goes to Celestia.  I personally assumed that star atop another star when to Celestia, since Hero's Wits are described as material used to in “Tevyat in order to be closer to Celestia” and on Hero’s Wits you can see a depiction of, what I assume, is the Sky Island made by a bunch of stars. You can also find a star on both Statue of the Sevens, near the bottom of the statue. But, then again,  you can also see the star atop another star on Kaeya’s clothing. So, my point is, that I’m not sure which goes to which. Sorry if this paragraph is/was really convoluted (つ﹏&lt;)･ﾟ｡*

**Now, let me turn your attention to this, Constellation 4: Descent of Divinity**

The Divine, as of now, is always in reference to the beings of Celestia.

**Ex.**

* “But even she knows not to make an enemy of the Divine” (*Tevyat Chapter Storyline Preview*).
* “Her followers hope only to be on her side when the day of her rebellion against the Divine comes at last” (*Tevyat Chapter Storyline Preview*).

Why exactly does Albedo have a skill name that uses the term Divinity, if not in reference to Celestia? Even if this skill name isn’t in reference to the Divine, there’s no denying Albedo’s connection to Khaenri’ah which is inherently connected to Celestia.

Aside from the 4th constellation name, Albedo has similar stars (diamonds) plastered on his jacket that the Traveler also has on their outfit. This star (diamond) can also be found on the Traveler’s character screen where the vision would be present.

\- - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

**Before ending this write-up, it’s worth briefly talking about Albedo and Gold.**

Without going in-depth, Gold was also an alchemist creating life, seemingly using the same Art of Khemia. When the downfall of Khaenri’ah occurred they were overtaken by greed and created an army of life-devouring monsters, with power that can rival even the Archon’s power (e.g Durin). These monsters most likely still roam the Abyss today.

Dainsleif’s profile mentions chalk pursues Gold.

**Ex.**

* “Chalk pursues gold, in this time inopportune, the eclipse is swallowed by the crimson moon. The future must atone for bygone mistakes, as the bond familiar falters and breaks— of the same blood, elders and the youth. . . Such is the cycle of the world, in truth” (*Dainsleif’s Introduction*).

**Albedo, the Chalk Prince, is following the same steps as Gold.**

Earlier in this write-up, I talked about how no one knows what powers Albedo holds, but that he does hold some powers of destruction. As said by Dainsleif, the Art of Khemia led to “the destruction of a glorious nation”.

It would make sense if “glorious nation” was in reference to Khaenri’ah, since these are Dainslief’s own words and he, of course, hails from Khaenri’ah.

**Is it possible that Gold, using the same power, also led Khaenri’ah to its destruction?**

In the Honkai multiverse, the universe follows the pattern of advancement → destruction → rebirth, and the pattern repeats. This same principle applies to Genshin. From what I understand, Houkai (the Houkai?) really hate it when humans try to create life. So what Albedo is essentially doing is sending Tevyat down a path of destruction, unknowingly, just like his predecessor Gold.

# In Conclusion

**\*TLDR IS AT THE BEGINNING\***

I hope I didn’t miss anything, but I covered pretty much all I wanted to say. Personally, I’m really excited for where the writers decide to take Albedo, and just all the Mondstadt characters in general. It’s a shame we didn’t get to see him earlier, like what was he doing when Stormterror attacked Mondstadt?

Can I also just say, it was a blessing having all the character stories when writing this because, while Albedo didn’t show up in the actual story aside from the ongoing event, I actually had all 5 character stories to work with this time and, therefore, more material. But more stories doesn’t actually mean good material — I looked at Ganyu’s 5th story and pretty much went wtf. How do we have Diluc’s, Tartgalia’s, and/or Albedo’s character stories and then there’s Ganyu’s ( ಠ ͜ʖಠ)

We're getting too use to one-phasing every boss in the game (yes I know this boss can also be one-phased) so I like that the team is shaking things up a bit. I understand that they need to keep a balance between the casual players and the hardcore players; but I think we can find a happy medium. Making this event Co-op is a nice option for folks who can't do it on their own. I'd personally like to see more challenging content like this in the future. Hopefully they will use this as a stepping stone for future boss battles. Testing our overall game knowledge is the next step in enhancing the overall combat system.",1609480237

Genshin_Impact,2021,1,"So, I've been watching [the video where dansleif appears](https://youtu.be/TAlKhARUcoY), and after reading the comment section, I got kind of worried for the game and the time it will take to be completed, a guy said that the teyvat chapter is one of more chapters, other guys said that there would be another world, an khaenri ah, celestia, abyss chapters, this got me anxious, also due to the shit ton of theories relating people's fate, dansleif, tsaritsa, and etc to the end of the game.
What I'm asking you is: what are your opinions about the actual state of the game, how long do you think it will take to get to the end? And will it be worth or will you have patience to wait who knows how much time to the main story to be completed?",1609480880

I have seen so many posts about asking party comp recommendations.

It's kinda hard to show your character pool with the constellation, and weapon pool by screenshots and you always have to write ""My character pool is Fischl - C1 - Stringless / Klee - C0 - Solar / Xiangling - C0 - Crescent Pike / ..."" in text like this.

&amp;#x200B;

So, I made a website that you can make your team with legibility and share your party link easily!

&amp;#x200B;

You can write a post like ""My character pool is like [https://genshinparty.com/en/e585edea7492](https://genshinparty.com/en/e585edea7492), is there anyone who can recommend my party?""

&amp;#x200B;

Other people can reply to that like ""[https://genshinparty.com/en/e585edea7492?p=13050309](https://genshinparty.com/en/e585edea7492?p=13050309) This main party would be good."" or can leave the party comp below by saving.

&amp;#x200B;

When the completed parties are collected enough, I will try to implement the auto team-building feature through the accumulated data!

Genshin_Impact,2021,1,"This floor is in clear need of a rework, 

the 1st half takes way too long since enemies essentially run away from you, and then when you get to them wasting time and gaining sheer cold they just jump up denying you any chance of hitting them and wasting even more time.

&amp;#x200B;

2nd half is even more outrageous, the fatui are huge damage sponges and deal an insane amount of damage up close, to make things worse most of the time is wasted running away from ice traps an anemo guy that can suck you in leaving the other 3  guys to gang bang you.  there's absolutely no pattern to the fight, no alternating roles for you or your opponents, it's just run away until you no longer can, and off goes your progress cus you'll get one-shotted.

&amp;#x200B;

and that's not even mentioning the bugs, I crashed through the floor once in an ice trap, sucrose ult absorbs the atmospheric cryo element making her pretty much useless, and since abyss mages have dmg shields amber is useless as an anti-shield, for you need her for fatui but not for mages.

Genshin_Impact,2021,1,"Not sure if anyone else has had an idea like this or not, but i recently thought that having a way to potentially reset and maybe even reroll sub-stats on artifacts would probably make the game more enjoyable as we wouldn't need as much luck to get those perfect artifacts. For example once you get an artifact to max level you could have an option (either with or without a certain resource i'm not sure) to reset the artifact to level 0, while giving the option to reroll one of the sub-stats, or just keep your current sub-stats to hopefully get better level ups with those stats.

For example you have a hypothetically almost god tier oblige circlet that you put on you hypothetical zhongli with crit main stat atk%, hp%, crit dmg% and +hp, however when you hypothetically level it up 4 of the 5 level ups go into hp+ and the last in hp%, even though hp is good for zhongli you definitely want more atk% or crit dmg% than hp, especially if its only +hp.

So instead of looking for an artifact that was even better using probably 1000s of resin to get something even close, you just reset the level of the artifact, reroll the +hp, of course with my hypothetical luck it would end up with +def, but i could then level it up and get better bonus stats.

It would make getting the perfect artifact a lot more manageable while still keeping some of the rng aspects and the resource costs, as it does take a lot to max level a 5 star artifact especially if you a rerolling the same one multiple times for the perfect sub-stats, without having to get extremely lucky in domains to maybe get a very slight upgrade.

Also put a number on the artifact to signify the amount of times it has been prestiged, sorta like how formaing works in warframe if anyone knows what i'm talking about, also yes warframe is what i got the idea from.

Edit: i also don't believe this would completely remove the grind for artifacts because A) you wouldn't want to waste to many resources on a bad artifact to make it good and 2) you still have to grind artifacts to keep leveling the artifacts that you are rerolling. ",1609481037

I think Mihoyo did a great job with this new event . It’s challenging, fun and most importantly it’s free to do! I think people are having a hard time understanding that you can’t have everything, and if I had to choose between resin gated content and tedious grind. I would choose tedious grind everyday.

The new Abyss just released overall; I think it is easier than the last one. It is not as Pyro reliant and doesn’t have the Stamina draining mechanic which many didn’t like. Even though 12-3 felt easier to play, less enemies and mechanics to paly around, it’s still a big dps check.

If you got frustrated and therefor didn’t want to do last Abyss 12, I would highly encourage you to try the new one out, it was fun! I personally liked last 12-3 more, Fatuis are my favorite enemies but I like that we got a change!

What do you think of the new Abyss, do think it changed for the better or worse?

Which is only enough to throw six white Artifacts onto something. And those are the high point of Mora from domains (not counting Weeklies, which don't openly state how much Mora they give anyway).

I get that they don't wanna make the Mora Prize Flowers obsolete (though they could've at least scaled up one more time at WL7...), but c'mon. The Mora yield isn't even enough to back up what you're doing at that domain. That's so pathetic that it'd be less insulting if there were just no Mora at all.",1609487429

alot of people have been asking about how much crit rate and crit dmg they should add

peer review welcome. i will amend any mistake i have.

edit : many people have feedback that they rather view the stats window rather than manually calculating the artifact. i have added the final number that you should see in stats window. it is extremely close to 1:2 . character stats gain is too small to put a dent in the stats gain from artifact.

Genshin_Impact,2021,1,"I'm still getting into the lore of the game so i could be very wrong, as this is based only on some voice lines from the Fatui in the game and what i remember reading about them when i first got into the game.

So the Fatui are one part military unit and one part diplomats. they're the special chosen by the tasrista (probably spelling that wrong) and work under the super special favorites of the tasrista, the harbingers. From what i hear from NPCs its clear they aren't well liked and they know it- but they just think its because everyone else is jealous and they just ""don't understand"". 

A NPC fatui comments that he just wants to go home. so does another. most NPC Fatui share sentiments about their home sneznaha (again, another word i'm 100% spelling wrong, sorry) and there is even a commission you get every now and then for getting one some souvenirs because he is sure he'll be going home soon. the diplomats don't want to be here, they want to go home. but whats stopping them? ""their loyalty"" i thought.

And then there are two Fatui enemies with some interesting dialogue.  
One says ""you can't run... well, neither can I."" which i thought was in relation to the fact that the character never really ran and only walked, using their anemo powers to speed themselves up. but then another has this death line ""finally, some peace and quiet."" which when i first heard it felt heart breaking.

this guy just died. and he is HAPPY about it. that line, plus the one from the aneom enemy, and how there are so many fatui diplomats whos didn't want to be out and about on their missions, got me thinking: maybe they're brainwashed into thinking being chosen is a good thing, and that this loyalty is more like Stockholm syndrome. and the smarter, wiser members of the Fatui have figured this out but they can't do anything about it.

after all, they are part of what is considered the strongest (in number and strength) military in the world. They have spies every where, a communication network that probably already knows they know something is up. But most of all, they have people who use Visions and Delusions. a person with two elements has power and authority over them. their friends can't be trusted, and if they try to leave they can't go back home- so what can they do?

Nothing. Except follow the Tasrista's orders, and hope they get to go home soon.",1609490855

I am still spending all my resin on leylines/talent/weapon mats and I feel like I can't stop it and go on with Artifacts.

I had a time where I was running some Domain's after hitting AR45 but most of my gear comes from bosses while farming mats.

I only upgrade the talents that are needed to safe some time/ressources but I'm in the infinite loop of upgrading/mora issues. I still have some talents left, 3-4 weapons and 2 characters that I want to get from scratch to 70 for support purposes.

I know we can play at our own pace since its PvE but my brain wants to progress further then the game limits are allowing to.

I'm not even complaining with this and Artifacts gonna be a pain anyway with the droprate but how do I get myself to stop my itch to get them all to their Artifact-less limits?

Genshin_Impact,2021,1,"I have a feeling Ningguang will possibly be the next geo archon. This is all just my speculation and obviously not confirmed. 

1)The last archon quest continously harps on ningguang being very very ambitious. It seems like mihoyo might be telling us that Ningguangs ambitions never stop, and becoming a god may well be within her capabilities 
 
2)Ningguang being a 4 star is odd. Given her massive importance in the story, it seems odd not to make her a 5 star. Even her subordinates Ganyu and Kequing are 5 stars. 
One possible reason for this is that Mihoyo wanted to make geo more accessible for more players. Noelle was the only geo character easily available to players outside of the Traveller. If Ningguang was made a 5 star at launch, then that would have alienated geo options for a lot of players as the first geo 5 star came nearly 3 months after the game launched. While anemo also had just one 4 star(Sucrose), venti was the first banner in the game, and Jean is a permanently available 5 star.

3)This very much leaves open the possibility of a new version of Ningguang. ARCHON NINGGUANG. With a new buffed up kit which would be very very OP

4) This isn't really related buuut I have a feeling there could be something romantic between her and zhongli. In her character lore, she states that she's not interested in suitable partners because she isn't interested in something finite. Seems like Zhongli fits into that category pretty well. This also slots into the theory that Ningguang is Guizhong's reincarnation, and 
Guizhong was rumored to be Zhongli's lover during the archon war.",1609494427

Genshin_Impact,2021,1,"First off let me say I love the new area, monsters, and quests that they released.  I have had a ton of fun over the last couple weeks.  But, I am worried that once the tree is filled and the quests are done I will have zero reason to return to the mountain.  Unlike Liyue and the rest of Mondstadt there is nothing to farm material wise.  All there is is mint..... Lots and lots of mint.... New ores are the equivalent of white iron which is pretty much a waste of time.  There are zero crystals to farm and the monsters all drop the same loot you get anywhere else.  I feel like they really need to add some more farmable resources this to this area.",1609494646

Genshin_Impact,2021,1,"For characters, include both Albed'oh and Goneyu. On my end...

CHARACTERS  
1 - Goneyu (I like archers)  
2 - Jean (Because Sucrose stood me up)  
3 - Dillick ('cuz he's apparently hotter than fried chicken)  
4 - Qiqi (Does nothing for me, but at least the Acquaints would be easy)  
5 - Mona (Does nothing for me, also Oceanid please no more)  
6 (Tie) - Keqing/Albed'oh (Keqing would be a dupe, Albed'oh would mean I ""won"" the coin flip, but I'm not gonna take any more shots on his thing anyway)

WEAPONS  
1 - Skyward Harp (Tartar Sauce could use that, don't know what I'd do with the Rust though)  
2 - Wolf's Gravestone (It's apparently pretty nice just like Dillick)  
3 and under - Almost everything else.  
Second to last - Aquila Favonia (Already got one)  
Last - Any spear. (Crescent Pike, ya'know)",1609494874

Genshin_Impact,2021,1,"It isn't really hard. I have no level 90 characters or weapons but I'm not struggling. Although I do think decent artifacts will certainly help you survive even without level 90s on anything.

If you know how to play smartly (dodging, using shields, taking advantage of elemental reactions, healing, preparing food) then you'll most likely survive too even if you're only level 80.

Mobs do feel tankier, but it ain't terrible. If you want your game to always be super easy then I suggest maxing your chars as soon as you hit WR 7. In my opinion, it isn't necessary though.

Can't give comments about mobs drops, but I am certain Wolf gives better drops since he will be level 90 in WR 7.

That is all. I used to be worried about ascending but apparently it isn't hard.",1609495876

Prefacing this by saying that I have about 850ms ping on a good day- Mostly, I'm at a steady 999. I can't do anything to fix this due to where I live. Up until now, it's been somewhat frustrating, but surprisingly usable- Except, this boss fight is all but impossible.

In the time it takes for my character to respawn, the Regisvine has already regenerated ALL of its health because it has registered me as leaving the arena. This is the only boss to do this 90% of the time. 

Add onto this the absurd difficulty level when you lack a levelled Pyro character, and the Co-op bugs for this event, I've pretty much given up on completing it unless Mihoyo fixes this.

Spiral Abyss should encourage different team formations by giving buffs when the appropriate teams are used, not limit gameplay elements.

Genshin_Impact,2021,1,"The latest abyss is quite tough but the most annoying thing so far has to be the Cicin mages.

If you're fighting them near the door (the path that you comes in or the one on the other side), there's a chance that when they blink, they'll blink to the other side of the barrier, causing you to be unable to attack her. She might blink back in eventually but you're pretty much at the mercy of her. Pick some other corner/wall to wallbang her.

Also, her cicin can actually go through those barriers and you won't be able to attack them. It is something that you might want to consider if her shields are up because that's how she constantly replenish her shield, from the cicins.

\[Similar thing happened before with Electro Cicin in the previous version of Floor 11 but they get stuck on top of those pillars around the arena rather than behind the barrier\]

Genshin_Impact,2021,1,Thou shalt not enter Geo Traveler...,1609500941
Genshin_Impact,2021,1,"After 60 wishes i've had ""ok"" luck i didn't get one where i only got a 4 star weapon, each one gave me a character, but non gave me a ""2 for one"" (or 3 for 1 like the previous two banners did) So my ""end"" total is 2 Fischl (now C4) 1 Bennett (wonderlust gave me my first when 1.2 dropped) and 3 Sucrose

So i have Bennett at the minimum he needs so his Ult has no HP  requirements (aka heals and buffs) so great thats what i wanted and Sucrose i got lucky and scored her second Constellation which gives her Ult a longer time active. Fischl, now has her Ult deal more damage and heal which is fantastic

I now have nearly all the 4 stars (missing Beidou) And since i'm not doing anymore wishing and i'm saving for Xiao since i got lucky and DIDN'T get a 5 star on this banner i'm ""only"" 30 wishes away from the next Guaranteed 5 star...saving that for Xiao

So, Since i wanted Sucrose for CC She will definitely be a focus point- but how far to go? 60 makes logical sense but is she someone who benefits from higher levels as a ""support"" more than others due to her Swirl and Elemental mastery boosts? the other issues is replacement and teamwork (aka elemental resonance)

Then theres Bennett, at C1 he'll be healing AND buffing my team, and with his buff getting boosted the higher the talent climbs, If i'm using a strong physical damage dealer (Razor) then gettng buffed and healed is a massive positive no? Couple that with a second Pyro, Like Xinyan, and i'll have heal-shield and damage boost AND the Elemental resonance +25% attack, But i don't see a place for Sucrose in this party?

Before i go and blast these two to level 60+ i'd like to know WHAT and WHERE they excel at and which party members they work well with, Since i've been running a Fischl-Razor-Diona-Xiangling party for nearly 90% of the game, changing my party and combat tactics could take some getting used to, and THEN theres talent books-Writs-Artifacts and level -Resources and of course Mora

for reference my characters levels look like this

Genshin_Impact,2021,1,"Pyro is fucking broken in this game, Pyro is literally miHoYo's golden child

Oh you want to kill those annoying dendro slime? 
To bad, you need Pyro

Oh you want to light up the torches to solve puzzles and eliminate sheer cold? 
To bad, you need Pyro

Oh you want to break the shield from the most annoying element in this game? 
To bad, you need Pyro

Pyro literally can kill all enemies except Pyro slimes

Pyro &gt; Hydro slime = Vaporize increased dmg
Pyro &gt; Cryo slime = Melt increased dmg
Pyro &gt; Electro slime = Overloaded, Pyro dmg
Pyro &gt; Dendro slime = Burning, Pyro dmg

And that's not the worst part, did you know that Pyro slime's flame would off if you make a vaporize or melt reaction against it? That means you can only do 2 Vaporize and melts FOR A PYRO SLIME, AND GUESS WHAT? EVEN CRYO SLIMES WHEN WE MAKE MELT REACTION AGAINST IT DOESN'T GO OFF, AND THAT MEANS 2X MULTIPLIER DMG EVERY TIME A PYRO CHARACTER HITS IT, what a joke

And to put insult on an injury, Electro doesn't even do shit if it's not a hydro slime

To put Electro in a worse situation, 
you want to pop those Hydro mage shield? 
You better bring Cryo

you want to destroy the Hydro fatui's shield? 
You better bring Electro

And that just shows how incredibly and ridiculous Pyro is right know

Every reaction that involves Pyro literally favors or put Pyro in some kind of advantage, and we're NOT even talking about the resonance

If that doesn't convince you that Pyro is broken, I don't know what is

Edit: Geo shields can be broken by 5 things :
Claymore, Geo skill, Plunge attack, Explosive, Overloaded (which of course also needs Pyro to work)

That means Pyro literally can break many more shields (ehem... Dendro shield hilichurl...ehem) than the other elementsl",1609501816

Genshin_Impact,2021,1,You can now see all your stats on the official website,1609503429
Genshin_Impact,2021,1,"I did some tests with lvl90 Fischl with lvl1 1\* bow and no artifacts against lvl80 water slimes.

ATK 268 + 64 = 332

|Talent|ATK%|Expected DMG (pre-resistance)|Actual DMG|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Normal Attack 1st hit (lvl8)|75.4%|250|**117**|
|Oz hit (lvl9)|151%|501|**235**|
|Oz C1|22%|73|**34**|
|Oz C6|30%|99|**46**|

As you can see while relative DMG values between different talents are correct, they are nowhere near the expected absolute values. E.g. Normal Attack should hit for 332 \* 75.4% = 250, but it hits for 117 instead, or like 55% less than expected. Afaik slimes have only 10% resistance on them, so this can't be it.

Genshin_Impact,2021,1,"As an Albedo user, currently I'm confused with which one to choose on its timepiece.

Personally, I'm using a DEF build right now with 6-7k crit per blossom.

But, lately I've been wondering with how I'm playing Albedo, since beside using his transient blossom(E), I'm using his Q quite often as well. And the change from Def to Atk timepiece hurts between his blossom and his burst. I use his burst quite often and fast since I'm pairing him with zhongli.

At which point Def build out DPS Atk build with his burst?

I mean, I use his burst quite often (and I think many of us as well), but will the damage increase from DEF build blossom outpace the damage difference on using his ult? At which point? I'm only talking for C0 and C1, cince C2 will increase burst damage from def as well.

I'm not that good at math, and I haven't found one that calculates this as well after looking at streamers etc. Usually they already made a choice of DEF or ATK build and shows the damage difference on--hit, but haven't found any that calculates the total potential damage.

Liyue(Geo): obviously has Chinese influences, so I put it there.

Inazuma(Electro): obviously has Japanese influences, so please let it be there.

Monstadt(Anemo): on the original Genshin Impact map, Monstadt was northeast of Liyue, so I plot that down as well on the real-world map.

Sumeru(Dendro): the word Sumeru sounds like the Thai for ""สุเมรุ"", which is a mountain that houses the gods.

Natlan(Pyro): I don't know why I put it in India, probably because of Diwali, the festival of lights(fire reference)?

Fontaine(Hydro): Iraq was once called Mesopotamia, which means ""land between the rivers"". This was a reference to the Tigris and the Euphrates, which both flow across the country to the Arabian Sea. I declare this as a Hydro(water) reference, and so put in Iraq.

Khaenri'ah(Unknown): Israel was once part of Canaan, the land that was mentioned in the Bible during the times of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. They both sounded alike, so yeah, I put it there.

Snezhnaya(Cryo): Siberia was the coldest region of Russia, and Snezhnaya was the land of Cryo, so I may put it there.

If my theory was correct, then Dragonspine is probably on Mount Paektu in North Korea or somewhere.

My team rn is mainly Kokomi, Raiden, Yoimiya, and then Ayaka as my main, anyone can be replaced aside from Ayaka (Kokomi is getting replaced by Mona once I build her). I want to know who one, you guys think is the hottest (this is important I mainly go by waifu meta no penis policy), and two would be best for a team that currently has Ayaka and Mona.

Genshin_Impact,2022,1,"So I was talking with my friends about Yae coming in 2.5, and some kept theorizing that Raiden might have a rerun as well. And with Zhongli coming up in 2.4, I realized something.

&amp;#x200B;

In 1.1, Zhongli was available as a playable character and had his first banner. Later, he had a rerun in 1.5, along with the introduction of Azdaha, who was not only the second Liyue weekly boss, but was also tied to his 2nd character quest

In 2.1, Raiden Shogun had her banner. Both Archons had their first banner in version x.1, if Mihoyo plans to follow this pattern,  Raiden's rerun, 2nd character quest, as well as the second weekly boss for Inazuma will be in 2.5.

&amp;#x200B;

BUT WAIT, THERE'S MORE.

Zhongli is coming back in 2.4 right? Recall who had their rerun in Version 1.4, Venti.

The archon of the previous region during the current story of that time, had their reruns in Version x.4.

&amp;#x200B;

So if my theory is right, starting with Version 2.5, we will have:

2.5, Raiden Shogun Rerun/Quest 2 + weekly boss &gt; 3.1, Sumeru's Archon's first banner &gt; 3.4 Raiden Shogun 2nd Rerun &gt; 3.5 Sumeru's Archon's rerun/Quest 2 + weekly boss

Genshin_Impact,2022,1,"As of now, a lot of endgame players are shredding though weekly bosses like it's nothing (especially Dvalin and Childe). A suggestion I have to keep these bosses deserving of the ""Weekly Boss"" title and to bring back the fun and interesting moments in these bosses is to add an extra difficulty (which I call ""Challenge Mode"") where the difficulty scales off your party strength (any better ways to scale the difficulty is appreciated). With this we can now see Dvalin rains us with meteors or die to Childe's counters/plunge attacks once again. Of course, with such a higher difficulty comes with better rewards.

I understand she doesn’t rly CC, but she heals pretty well + dish out some damage with her burst at the same time + cool skill as well.

So have been wondering why? 🧐 
Or if you’re a sayu main, why do u choose her over other characters for the team slot? :)

Edit: Thank you all for the replies! Didn’t expect to many :O 
Seems like she’s a character that despite having much utility, doesn’t excel in any role (cc, healing, buff, energy etc) enough to be chosen over other characters. Tho having her c6 makes a difference.
Still, she’s a fun character to use esp in the open world! Also super cool to see how some of y’all use her in the abyss.",1641015520

For quite a while we didn't have enough characters to expand this rotation (in reasonable way). Even when we finally got to 18 4-star characters in total, it's understandable that Mihoyo didn't want to instantly give (basically free) access to new shiny toys to the playerbase for a while. 

However, now we have pool of 6 4-star characters that feel ""old enough"" to be put into regular rotation. Sucrose and Chongyun are release characters. Diona and Xinyan are with us for so long I keep forgetting that they weren't in game at some point. Rosaria and Yanfei have certain ""newness"" to them, but they were both released almost 9 months ago. I feel like all of them could by added to the rotation and it wouldn't really change anything.

Perhaps it's a little too soon as with Yun Jin release we will be at ""at 5 in another 6 set"" and only after release of next 4-star after Yun Jin, Mihoyo will be willing to consider expanding the shop ( in order to keep certain ""distance"" between shop pool and banner-only units).",1641028814

Genshin_Impact,2022,1,Funny accidental illegal signature that tripped the system,1641032542
Genshin_Impact,2022,1,"Background: Since this game came out and I started playing a just after the Venti banner went away and the primo gems prices went up, I have NEVER gotten a 5 star that wasn't from pity. Due to this being a fact of my life and me having a problem, I cannot save more than 600 Primo Gems without spending it, so whenever I reach near that point I always wish. I jeep wishing up to about 70 wishes, then try to hit pity to get my 5 star. This method was tried and true and the videos I have seen of people getting multiple 5 stars from 10 pulls of even individual ones back to back was just  part of another world.

So this week, before I found out Ganyu was getting a re-run I made wishes to get Itto since I was already at 70 wishes and had just got to Inazuma. I get him then tried to use up the rest of my wishes to build up to 70 so I can be ready for Ganyu. But then the unthinkable happens, in a 10 pull (Christmas gift to myself was buying primo gems) I saw gold and was speechless for a second because it had only been 20 wishes. Yay I got Qi Qi, but was now pissed as 20 wishes were wasted on my way to 70, which meant I have to start over. A few minutes ago I bought primo gems after the shop reset and bought 5 more..... I got myself a second Itto, 

at this point I think my game is broken and I cannot cope with this as I really want to continue with my bad luck and keep the 70 wish build up going.

Just sharing my shock at something I thought was very improbable. Has this happened to you guys?",1641032560

Genshin_Impact,2022,1,"The blessing we have now is the biggest buff I've ever seen in a while. You can get up to 100% elemental damage bonus for one element, which makes this rotation a cakewalk. 

I did it with a Lv 80 Noelle on one side and had almost 30 seconds left at the end of 12-3...and my other side wasn't particular strong. I just tried Xiao, Bennett, Mona and Raiden for fun. Didn't know it would actually work out..., but damn, was it easy with that blessing.

On the other hand I noticed that the stronger the blessing the weaker the newest character and with that I don't mean Itto, but Shenhe. I kind of get the feeling that mihoyo tries to compensate her weakness with this insane blessing, because she is best suited in a mono cryo team. I don't even want to imagine how hard Ayaka and Ganyu will hit with that blessing,...even without Shenhe.

Genshin_Impact,2022,1,"The artifact grind in Genshin is probably the worse thing about the game. This is my thought and seems to be similar for a bulk of the community. 

With minimal changes to how we obtain artifacts since the game released, do you think the system will ever be changed in a way that actually benefits the player base? 

Mihoyo is obviously aware of how the community feels about artifacts so what would it take to see any sort of change from them. Curious what everyone thinks.",1641042681

Genshin_Impact,2022,1,"It can be because of their character design (which I don't think will be the case because Mihoyo has a habit of closely tying character design with their element), their character's personality or their playstyle.

For me, when I first encountered Gorou in the Archon quest, for some reason I thought he had a Hydro vision? Which doesn't make sense at all because Geo does somehow fit his playstyle. But I thought when he was released that he would be a Hydro character. 

I thought Sayu would be a Dendro character which is dumb of me to think she would be the first character of an unreleased element instead of a character that's memorable like... y'know, the Dendro Archon. I was also surprised that she's a greatsword wielding considering all of them are bigger (and heavier) than her.",1641047421

Genshin_Impact,2022,1," 

When might be Itto's rerun ?

So a little back story....I really wanted 2 characters from the whole 5 stars roster in the game. Either Itto or Keqing. My friends recommended me to wish on the standard banner and try my luck for Keqing there and sadly I got a 5stars weapon (Aquila Favonia) so they told me np since I got a weapon my chances of getting a character would be higher, welp I went again and got Aquila Favonia again.... Now traumatized I decided I would never wish on the standard banner again ever. I was told if I would wish on Itto and lose the 50 50 I have a chance of getting Keqing and if I win I would get Itto so it is a win win situation...but nope I got Mona and really I wanna delete the game at this point...

Edit: -Fine guys I won’t talk to these friends anymore 😂😂

Genshin_Impact,2022,1,"Most of the open world feels barren after playing a while and finishing quests. Exploring doesn’t really carry any weight since there isn’t any big dangers out to get you. All the mobs of monsters are just HP sponges that can’t leave their assigned posts. Suspicious arena-like areas can easily be avoided if you don’t feel like dealing with the bigger HP sponges. Just imagine what it would be like if enemies can wander further out of their invisible boxes, and had less bulk but more aggro. Like what you would normally expect dangerous creatures to be like. Weather/climate and pretty much just the environment in general rarely feels dangerous outside of dragonspine’s cold. Getting hit by a lightning bolt only deals only a tick of damage lol. Wind apparently doesn’t exist since you can’t encounter waves in the ocean or get blown away when gliding. Even when we go to dark dungeons or abandoned ruins, it never feels like we shouldn’t be there. The terrains just welcome the player in and puts its rewards on a pedestal for traveler to pick up and waltz out. 

I know the game has its limitations and that making exploration more challenging may sound a little annoying on paper, but I still think the open world would be a whole lot more fun if it felt a little more organic.",1641056738

Genshin_Impact,2022,1,"I'm pretty sure lots and lots of you have seen some madlads building shit characters like Amber, Lisa, Barbara, so they deal tons of damage even though they aren't supposed to be dealing lots of dmg at all. Such videos made me think about tier lists and why they are like this. F.e. I can build Amber to deal 45k melt damage by a charged shot. I'm pretty sure Hu Tao with the same artifacts, assuming she will have pretty much same DMG weapon, will deal like 70 k dmg, or just a lot higher DPS. So what I want to say is a DPS character's tier highly depends on amount of investment it requires to be good, you can make an OP DPS out of anything but you will need a lot more investment.

P.S I didn't do any calculations, but I'm sure my whole idea is correct, thanks for reading!
Edit: Sorry lads, Sucrose can deal lots of dmg, but not the amount I've seen in some videos. Also, what I wanted to say is some DPS characters have higher max potential than lower tier ones.",1641059743

Gorou, now it would probably be more logical for him to be 24-25 like Kokomi, but he can also be 17-19 owing to appearance or maybe even 16-15

but honestly how old is kazuha. for appearance sake we could call him 22-23 but his entire personality , life plot, and everything kinda wants me to put it on 29-35 idk why. early 30s or late 20s.

Genshin_Impact,2022,1,"Edit #1: Thanks for [**IsBirdWatching**](https://www.reddit.com/user/IsBirdWatching/) and [**TmanGBx**](https://www.reddit.com/user/TmanGBx/) for clearing my 1st and 2nd question!\\

Edit #2: Adding wording on the 3rd question

Okay, so I know the theme is about the oath and pride between Crimson and Blue Oni. I feel like Mihoyo did a great job with the antagonist in the quest by making him more human (or Oni?) instead of generic cartoon villain in the other story quest. **But the problem is that I got that positive impression after I replayed the quest with all the information from the ending.**

**While playing the quest, I felt... lost**. I feel like I was just being dragged along and there are some missing context in the dialogue that I should know, while all the characters in the story already know. That some characters know something that's going to happen without enough information.

Please see these following questions not with the knowledge we have after finishing the quest, but with the knowledge that we have during the quest.

Here's my question:

1. **Why did Itto feel like he HAD TO take all the blame from Takuya?** I understand that Itto tries to cover for Takuya by claiming he is the one that did the crimes, and he was trying to help Takuya, but how is he planning to help him? **And why is that he feels he had to help Takuya before he was captured by the Tenryou Commission?** He keeps saying that ""he can't let Tenryou Commision get to arrest Takuya"" but never explained it. For now, I think my answer is that he's just an idiot and following the authorities isn't in line with his character. All of this problem could be easily solved if Itto work along or talk to people to help him.  *Answer: Itto believed that he owed the Blue Oni for all their sacrifice and he should help family in need.*
2. **Why does the Traveler had to follow Itto?** At the beach, **why don't we just side with the Tenryou Commission** to capture Itto, defeat the Kairagi, capture Takuya, and talk it out after? From the previous point, I could understand why Itto did what he did, but I couldn't understand the Traveler. *Answer: Story Purpose, otherwise the plot won't work. I can accept that.*
3. **How does Itto seem to know what Takuya's going to do next from the conversation at the beach?** He seem to know that Takuya is going to do something bad ""before it's too late""**.** So Takuya did do all those crimes to feed his people, and later we know he wants to commit sudoku to punish himself. I assume he got enough food to last his people quite a while. But how did Itto knows that? How did Itto plan on talking him out of it?

**I feel like the quest didn't give us a concrete narrative objective.** I believe the correct term is ""Signposting"". It feels like we're being dragged along for the ride with Itto without fully understanding what Itto is going to do next, but it feels like we should know. This is totally different from Beidou's Hangout Event where Beidou is using passwords to navigate dark market, and Thoma's Hangout Event where Thoma makes that merchant begs for his forgiveness. In those two instances, we had an idea what they are going to do, but we didn't know how. When it was all finally revealed, I feel very impressed instead of confused.

The quest did establish the characters well on what they would and wouldn't do, but **the story didn't give enough information on how the character thinks**, until the end of the story. Mostly on the reasoning behind Itto's actions. I remember yelling to my screen ""Why don't they just ask for help or talk it out!"", when it was near the very end, explained that Oni has a certain pride. This disconnect between myself and the character costs me immersion in the story, and I ended up frustrated. 

And I feel like **there is too much discussion between Itto and Takuya about the Oni's ideals** to the point that it muddles the overall plot. I think the worst part is the conversation at the beach. Instead of focusing on or hinting at what Takuya is going to do next and how to help him, we're dragged into discussing failures from the two Oni and what they think.

But this is just my opinion. From a quick reddit search, I see that a lot of people truly love the quest, some even said it was the best story quest so far.  I accept any feedback, explanation, and criticism about this. **Help me understand and appreciate the quest better!**",1641064137

Above are two useful tables to help you determine how many pulls you should save. Examples on how to use the tables:

* Q: How many pulls should you save to have a 50% chance to get the featured 5\*? A: Refer to the first table. The third column with the row corresponding to 50% gives 80 pulls.
* Q: How many pulls should you save to have a 90% chance to R5 a weapon with Epitomized Path? A: Refer to the second table. The last column with the row corresponding to 90% gives 698 pulls.
* Q: How many pulls should you save to have a 75% chance to get C6+R1? A: Unfortunately, simply adding the above tables won't give you the right number, but you may refer to the link below for more tables suited to your needs. (The last image in the link gives 848)

[Link to 4\* tables](https://imgur.com/a/epKKGrt)

# How these tables were generated:

# (WARNING: Some Math ahead)

The statistical model was based off [this post](https://www.hoyolab.com/article/497840). In summary, the probability mass function *f* and cumulative mass function *F* for pulling any 5\* character can be expressed as follows:

&amp;#x200B;

[PMF and CMF for 5\* characters](https://preview.redd.it/o0dhop8sv5981.png?width=1287&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=14e3f59d5a0a19b112fea26a412aae42a4cc2e81)

Where p = 0.006 and d = 0.06, the base probability to pull any 5\* character and the linear increase in probability, respectively. Similar functions were established for the weapon banner, except p = 0.007, d = 0.07, pity starts at 63, and the guarantee is at 77. I am aware that this guaranteed number deviates from the official number of 80, but it's best to use the model that better represents the data (see this [quote by Feynman](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/625767-it-doesn-t-matter-how-beautiful-your-theory-is-it-doesn-t)).

It is to be noted that the second item in the piece-wise function *F* can be expressed as a sum of terms of a recurrence relation of *f* to be more efficiently implemented in a programming language (there is a closed-form, but why). MATLAB was used to implement a Monte-Carlo simulation with 10 million trials, incorporating the rules of the 50/50 and Epitomized Path. A trial is concluded when the number of pulls needed to obtain the desired amount of constellations and/or refinements is determined, as opposed to a trial being a singular pull. The inverse cumulative distribution function and `rand()` was used to simulate pulling any 5\*. The values of *F* were tabulated such that each index corresponds to the number of pulls so as to utilize indexing.

EDIT: I added some tables for 4\* characters and weapons (see above). It doesn't take into account 5\* interference, but a guaranteed 4\* at the 11th or 12th pull are rare events anyway, so it shouldn't affect the numbers appreciably, if at all. These tables used p = 0.051, d = 0.51, and soft pity at 9 for 4\* characters; p = 0.06, d = 0.6, and soft pity at 8 for 4\* weapons. There is no guarantee you'll get the 4\* you want but there is a ""practical guarantee"" listed at 99%.

Some caveats: The model also doesn't take into account additional available pulls by starglitter and these numbers are assuming that you have a zeroed wish counter. The model was also based off data obtained prior to when Epitomized Path was implemented.",1641065073

Genshin_Impact,2022,1,"Hey, I was looking over Yunjin's kit on HoneyHunter and her damage buff from her ult seems pretty insane. The biggest question right now is if her ult's damage bonus works the same way as Shenhe's, which adds additional base damage that gets amplified by damage bonuses and crit bonuses, or is just a flat damage bonus. The former seems more likely, as both Shenhe and Yunjin are released at the same time and the wordings of the skills are very similar, but I'll consider both cases.

&amp;#x200B;

Yunjin is assumed to be built full defense with 4 set husk. With Gorou's buffs, she can probably reach around 2500 defense at lv 80. 2500 defense at talent 8 plus her a2 in a full geo team (53.96% of def) provides and extra 1350 base damage.

For simplicity sake, I'll use my 4 glad c6 noelle, which has 1826 def. With gorou buffs, her ult converts to 4196 atk. 4196 atk multiplied by the average of her first 3 normal attacks at tl 9 (146%) is 6126 base damage. This translates to roughly 18000 average damage against normal mobs with my noelle

an added 1350 base damage to 6126 increases my noelle's damage by an astounding 22%! 

If we assume the 1350 is flat damage added, she will still roughly buff my noelle damage by 1350/18000 = 7.5%

&amp;#x200B;

In addition, Yunjin is looking like a good battery. From the version preview, her e generated 2 particles on tap and 3 on perfect counter, which is the same as beidou. With her on fav lance and gorou on exile and fav bow, noelle can probably run 0 er now. Oh and also, Yunjin also buffs 15% normal attack damage and 12% normal attack speed at C2 and C6, respectively. 

&amp;#x200B;

This actually makes me question the design decision they made with Shenhe with just 5/7 stacks. Compared with Yunjin's 30 stacks, which Noelle can still comfortably use up when facing against multiple enemies, 5/7 stacks just seems way too restrictive. Yunjin is more niche however, but when slotted into a team that can use her buff, she just seems a lot more useful than Shenhe. What are your thoughts?",1641071586

So im wondering what are peoples standards on artifacts and am I too lenient with my artifacts or are people too strict ( for reference I've played every day since launch so its not a matter of me not farming enough)

I personally raise artifacts if they

Have 2 crit stats or have a combination i need (e.g ocean hued with hp% and er%) 
If they are a 3 stat artifact with 1 crit stat ill go to plus 4 to see if I can get the second one 
If the artifact has a mainstat I don't need ill raise it if its cracked (double crit + another stat i want)

I'll keep artifacts if they
Feather/flower have over 35 crit value 
Goblet/timepiece over 25 critbvalue
Circlet over 15 crit value
If an artifact has over 4 rolls of a specific stat + another stat i want (e.g 4 rolls into atk + er)


I stop farming for characters specifically once they're at 120 crit value  (60/120 before weapons/ ascension stats) however i pass down artifacts from my most used characters downwards (so even if I was farming for let's say beidou in emblem domain my raiden would still get priority for those pieces if they're an upgrade)",1641072267

Genshin_Impact,2022,1,"I'm genuinely curious if I'm the only person on console who has this problem or it happens so often people have just stopped talking about it but the shortcut wheel just straight doesn't work. I've made this post just to see if other people have this issue because I haven't seen it discussed at all. 

Basically the shortcut wheel has two major issues, the less problematic is that when you highlight one section of the wheel and let go to go into it, there's a pretty large chance it'll just straight up take you into another section that definitely wasn't what you were aiming for (multiple times were I tried to enter my inventory only to pull up characters instead over and over). 

The more glaring issue though and the one that I think I'm the only one suffering from because no one else mentions it is that sometimes it just doesn't work at all. You'll try to enter one section, it makes the noise confirming it and nothing happens. Sometimes it's really nice and other times it fails so many times in a row that it would've been faster to simply have paused and chosen. What makes this worse is that you're forced to use it in domains, making scenarios where it fails over and over common. 

I've tried to see if there's a button you're supposed to press or if you have to be staying still when using it but neither are consistent so that proves that wrong? Is there something I'm missing or am I the only one dealing with this?",1641075322

I would add a whip that has longer range similar to a longer weaker claymore for the first hits then an extra long hit for the final attack. The damage would be like a sword swinging at a moderately fast speed. The charged attack would be a charged swings overhead after a few seconds it would infuse the whip with their element to to a long swing in front across a 70 degree ish angle. It would make it better at application compared to a bow but less range more wide damage.

Genshin_Impact,2022,1,"Anyone have an idea what Hydro is supposed to be?I know there archon will likely be the strongest healer in the game if precedence  still holds that elemental resonance highlights the Archons pinnacle strength. 

I don’t have enough data points of new Hydro units to really get a feel of how the element is supposed to be distinctive. I get it for Pyro and cryo- a lot of damage which is what makes their elements supreme. Electro is really cementing itself to be about energy and powerful bursts which makes it my favorite element. And anemo is crowd control grouping and movement. 

And now with finally getting two new Geo units and a third on the way it’s starting to be clear they are built to be sturdy. Whether it’s through high defense scaling or HP… Their units are to last the longest. Also shields.

I know Hydro is the best at applying their element off field and arguably has the best reaction in that all three can be pretty cool. But other than ceiling what else is gonna make them feel distinctive? I’m sure Ayato and hopefully one of the new Inazuma four stars is Hydro so that we have more data points to see how Hydro units are to feel different. 

And I’m sure we are all eager to see how Dendro was created to feel different. Especially in the wake of Pyro and cryo-supremacy

But I really can’t place Hydro with the four characters we’ve had all year and Kokomi coming in to highlight healing dominance. Surely they must be more than just Hydro application right?",1641079801

Genshin_Impact,2022,1,"I was putting this off for a long time so pardon being late to the party, but it was mostly because people kept hating on it and I didn't want to be disappointed. At some point I decided to give it a go for primo reasons but I ended up actually liking it. Of course, it's not one of my favorite story quests, but I certainly enjoyed it more than people put it out to be.

Here are 3 reasons why I liked it:

**1) Addressing War Veterans**

While most of the civilians are happy that everything is peaceful again, some of the former soldiers have become alienated because now they feel like everything they've done so far and all the lives sacrificed so far have been meaningless. Now although in modern times, ""we fight for peace"", in Sangonomiya's context, they were really fighting to overthrow the Shogunate (as a Resistance). So we must understand that the end of the war was not a military success for the troops, and may have even be seen as a failure to the more radical groups.

The conversation with Kouzen is especially illuminating and really captures the heart of the matter. I really liked how they portrayed a battle hardened veteran who has completely lost his way now that his motivations are taken away and his skill sets rendered kind of useless. While drunk, he continues to thrust his spear into thin air. 

This is pretty akin to real life veterans, who find it difficult to assimilate back into civilian life after pretty much training for a good chunk of their younger years in the art of killing people and also PTSD losing many friends during the war. Many of them still face homelessness and unemployment today and it's honestly sad given how much they've sacrificed. 

These people needed help, and Kokomi had completely overlooked this. Her eventual solution is to start a new special forces unit, which I think was a nice way to balance their skillsets with a need for some military deterrence in an uncertain era of peace. 

**2) Competent Leadership**

There are a lot of people who accuse Kokomi of being an incompetent leader. In fact, part of the story quest is trying to show how she doesn't think she is very competent either.

Many people didn't like how she was being soft to the belligerents among her soldiers who essentially wanted to restart the civil war. First, she did mention that if they ever stepped out of line again, they would no longer have leniency and will instead be punished accordingly. Next, the only reason she allows them to go without punishment is because she blames herself partly for not considering this outcome and also for not taking care of her troops.

Taking responsibility for the actions of your subordinates, regardless of who is truly at fault, is something a good leader does. And I think although Kokomi doesn't give herself much credit for being a leader, she actually exemplifies a lot of leadership qualities in how she acts towards her troops and the civilians as well. In the village segment she shows both compassion and austerity, resolving disputes with a level head, never taking sides.

My favorite line during this segment is that Kokomi states ""we deal in facts, not opinions"", which is a big social commentary on how the current political discourse is full of hoaxes, rumors and conspiracy theories rather than scientific evidence-based decision making (that we really need). If you also take into account her professional mannerisms during the peace negotiations, I felt that Kokomi actually makes for a much better leader than she herself would admit.

**3) Introversion and Work**

I also personally resonated a lot with Kokomi's character as an introvert. Outside, she's seen as a leader who has to handle disputes, review requests and make these speeches to people, but on the inside, all of these things that require social interaction tire her out. 

I found her personal diary very amusing with her assigning negative energy points to things like ""lot's of people spoke to me again -3 energy"" and ""spending time arguing with merchants -4 energy"". It's meant to be a joke, but it's actually so true for an introvert who needs time to themselves to rest and recharge.

Some people complain that Kokomi is ""just another workaholic"" like literally everyone else, but I don't think so. In fact, she says the people's requests can get annoying at times, and even wishes that all her work would just ""do itself"" without having to lift a finger. The fact that she knows when it's time to take a rest in her book cave is probably testament that she actually doesn't like her job very much, but goes along with it for the sake of her people.

The reason why she has the similar ""tired"" trope is not because she works a lot, but because her job doesn't fit her personality. And that is exactly the kind of disconnect that the story quest was trying to portray with all the talk about ""energy"". Think about it - If you were working a job you didn't like, wouldn't you also feel just as tired with it?

Altogether I wouldn't say that the story quest was the best, it definitely has some flaws that others have already pointed out, but I wanted to share some of my positive thoughts about the story.

Assumptions:

Power levels are roughly the same as at the end of the Inazuma archon quest.  
Power levels are judged based on lore. This means in-story feats or abilities.  
No one has any reason to hold back. No one goes easy on Klee because she's a kid, Zhongli doesn't go easy on his adepti, etc.  
The matches are held in a ring. Ganyu can't snipe anyone before they get within a kilometre of her.  
Matches are held in this order. Combatants may gain an advantage by watching their opponents and/or losing to them. Most relevant for Tartaglia, as one of his strengths is his ability to adapt.  
These matches are held when everyone is in peak shape. Tartaglia gets to use his Foul Legacy in an unlimited number of matches.

If you want to see the result of individual matches, go to the top of the page and click either ""Group Stage"" or ""Final Stage.""

Genshin_Impact,2022,1,"Hi everyone! As you all may know, the current Battle Pass is ending real soon and I really don't know what decision to make.

First off, I'd love to have the Battle Pass Weapon: Serpent Spine, which goes perfectly for my Main DPS Diluc. The thing is though that I don't really have a good shield yet (only have unbuilt Noelle) and based on my playstyle, I keep getting hit by the flaming grass because of the Pyro of Diluc. I'm currently just using the Prototype Archaic. 

Secondly, the Fates I'd get would be reaaally helpful for me since I'm saving my wishes for 2.4's Ganyu and Zhongli. I currently have 60 wishes worth of primogems saved up and the 3 Fates from the BP would definitely help but if I purchase the Battle Pass at Level 30, I'd be missing on the remaining Primogems and Fate.

Now, the thing about all of these is that my schedule IRL is gonna be very tight starting next week. At frist, I was planning to get 2.4's Battle Pass instead and get that Level 50 but I'm not sure if it's achieveable considering I'll be very busy soon. Any recommendations?",1641087624

Genshin_Impact,2022,1,"As a player coming up on their 4th month with Genshin, I've finally hit that AR45 grind, and one thing I've noticed from lurking places like this sub is an understandable issue with all the old 'WL promotion is a trap' YT bait.

BUT!

It's weird because I'm a newer player, along with several of my friends, and while the difficulty isn't going up, I'm noticing that there's a rock and a hard place regarding standard DPS for team builds that are less-than-optimized, and WL6 having enemies slightly above my level while I admittedly had early game resources spread too thin for a freemium player means combat encounters can run longer than they probably need to. And this is probably happening to a *lot* of players, given how big the game is and how comparatively small online Genshin forums are (Genshin has a *lot* of active accounts, and a *lot* of them probably aren't as concerned with optimal builds as they are with just getting daily grind out of the way before work).

So I've gotta say, I don't always think 'don't be afraid to increase world level' is always the best blanket advice: obviously I've gotta go with 'do what feels right'; but more importantly, if you're a newer player like me and running into a brick wall (admittedly my team is literally 3 archers and a catalyst and 2 of those archers are Aloy and Yoimiya, and Aloy is sitting on her Predator Bow, so not ideal), I've gotta say for anyone who might not be having the same experience as others:

*Don't be afraid to increase WL, but I've seen from my brother that once you reach WL6 you're literally almost dealing with full endgame stuff: the level growth on WL7 and 8 enemies vs. WL6 is a MUCH smaller gap than the climb up to WL6 was. WL6 is a cinch for \*anybody\* once they've got some 90s and some good gear and artifacts under their belt, but that first big grind from AR45 to 50 has got a LOT of built-in tedium, and if you're not a DPS machine even at 50 and you're not mechanically accustomed to all the enemies and bosses, don't be afraid to hang out at 5-6 for a little while. I've seen firsthand, those final ascension grinds are still pretty considerable even when you're hedging WL8.*

*I think the most important goal for a casual F2P or freemium player trying to catch up on content is just being able to get to AR50 to cap characters and do 90 domains more comfortably, NOT \*necessarily\* reach higher WLs. And if you want to hang out at WL5 or 6 to avoid tedium until you can build your team optimally, I'd highly recommend taking all the time you need: it's not about the game already being easy enough at WL7 and 8 in my mind, it's about WL increases simultaneously increasing enemy health pools, and about how you may not have the DPS necessary to melt through that as quickly as some players to mitigate the tedium of prolonged mob encounters. Given that the early game is full of several forced promotions to punish overgrinding, I think that if a player's comfortable at WL5-6, it can absolutely be an okay sweet spot for the average casual to hang out until they mechanically master all of the bosses and build the kind of DPS that can melt through mobs. It lets you cross that final ascension finish line while simultaneously letting even suboptimal 4 star players work out their kinks - endgame promotions don't have to be a race.*",1641089060

BUT for some reason there is a obsession on hating real hard not just the caracter, but the fanbase too, like misportray how the actual fanbase reacts or is doing. the hate reached a peak during in 2.1 too were trolls and annoying people just joined the subreddit and discord makes a rude comment and leave, hell even now i still reading nonsensical comments about them and putting words that they never said, and plus if someone comments ""i like signora"" or something realted to her they go full ""copium"" ""keep dreaming"" ""share me the thing you're smoking kid"" \*insert ashes joke\* \*not even ashes will remain\*

Genshin_Impact,2022,1,"I don't know if anyone finds this topic interesting but i thought maybe my experience of saving would be useful for other f2p players, and i also feel like I've kind of graduated so i wanted to reflect on this journey. You can skip to the SUMMARY for the results of the saving period if you don't wanna read all the drama.

I started playing during Albedo's first banner. I couldn't reach pity for Albedo and after him was Ganyu. I wasn't really into the Xiao hype back then, my teams lacked Cryo characters and Amber was my only bow user. So i REALLY wanted Ganyu (plus, no other character's design has made me feel what i felt for this woman). However, Mona ruined my pity :')...and my Villian origin story began. 

I loved Xiao after his test run, so i used my guaranteed on him. I got Xiao 3-5 hours before the end of his banner, thanks to those free fates they gave us for lantern rite. Thus, i was left with 0 primogems. I stopped wasting primos on the Standard banner after doing a couple of 10 pulls cuz i was close to pity, and started to save for Zhongli.

On the first day of Zhongli's banner, combined with my built pity and everything, i had around 100-120 wishes (don't know the exact number but it wasn't enough for guaranteed). I won the 50/50, did 20 more pulls for Yanfei and then rumors of Ganyu coming back started to go around so i stopped.

I skipped the next patch, but Kazuha tempted me so much. iirc with my remaining primos since Zhongli and thanks to Golden Apple Achripeligo, thorough exploration of Teyvat, and 27 - 33 star spiral abyss, i had enough to get him guaranteed but then I'd be broke. I built my pity to 68 during his banner but then chickened out cuz of Ganyu rerun rumors and decided to go for him on his rerun (Ganyu didn't come in 2.0, 2.1, 2.2 or 2.3 so i basically got clowned)

2.0 and 2.1 were easy skips for me so nothing interesting happened there. Then in 2.2 i was already thinking abt pulling for SoH to free my Xiao from his 4* weapon, i hadn't pulled on any character banners for so long that my wish history was being cleared in the game. While building pity on the weapon banner Polar Star ruined my pity at 41.

When Hu Tao (Homa) banner started i had 140-150 wishes (around 25k primos?) for guaranteed Ganyu, and some extra fates that combined with 68 built pity, would either let me reach soft pity for Albedo's rerun twice, or a 50/50 for Albedo and enough for one soft pity on the weapon banner. I chose the latter, got a freaking Elegy at 70-ish but then by some miracle, 2 single pulls later i got SoH and i stopped pulling on the weapon banner. 

2.3 started, i lost 50/50 for Albedo (it's always Mona) and built pity till 71 but chickened out again. I had a guaranteed Ganyu within 10 pulls so i spared 20 wishes on the Standard banner after several months and got yet another Mona and stopped. And finally today, i have reached my goal for Ganyu and guaranteed Kazuha. 

After all this time with 27 - 30 star spiral abyss (it got much harder for me after Ayaka banner) and minimal Inazuma exploration, i have 10 fates baught with Stardust for Ganyu, 133 pulls for Kazuha which will be 140 with the primo i get for doing dailies during his rerun banner, meaning that after Ganyu i am free to be an impulsive puller for whoever i want, as long as i don't touch the 133 pulls i have now. Fun fact...i hate math. I hate it but I've been doing it everyday for a bunch of pixels.

SUMMARY: if i hadn't wished on anything after getting Zhongli on the first day of his rerun, i believe I'd have at least 400 fates rn. I saved all my starglitter for fates, didn't pull on standard banner, didn't risk my pity for Sayu, Thoma, Sara, Rosaria or Gorou (tho i did build pity for Kazuha and Albedo before chickening out), got an average of 30 stars from spiral abyss, never missed my dailies, did all the main quests and a lot of world quests, did the hangouts up until Thoma's, and the result is &gt; 

1 Polar Star (~40 pulls) - 1 Elegy for The End (~70 pulls) - 1 Staff of Homeless (2 pulls) - 1 Mona from Character Event banner (~76 pulls) - 1 Mona from Standard banner (~20 pulls) - 71 built pity on Character Event banner - 144 pulls ready in total (= guaranteed Ganyu in 10 pulls + guaranteed Kazuha)",1641100821

My total Inazuma exploration is about 50% and it’s probably gonna stay that way. I have so much content to do but all I do is log in for commission and resin and log out.

I don’t find exploring or doing quests fun anymore and I purely enjoy doing abyss and collecting new characters to do abyss. It seems so ironic because when I started the game, I was the polar opposite.
I find almost every ounce of dialogue a drag now after Inazumas spectacularly bad writing of the archon quest and Paimon especially makes me want to rip my hair out. Because of that I avoid all quests and just grind to min max my account for abyss even though I have about 20+ hours worth of quests and exploration left.",1641101271
