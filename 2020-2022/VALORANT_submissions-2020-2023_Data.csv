VALORANT,2020,3,"Hi, welcome to the ***VALORANT*** subreddit. As the team behind it, we hope this becomes the official subreddit because it's the shortest thing to type. That said, if all of you want to go elsewhere to talk about the game, we'll follow.

If it wasn't obvious, we set this thing up with the help of previous community moderators and leaders known to us and will now **be passing off ownership to them.** The agreement here is that they'll act as the starter seed of mods who will then begin recruiting positive figures from the VALORANT community who want to keep all of us in check. Reddit is obviously a huge, crazy, *crazy huge* platform when it comes to putting eyeballs on things, and we want to make sure whoever's supporting the community doesn't *also* want their content to be on the front page of that community. It's fine to be one or the other, but typically not both.

Anyway, that's about it. The whole team is crazy hyped to finally be able to talk about this game - we love it and hope you love it too when you get in. More importantly, we hope you all become a VALORANT community *of* love: one that celebrates competition and skill and creativity, but also audacity and style and high-risk plays for the sake of it. This game is going to be hard to master but also (hopefully) worth the effort - let's bring together a global tribe of friends who make the journey as fun as the destination.

The team will be here to say hi - also I'll give out a random 5k RP to whoever shitposts the best, as dictated by me exhaling slightly out of the nose upon reading. This isn't an assumption that anyone who wants to play VALORANT plays League (I wonder about the crossover) but it's all I have to give.

If you're wondering when closed beta begins, follow us on:

* [twitter](https://www.twitter.com/playvalorant) 
* [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/playvalorantofficial) 
* [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/playvalorant) 

.. and maybe they'll tell you one day. There's definitely some cool stuff planned.

We'll swing by and do a proper AMA in the coming weeks once we get some other things locked down, but feel free to ask questions as we go and we'll be available. Happy discussing, folks.",1583133739

VALORANT,2020,3,"for preface im from a cs background and have had some experience playing at a competitive level through some lans and online leagues/tournaments so these are some things I found to seem important from a **CS PLAYER POV**.

* I did not see any sort of **'defuse kit'-like item** in the buy menu, but that's not to say that a champ/hero may or may not have an ability to decrease defuse time. after counting the defuse time from the round video, it seemed that it was around *8 seconds or so* (correct me if im wrong)
* **the in-game voice quality is really nice!** its refreshing to know that we can go into a team-based game with a well-establish communication system. one thing im curious on, which I highly doubt will happen, is whether there will be a point in the match in which there is interaction between the two teams. i remember in CSGO a few years ago, shit talking the enemy at half-time or at end of the match was a thing and honestly I think it not only gave the chance for '*friendly banter*' but it also gave the players another sort of possible 'motivation' to win the match they are in.
* \-in the buy menu, **you seem to 'buy' access to your abilities**. to some this might be compared to buying grenades in other FPS games. another major thing I noticed in the round gameplay video was the ability to **BUY FOR OTHERS, ASK FOR WEAPONS/ETC FROM OTHERS, AND OVERALL GIVE BASIC COMMS SUCH AS ""Let's Save""**. along the same subject, I really have to say that the buy menu is *really* well done and seems very easy to navigate.
* \-**the crosshair system** seems very similar to CSGO's and im excited to know that we the players are given access to personalize our own.
* **there seems to be an almost 30-second 'setup' time for what I am assuming is the CT side** that we were able to see in the gameplay video. with this teams are able to create set-pieces and tactics that might otherwise seem difficult without the '*grace period*' that we are given.
* **you can pick up and drop weapons** for your teammates similarly to CSGO. though it should seem like a no-brainer mechanic to have in an FPS, im glad to know definitely that it is present
* **the mini-map system and UI in general seem very sleek and do not take up a whole lot of the player's POV/screen.** It also is fairly *calm* which is a great thing in my eyes. excited to see what UI customization is available to the players on release (HUD Color, Scaling, etc)
* when it comes to movement, it's hard to tell just how good or bad it is without physically playing, however I do notice that again, similarly to CSGO and other FPS games, **movement speed increases with knife/melee(?) out.**
* **the damage report is very informative** in the fact that **not only does it show how much damage you each did to each other, but also where on the body you were and the other person was hit, as well as with what weapon the damage was done.**
* **recoil patterns do seem to exist,** so there will be more than likely different spreads for each weapon

i think i covered almost everything that stood out to me, but honestly after rewatching the gameplay, i will probably find something new. in general, im really excited for this game and what it all has to offer and i think the promise is there for it to blow some major names out of the water. let me know in the comments if there was anything you guys found interesting and why! looking more forward than ever to grinding this game out in hopes of becoming the greatest. *see you all in game* \^\_\^ - **cohnah**",1583138211

VALORANT,2020,3,"A pretty cool idea that came to my mind when I first saw the characters in Valorant was Crossover Events. Some of the Characters look similar to League of Legends Champions and we could get Skins based on League Champions.

Events and Missions could be pretty cool, Skins or Maps based on League and who knows, maybe a Valorant event in League (as the Continent in League is called Valoran)

Another thing that came to mind was Missions and Rewards similar to the Overwatch and Heroes of The Storm Missions. For those of you who aren't aware, you used to be able to play HotS for a Overwatch Genji and D.Va Skin. I think something like that should exist in Valorant and League, it could bring new players to both games.

What other things do you expect Riot to do?

But here I can legitimately say ""it's CS with grenades replaced with Overwatch abilities"", and anyone who played both games will immediately have a very accurate representation of Valorant.

So I'm wondering, who is this for ?

Most CS players won't move, I mean, CS Source was already too different for most of them.

Overwatch players probably won't move, the absence of respawn alone would probably drives them away.

I personally don't like either of those (I think CS is kind of boring, and Overwatch meta is too stiff), but I always wanted something in-between. But this is not in-between, it's a CS clone sprinkled with particles of Overwatch.",1583148535

I'd love to see Riot make some more fluid maps or just *parts* of the maps. Really all I'm seeing is a bunch of boxes wich can be good for a better understanding of the battlefield and will be important in proffesional play, I'm just saying a little more fluidity wouldn't hurt.

# PC HARDWARE RECOMMENDATIONS

* Windows 7/8/10 64 bit
* 4GB RAM
* 1GB VRAM

#  MINIMUM SPECS — 30 FPS

According to Riot, the baseline hardware that you’ll need to run the game at just 30 frames-per-second is basically equivalent to an older laptop, and won’t even need a dedicated graphics card. Unfortunately, at just 30 FPS, you won’t have the easiest time out-aiming players with faster computers, but you’ll at least be able to play Valorant pretty well.

* CPU: Intel i3-370M
* GPU: Intel HD 3000

#  RECOMMENDED SPECS — 60 FPS

&gt;60 FPS should give players a pretty good experience with the game. Running the game with these specs should let you hang with just about anyone in terms of aim, and your computer shouldn’t slow down when abilities start going off and rounds start to get chaotic.

* CPU: Intel i3-4150
* GPU: Geforce GT 730

#  HIGH-END SPECS — 144+ FPS

&gt;These are the specs you’ll want if you want to be the hardest of hardcore *Valorant* players. At 144 FPS you’ll be maxing out most consumer monitors’ refresh rates, and guaranteeing that you’re seeing every frame the game can give you. As far as this kind of top-end performance goes, these specs aren’t particularly demanding, and most gaming computers built within the last few years should have no trouble getting *Valorant* to run at over 144 FPS. Of course, just like any shooter, more frames may help you see things better, but the frames can’t learn to aim for you.

* CPU: Intel Core i5-4460 3.2GHz
* GPU: GTX 1050 Ti",1583157125
VALORANT,2020,3,"My knowledge is strictly limited to the gameplay videos shown and one article about the characters skillset. I also played OW and CS go a decent amount.  


My point is actually pretty simple. They wanted to make an ability based shooter where the gunplay is still important. How can they do that? Few damaging ability and tons of utility. People had bad experience with ""wallhack"" type abilities (or hack lol) so they hate even the ide of it in a ""skillbased shooter"". Wh is op in a vacuum, but big secret, you should watch the whole game to judge. As far as I know the sensor spells are still quite tricky to use in a sense that you have to have a line of sight  from the arrow or drone or whatever to actually see something. But the more important thing is, for every ""wh"" spell there are like 2 vision denial spells from other characters so IMO it would be unplayable without those sensors. There are other games with these kind of abilities where they pulled it off smoothly, like the hanzo arrow or widow ult, so just give them a chance.  


Also if you think the abilites are too monumental or have too big impact just go back to cs:go they won't tune down the only thing that makes their game different.",1583157194

VALORANT,2020,3,"This game seems to amplify that issue significantly. 

Between all the walls and obscuring abilities, I have a feeling it's going to create some frustration with players. Especially those coming from CSGO, which seem to be the target audience. 

I dunno. Just seems like a lot going on at all times. Central zones are going to be completely covered with these obscuring abilities and teamfights are going to devolve into chaos. Once a meta forms, parts of the map are always going to be shut down 100% of the time, which can lead to stagnation and stale gameplay.

VALORANT,2020,3,"**It's the amount of HP we have.**

It doesn't seem that important for CSGO players because in general, a gunfight rarely ends with both players alive. It's decided instantly with very few shots.

However, in games like Overwatch, where abilities are present, there's an HP pool large enough to back away to safety. heal. whatever.

&amp;#x200B;

**Here's is the problem : Is this game more of a CSGO or an Overwatch in terms of HP pool ?**

* If it's more CSGO : RECON and REVIVE abilities will be extremely important and powered. healing isn't worth it if you die instantly. Aggressive abilities like dashes won't be used. Except Grenades-like abilities.
* If it's more like OW : RECON and REVIVE will be important. But as much as Healing. we will see  a more diverse meta.

In any RPG, HP pool is important, its very existence is the reason we have the time to cast spells.

VALORANT,2020,3,"First of all I want to thank everyone who helped in dev this game and I hope this will be a succes!

 Alright guys so I wanted to talk about a character in the game. Let me introduce you to our MOROCCAN agent ""Cypher"" !  
Well, let's do this! I also wanna thank you all for your support.  
So just to be sure and make things clear there is no secret safe in Valorant when Cypher is in the game Detective!

He got some awesome stuff like :

• Trapwire  
• Cyber Cage  
• Signature Ability: Spycam  
• Ultimate Ability: Neural Theft

Cypher is a one-man surveillance network who keeps tabs on the enemy’s every move. No secret is safe. No maneuver goes unseen. Cypher is always watching.

• Free Ability: Trapwire - Place a stealthed tripwire between two walls. Triggering enemies are restrained and revealed for a short time. If the trap is not destroyed, it activates to daze the trapped victim. Can be picked up.  
• Cyber Cage - Toss out a remote activation trap. Reactivate to create a cage that slows enemies who pass through it. Look at a trap and press USE to detonate it, or hold ACTIVATE to detonate all.  
• Signature Ability: Spycam - Place a remote camera. After placing, reactivate to view the video feed. Left click while in camera to fire a tracking dart. Recharges when picked up or killed.  
• Ultimate: Neural Theft- Extract information from the corpse of an enemy, revealing the location of their living allies.

VALORANT,2020,3,"After today's release, I've seen what the current characters (or champions? Idk how they're officially called) can do and some of them look really interesting to me. Here are my first impressions on each one:

* **PHOENIX**: this is one that really caught my attention. His flame walls are useful to take out enemy sight of your team and his ultimate allows him to invade and get intel without worring about being punished as he will respawn right after, even having the chance of getting a kill in the process. Plus, it's specially useful if he is low on health, as he spawns with full health.
* **JETT:** it's not clear for me how useful her daggers are. Sure, they kill on headshots, but don't most of the other weapons do it as well? She can jump high, which might be an advantage to reach potential shooting points, but other than that I don't see much use for her.
* **VIPER:** useful for causing area damage, but even more useful to defend a bomb site with her ultimate. Her gas don't kill (aside Snakebite), but it causes Decay damage that heals after time, so I believe she is an amazing duo for all the other characters.
* **SOVA:** the abilities that tag enemies and the drone (specially the drone) are amazing. Droning is crucial in tactical games like this, specially in situations of invading or retaking bomb sites. Plus, the ""Hanzo arrows"" that tag enemies make excellent combos with Phoenix and Viper, for example.
* **CYPHER:** at first, his abilities seem good but I think they would be the kind of things players get used to search for after some time playing, killing the ""surprise element"". His ultimate is good, though, and his camera will be amazing if it can be placed anywhere regardless of height.
* **BRIMSTONE:** interesting character, but I wonder how will his gameplay be indoors. Will all the maps in Valorant have a great outdoor section?
* **SAGE:** another one that I think will find place in every team, as her ressurection and healing abilities are extremely useful. Her walls make it even easier to take care of wounded teammates.
* **OMEN:** his ultimate is extremely useful, but the rest of his abilities look like... somewhat of a nerfed Reaper? (from Overwatch)

&amp;#x200B;

Of course I need to play first in order to have a solid impression, but on a first glance I would find more sinergy in a team composed by Phoenix, Viper, Sage, Sova and... maybe Brimstone or Omen?",1583169480

VALORANT,2020,3,"It will be a lot of text, but there is a lot of new info so it's worth a read.*I want to state that he wasn't paid by Riot, he was just answering questions*

At the time, alfa testers could play only 2 maps - one of which is 3 sites map shown on the footage, and second is 2 sided map.

**That second map has 2 teleports which as a ct you can travel to second bombsite**, but only once (once you teleport you can't come back). He said it really changes the pace of map, but he liked 3-sided more 

But let's start from the beginning. There ware 8 characters but defs are working at 4 more which will be propably released with premiere. Every character has 4 abilities: 2 of them you can buy (in different amount for different characters), one is available in every round after cooldown (30/40 seconds - it depends) and one **ultimatum which you can't buy**. Instead you have to get points. Every point is counted by: kill, death, or you can pick orbs - there are 2 of them on the same spot resping every round. It takes 7/8 points to get ult.

**Maybe most important info about the game is that trailer doesn't really show how it feels**. He was saying that they are clearly overusing abilities just to show them in the short period of time. They are not more then addition, and not single one is better then precise aim or good movement. It's not optimal to use them so much as shown, because they are not so good - we won't see them as frequently. It's easy to counterplay them, they are easily noticable and you can't avoid them(shooting down wallhack arrow for example, rushing dron deployer, spamming mid air dart thrower). If you have good aim - you will still have an advantage 

**Weapons are clearly overworked cs weapons** There is AWP, scout, galil, famas, m4 with silencer, ak-47, smgs, shotguns and pistols, really same thing. Only diffrence is that they are two or three weapons that you can zoom in, and it changes the way you are shooting. For example there is weapon thay you can spray with, but if you zoom in you will be able to burst only. There is weapon that you can tap only too (it has 12 bullets)

Movement is similar to cs, but acceleration is visibly smaller. It results with that you can't really be killed by jiggle peaking.

**Shooting is 1 to 1 taken from cs go** Players from cs will have huge advantage over new or OW players. (PashaBiceps [cs go ex pro] for example when he was focused on killing, not using abilities - had 29 kills for map) Spraying is same as in cs, but patterns are diffrent. You are even less accurate than in cs while running.

Edit: Sounds are very clear, footsteps even more noticeable than in CS,  most of abilities can be heard as well

Edit: One funny thing: in CS there was an update with a menu that changes crosshair. He said that some alpha tester had to leak Valorant system to Valve because it's too similar. (As you can see CS is already trying to concur with it)

Edit: And a one big thing. There will be a new system called shadow of war or smth like that, which doesn't give your PC information where the enemies stand till you see them. It's supposed to be a weapon with cheaters. Edit: it appears to be in cs as well

On the downsides he said that movement feels a little bit too slow for him, and maps are too flat.

To summerize - it's cs with new stuff. **In his opinion it will be very attractive to cs go community**, and he thinks that **this game have huge potential, which isn't visible on the trailers**. Personally he loved it, in his opinon its in some aspects better than cs go and will hugely affect it (note that he has over 9k hours in cs) but he didn't like trailer

Every person has their own tastes, and that's fine. At least people will be able to use stretched res to customize the look and fe-

Oh no. I know this is Riot Games first shooter, but look. Visual customization is a huge factor in competitive fps games. With this game catching the eyes of many CS:GO and R6 players, no stretched res is a big problem. A lot of people like their game looking dummy thicc. Let them play like that. It's only going to make more people like the look and feel of you game.

If you're going to go through the hassle of recruiting multiple CS:GO/R6 pros, ex-pros, and streamers to play test your game for their personal suggestions and feedback about everything else, take a second to ask them about this too.

VALORANT,2020,3,It’s true,1583189934
VALORANT,2020,3,[deleted],1583190049
VALORANT,2020,3,Release Date Confirmed? /s,1583190213
VALORANT,2020,3,"I know we don't know yet as to what the esport scene will look like, but I am terrified for Valorant's based off of the League of Legends scene. 

While a franchising offers more stability, in the long run it will stifle and suffocate the competitive scene, as it only offers opportunities for good individual players to be picked up by orgs. 

In CS:GO you have tournaments with open qualifiers, which allows for people to have a chance to make a name for themselves *as a team*. In league there is just no opportunities for teams to ever be able to make it to pro because you would have to buy in, or magically get picked up by an org that drops their whole roster (never gonna happen).

The last thing I want as someone aspiring to go pro in this game is to have to stream everyday and be top 100 to get a chance to get picked up by an org, when I could potentially have a team that could stomp everybody in pro play. They need to have open qualifiers to allow teams to be able to earn their name and oust ""pro"" teams, should they prove themselves better. Look at DotA. OG lost their spot with Fly and s4 leaving so they had to play ceb and pick up topsen and they had to go through open qualifiers for TI8. And then they won. This is what Valorant needs in it's esport scene: open qualifiers that allow a chance for ANYBODY to win the entire thing, because anyone should be able to make a team and compete. 

League of Legends only has two seasons each year, both of which teams are bought into. No new teams. So the only way to get in is to be picked up as a player by one of those teams. So it's hard to go pro, and encourages players to pug rather than learn teamplay elements and form teams to try to qualify for events and go pro. The only tournaments are invite tournaments from the best teams in the aforementioned seasons. Imagine how many good teams we might have right now in the LoL esport scene if there were open qualifiers, because there would be squads of players who develop their team skills together and eventually qualify rather than just pug and stream in hopes of being picked up. The League of Legends esport scene is extremely stale, especially compared to esports such as R6, CS:GO, and DotA, all of which have open qualifiers and more tournaments.

Another thing is fostering team play talent. In CS:GO ESEA has leagues, with divisions Open, Intermediate, Main, Advanced, MDL, and ESL Pro League. These are season based leagues that are always going on every 3 months (with month long breaks in-between) that allow players to get practice in a team and competitive environment that is completely different than the pugging environment. This builds up players and allows them to hone the skills they'll need to perform at the pro level. It also allows an opportunity to make their team professional. FURIA is a team I remember seeing play in Main, and they went 16-0 in season play and 8-0 in playoffs, made MDL, and then Pro League. Now they are a top 30 pro team in CS:GO. ESEA provided an opportunity for a younger org and team to make a name for themselves and enter the pro scene. And of course, in LoL, you don't have leagues like this, so there is no opportunity for players to get competitive experience in team, league, and tournament environments with prize pools, because they only pug. This cannot happen with Valorant if we want a truly healthy esport scene. 

Having open qualifiers for most tournaments and leagues, in addition to franchised leagues is what will make an esport feel truly vibrant and allow it to grow. It offers opportunities for teams and players to actually make a name for themselves and allows for talent to actually get spotted much better, in a way that you don't get in League of Legends. 

So yes, we do need franchising so players don't get exhausted with poor tournament scheduling: *to an extent*. The aforementioned is more important however. I would choose the CS:GO esport scene style with individual tournaments from Dreamhack, ESL, FACEIT, and more any day of the week rather than franchising. 

Please Riot: open qualifiers, more tournaments (*with open qualifiers*), in addition to everything else. FOSTER upcoming talent instead of encouraging orgs to make boring decisions and use players that are already in the system rather than take chances on upcoming talent. Encourage people to make teams and compete for spots in pro, because it encourages orgs to scout out team talent in addition to player talent.",1583190326

VALORANT,2020,3,"Now hear me out! Im baked but i might be on to something here! Ive been researching Valorant, Project A and Ares before it was shown at the 10 year anniversary. 

I knew Riot was planning on doing an Fps for quite some time... so i was just waiting for the confirmation. 

Now here is my insane theory that i sculpted out of the best weed one can find. If you play a regular game of Counter Strike, you call your mates and say : Hey, lets go play some Cs... Now Valorants short ""name"" will be ""Vr""!

Maybe this is very off but I strongly believe, especially because they focus on performance (a 10 year old Pc can run Valorant with 30 fps) that this game is going for Virtual reality.  This would be an ""extra"" thing for obv reasons and the main focus will be on mouse and keyboard... But Riot cant give that name with no reason .... they do everything for a reason and I believe to have found this one.

VALORANT,2020,3,"@HenryGcsgo on Twitter

&gt;I didn't get a chance to play every single character in great depth. From what I gathered. It's a hanzo like arrow that shows intel for a few seconds but can also be destroyed before info is given up. I will have to report on that properly later down the line.

VALORANT,2020,3,[removed],1583205026
VALORANT,2020,3,"Was taking a look at sources posted online about abilities of the Agents that we'll get to play from the trailers &amp; game play of content creators that have shared information.

Some things to note about an Agent's kite is that they have two core abilities; a Signature and an Ultimate ability. These two are separate from the shop economy. Ultimate Abilities will always go by a Point System- the most common case I've seen of gaining these points is through kills, but the maps seem to have orbs throughout it and will most likely assist in this matter. As for Signature Abilities we have examples of Cooldown (Sage as an example), Point System, and Unique (Viper and Brimstone). Shop abilities seem to allow players to purchase up to 1-3 in quantity reaching from Agent to Agent.

**Phoenix:** Signature Ability: *Curveball* - A flash bang like ability. This ability uses a Point System and it takes two points to recharge the ability.

Ultimate Ability: *Run it Back* - Choose a location and when you die during the duration you'll be reborn there with full health. From the character breakdown on Polygon it also mentions ""or when this ability's duration expires"" so I'm curious if it also has Tracer like effect. Another factor I'm curious about is if you'll keep your weapons when reborn. This ability uses a Point System and requires 6 in total to gain access to it.

*Hot Hands* - Seems to act like the Molotov but has the addition benefit of healing Phoenix. It'll explode after a delay in the air (assuming) or when it reaches the ground (maybe a wall as well?). This ability is bought through the store (I heard details about ability economy being separate from weapons? Need more information), cost is unknown but you can buy up to two of these.

*Blaze* - A wall of flame will block vision and damage anyone that passes through it. From comments you bend the wall. This ability is bought through the store, cost is unknown but you can buy up one.

**Jett:** Signature Ability: *Tailwind* - A dash that goes into the direction you're moving. This ability uses the Point System and requires two points to recharge.

Ultimate Ability: *Blade Storm* - Gain access to 5 wind daggers. A kill with restores all daggers. Left click is a single while right click throws all remaining daggers. Requires 6(?) points to gain access.

*Cloudburst* - A dense smoke grenade by the looks of it. This ability is bought, cost is unknown but you can buy up to three.

*Updraft* - This ability propels you upwards. This ability is bought, cost is unknown but you can buy up to two.

**Viper:** Signature Ability: *Toxic Screen* - A line of gas emits from chosen location. Didn't see enough videos to see if the ability is always on the same portion of the map each time, but from a single video the ability was always in the same spot for three rounds. This ability uses Fuel (Unique) and as long as you have Fuel you can reactivate this ability. Blocks visual but players are able to move through it freely- green on mini map shows it is active and blue for inactive.

Ultimate Ability: *Viper's Pit* - Massive toxic cloud in an area. Looks to constantly drain enemies health when inside but doesn't kill- enemies will regain health when outside the pit. Viper can see highlighted enemies when they are inside. Requires 7 points to gain access.

*Snakebite* - Pool of acid, didn't see any video of this so I'm going to guess it is like a Molotov effect. This ability is bought, cost is unknown but you can buy up to two.

*Poison Cloud* - Similar to Jett's Cloudburst but lethal. Apparently this can be picked up and thrown again and always usable as long as Viper has Fuel.

**Sova:** Signature Ability: *Recon Bolt* - Like Hanzo's ability to reveal enemies but has a requirement of Line of Sight to the bolt, apparently it can be destroyed, can bounce, and can shoot over ledges. Didn't see any footage of Sova so unsure if this ability uses the Point System, has a Cooldown, or is Unique.

Ultimate Ability: *Hunter's Fury* - Fires three blasts of energy, didn't see any footage of this one yet. Points required is unknown at the moment.

*Shock Bolt* - Explosive bolt that pluses out static energy. This ability is bought, cost is unknown and the amount you can buy is unknown.

*Owl Drone* - A drone that can fly out for recon and shoot darts to reveal enemies that are hit. This ability is bought, cost is unknown and the amount you can buy is unknown.

*Cypher:** Signature Ability: *Spycam* - Can place a cam around map, and access it similar to Rainbow 6 Siege. Can fire a dart to reveal enemies. Unsure if ability is Point System, Cooldown or Unique.

Ultimate Ability: *Neural Theft* - Gain information from an enemy's corpse to reveal the location of the remaining enemies. Point amount is unknown for access.

*Trapwire* - Stealth tripwire between walls. Triggering it restrains and reveals enemies. This ability is bought, cost &amp; carry amount is unknown.

*Cyber Cage* - A remote trap that slow enemies. This ability is bought, cost &amp; carry amount is unknown.

**Brimstone:** Signature Ability: *Sky Smoke* a global smokescreen similar to Cloudburst. Can access any point of the map and even indoors it seems (unsure). You can have up to three of these but the way to gain them is unknown- the spot that shows Point System or Cooldown indicators doesn't float around that ability.

Ultimate Ability: *Orbital Strike* - Choose a location on the map and launch (missles?) to that location. Requires 6 points to gain access.

*Incendiary* -  Unsure if this is like the Molotov as well but apparently it can damage allies and enemies. This ability is bought, cost is unknown but you can buy up to one.

*Stim Beacon* - A beacon that gives Rapid fire to nearby players. Some posts online say select a location but some footage shows Brimstone throwing the Beacon. Rapid fire buff is unknown but I'd imagine it's straightforward considering its name. This ability is bought, cost is unknown but you can buy up to two.

**Sage:** Signature Ability: *Healing Orb* - Heal yourself or throw an orb to an ally to heal to full(?) health over five seconds. This ability has a Cooldown of 35 seconds.

Ultimate Ability: *Resurrection* - Revives an ally. Channel time is unknown, based on very early alpha footage it is shorter then Healing Orb duration but I bet that has changed. Points required is 7 to gain access.

*Slow Orb* - Creates a field on the ground that slows players and increase their noise when moving on it. This ability is bought, cost is unknown but you can buy up to two.

*Barrier Orb* - An ice wall that can be broken through (in sections from early footage). This ability is bought, cost is unknown but you can buy up to one.

Stuff is unknown about this Agent but I'll include his basic information.

**Omen:** Signature Ability: *Dark Cover* - I imagine this is like Cloudburst but distance can be increased by charging it (holding left click I'd imagine).

Ultimate Ability: *From the Shadows* - If you're familiar with League of Legends I'd compare this very much to Twisted Fate mixed with Reaper from Overwatch. From Polygon it's quoted as this: "" Select anywhere on the map to teleport and reform. When arriving, appear as a Shade, that will go back to your original location if killed. Once the teleport is complete, become Incorporeal for a short time.""

*Paranoia* - A straight line shadow that causes nearsightedness to anyone that touches it. 

*Shadow Walk* - Teleport a short distance, similar to Reaper from Overwatch I'd imagine since you materialize. 


I hope some of this brings more information about the Agents, especially their core abilities that separate from the shop economy. There seems to be a design choice of scouting information (Sova and Cypher), area denial, or a terms of smoke grenades in the Agents. I'm curious how players will look to build their teams to fill requires based on maps or abilities needed to gain the edge.",1583206161

VALORANT,2020,3,"I'll be trying to make an organized guide to everything we saw in the recent gameplay previews, as well as a guide to each character's kit and some other gameplay basics.

&amp;#x200B;

*Match Format*

5v5 Best of 25 Rounds (1:40 combat per round)

A transparent, indestructible barrier is present for 30 seconds at the beginning of each round.

Bomb plant removes the timer from the HUD, though it lasts 45 seconds until detonation. (After defusing, the timer re-appears on the HUD to show how much time was left as the defuse finished.)

&amp;#x200B;

*Abilities*

4 Abilities per character

2 **Standard Abilities** which must be bought with the same currency as weapons

1 **Signature Ability** which is given for free at the start of each round

1 **Ultimate Ability** which charges in two ways:

1. Getting a specific number of kills (The number varies for each ability)
2. Picking up an orb at certain points of the map (Currently unsure of how many kills the orb is equivalent to)

&amp;#x200B;

*Health*

100 base health

Up to 50 shield can be purchased. Important to note that in gunfights, your shield only mitigates incoming damage. You will still take HP damage with a shield active, it will just be less HP damage.

VALORANT,2020,3,"*Classick answered a ton of questions on the Gameplay-Discussion channel in the official Valorant discord. Here are most of the questions and answers.*

------------------

**@Classick: My official title is lead game designer, per relevance to this channel I worked on many of the weapons for the game.**

&gt;Whats the name for the ""Champions"" do we call them agents? or Heroes?

**Agents**

&gt;Do weapons have recoil? 

**The weapons have recoil, bloom/spread/error, and most can use ADS as well (as shown in the vid)**

&gt; I'm assuming whilst you move and shoot the recoil is increased as you are moving?

**ya**

&gt;Is there movement inaccuracy ?

**Different gun types have different movement accuracy**

&gt;Any news on spray patterns vs recoil? 

**I was thinking about doing a more in-depth write up for this one, I'll work on that.**

&gt;Does shooting with weapons cause camera shake?

**As shown in the video, yes**

&gt;Are abilities affected by recoil and running?

**It's dependent on the ability. As shown in the video, one of the primary strengths of the Kunai is that you can use it accurately on the move.**

&gt;Can we shoot through walls? 

**Yes there's wall-pen, but we use a system to prevent egregious stuff like cross-map pen through lots of walls etc.**

&gt;What about penetration? shooting through two people?

**yea same idea**

&gt;Do weapons have different reload speeds/sounds?

**Each weapon has a unique reload time, with sound broadcast**.

&gt;Can we ricochet abilities for more tactical use?

**This is probably better for \#agent-discussion** [*note: this is a Discord channel*] **, but abilities are intended to have tactical uses. So that means delivery methods that don't require direct line of sight on your opponent.**

 &gt;I don't think this should be asked here, but it's still a mechanic for shooting so, is there leaning in the game?

 **No leaning**

&gt;1 bullet headshot kills on most guns?

**There are 1 bullet headshots, not for all guns though.**

&gt;Customizable crosshairs or fixed depending the gun?

**You can customize your crosshair, in the video reveal you can see different settings.**


&gt;Do characters heal over time if not damaged?

**No that's Agent abilities that are providing healing**

&gt;Anyone knows if all signature abilities have cooldowns? or it is only for some agents and for others it is single use?

**Signature effects are unique per character**

&gt;During the use of abilities, the character seems to be unarmed. Will there be a delay to take the weapon back in hands?

**It's intentional that using your agent abilities over your weapon is an intentional choice and will take commitment. Knowing when to have your gun out versus your abilities is important.**


&gt;Whats your favorite agent?

**I'd have to say my favorite is Omen, followed up by Brimstone.**

&gt;does brimstones stimpack work during pistol round

**This ability works on all rounds!**


&gt;Is there bunny hop in Valorant?

**We'd like movement to be expressive in Valorant, letting players pull off trick jumps etc. We don't intend on players moving around the map at huge speeds though.**
 

&gt;Will there be pistol rounds, or can players buy bigger guns right at the start?

**You have a set of money on first round that sets what you can purchase.**


&gt; When we saw the money economy when the guy had around 5k and the next round the minimal income was of 7.4k. He gets the 2.4k right?

**This means minimum possible income for that round. So you don't acquire money from any other action, die/lose round.**

&gt;What's the philosophy behind the roles of the different guns in the economy? Are cheaper guns used for economy reasons (like CS), or are you aiming to have the guns be more situational/player preference (more of a CoD sort of approach)?

**Ideally a mixture of both, economic status it will inform different gun choices. Also, the set of weapons at each economic range give you options based on playstyle/situation/Agent synergy etc.**

&gt;Is the guardian intended to be a viable primary alternative (like the ak/m4 in CS) to the other rifles? Or more of a situational weapon? And does it 2 or 3 shot to the body? Also, I noticed there is a crosshair when hipfiring the Operator, is hipfiring accurate with this and presumably the other sniper?

**It's another rifle option that will be based on playstyle preference. It's in a similar price range to compete with other rifles. Shots to body depends on armor. Hipfire on operator has some spread but not reflected in the video due to the player's crosshair settings.**

&gt;Are there any plans on patches after the game releases. (Every 2 weeks a patch like league)?

**We plan to operate as a live service, making updates to the game. The cadence for those updates has not yet been defined.**

&gt;Will there be multiple game modes at release or only the bomb plant scenario?

**Exploration of additional modes is definitely a consideration, but we're focusing efforts on the core mode at the moment.**

&gt;Will all maps have 3 bomb plants?

**Each map has unique elements, 3 sites is unique addition for this map.**

&gt;What is the server tick rate?

**128 tick, as mentioned in some articles that just released.**

&gt;Since there is no global utility, I think this quite promotes maining/onetricking. How will Valorant go around this? Can you have multiple of one character in a team? Can you queue as a character and a 2nd character like queuing as a role in league?

**We'll see as the game progresses, we have our own theories but open to see how people play and we'll make any adjustments as necessary.**


&gt;Any colorblind options planned?

**Yes, we definitely want to support options  for colorblind spectrums. In progress.**

&gt;How is Valorant linked to League of Legends? Is it even in the same universe?

**Different IP**

&gt;Why [did you guys make] the decision of making every character the same hitbox/health? Doesn't this limit development?

**This deserves a long answer, I'll write something up for later. Simple answer is we've focused on tight, lethal tactical gameplay. Changing hp or hitbox has significant impact on gameplay and we want agents to be chosen for their toolkits, not passive stats like this.**

&gt;Will there be any singleplayer storymode for characters to develop them?

**No singleplayer, but we're interested in further agent development through other methods over time**.

&gt;Utility wise are the skyboxes really capped or you can throw skills everywhere?

**The sky is the limit**

&gt;Will abilities be crucial for the game? 

**We want abilities and gunplay to complement each other. So they'll both be important for success.**

&gt;Ok imma ask a big question can we have a ingame sensitivity converter from other games like cs etc.?

**We'll make sure to provide some conversions for sensitivity from other popular titles**

&gt;Is the art style going to be upgraded/polished as we progress through Patches/Seasons just like in League of Legends?

**Of course, we'll always be looking to improve the game. This is why we really appreciate feedback and suggestions to improve the game as we go into live service.**

&gt;are there plans of having weapon cosmetics ?

 **Sorry not ready to answer this yet!**

&gt;[Is it] gonna be capped 144 hz?

 **Not capped at 144 hz, you can run the game at whatever refresh rate your computer handles.**

&gt;Will there be a ""reconnect"" feature at launch?

**Yeah when you disconnect you'll be able to return**

&gt;How many years ago did you start developing VALORANT? 

**~6 years total, 3 years R&amp;D, 3 years pre-production/production**

VALORANT,2020,3,One thing about I worry is too many update in game meta. It works in LOL but VALORAN is FPS not MOBA. In this type of games it don't works. In CS:GO we didn't have too many changes and it was ok. I'm not including AUG and KRIEG prize changes. Many Major changes was not really good. For example when Valve added Revolver to game it was too OP. Now this gun is useless. So I'm worry about this kind of situations.,1583237392

Fast forward a week of multiple games a day, and here it is my big moment. By the will of the gods, I manage to keep my mouse on someone that's been peppered by bullets and kill em. Deep down I know, but deny, this will be my 1 kill.

The next 2 weeks will be fate harassing me, as I get hits but know kills, going negative every game.

The last few days of the month will consist of me turning corners getting instantly blasted. I will end a month of gaming with a single kill and hate in my heart.

I'm still probably gonna play it the next month anyways. This is taken from multiple attempts at playing shooters with Mouse and Keyboard, like Siege, CSGO, Overwatch, Ect.

VALORANT,2020,3,"Do you think lower end cpus can get similar results on low settings?

Hey, Mochi, what's your load type look like? Will players benefit from SSD's and [NV.ME](https://NV.ME) M.2 Drives?

**This is changing day by day and by machine. you definitely benefit from SSDs vs HDDs in things like load times and texture streaming times, but like in all games, SATA SSD vs NVMe isn't as big a difference as say copying files**

Was viper ult the textures and graphics of it a placeholder cuz it looked so weird in the video?

**Alpha footage, may change or may not change, i'm actually not sure about the viper one in particular**

Are the abilities overused in the trailer to show them in a short time or is this the (normal) use of abilities ?

**The trailer had a lot of abilities and ultimate abilities used, which is more typical of a late-round high-economy**

VALORANT,2020,3,"I know it's not even beta phase and this is not League but I want to get this out there as soon as possible and the game is still made by Riot Games.

In League, players get to flex they are ""good"" with one champion by showing off the mastery level of one champion, which honestly has become an obnoxious behaviour where players spam the damn mastery banner on players faces, making a torturing visual and noise for even that players' teammates. 

This time around you could have cosmetics being a part of that. Reward players with a new jacket or even just a color variation of that jacket (jacket as an example) or a new hairstyle, helmet variation, etc. And as for as the weapons just as much. A color variation like gold and silver.

When it comes to weapons, actually, developers could even go as far as different triggers, magazines, bullets, a blood-written sentence after killing an enemy (which can be a character reward as well) and still not hurt the skin driven economy which Valorant will most definetly have since it's a Free to Play and Riot game.

Hopefully everyone feels as I do and this reaches to developers. Maybe this will already be implemented, jus trying to make sure it does.",1583240932

VALORANT,2020,3,"Am I the only one that thinks this? I'll start off by saying that I like what I'm seeing from the game so far for the most part, but I felt that Riot could've made a better gameplay preview. Although the game is in alpha and everything is subject to change, the first impressions that viewers get from gameplay are very important. I'll list some things that I like about the preview and some things that could've improved it.

\*\*Liked:\*\*

\- Unscripted gameplay. It's nice hearing people talk and strategize naturally like how players like you and me probably would. No cringy acting and reading off a script like a robot

\- Demonstrations of how the abilities are used.

After watching the preview again multiple times... that's about it.

\*\*Improvements:\*\*

\- Longer gameplay time. I felt that the gameplay we were given was too short, I think a longer gameplay preview (around maybe 10-20 mins) would have given viewers more insight on economy, gunplay, game pace, and ability usage frequency.

\- Explanation of gameplay. This doesn't necessarily mean the gameplay has but be scripted but it'd be nice to have a narrator of some sort explaining what's going on, character abilities, etc.

\- Too many abilities shown. I think this is what potentially turn a lot of plays off when first watching the preview, they were clearly focused on showing the abilities off based but didn't balance it with enough gunplay. This gives some viewers the impression that abilities are spammed and that they're more impactful than they really are.

I had to view other content and text to get an idea of what the game is actually like which made me more hyped than viewing the preview because I didn't really get anything from it. Something like this is what the preview should have been like: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muFpmz-LVAk&amp;t=865s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muFpmz-LVAk&amp;t=865s)

VALORANT,2020,3," I’m curious because I feel like, while a lot of people coming from Overwatch will be expecting really high quality cosmetics, as a much more tactical shooter than that or Paladins or other hero shooters, making skins for these characters might make it more difficult to quickly identify what enemy hero you’re suddenly facing off against in a given location and what abilities you’re about to have to face.
This might be especially worrying bc of how quick time to kill is in this game.
Now, of course, you’ll know what abilities might be up each round and you can plan around that and in watching the gameplay video it seems like most abilities are either channeled or buffered which means there shouldn’t be a lot of abilities that threaten more than a gun would in a sudden encounter which should also make skins matter less.

VALORANT,2020,3,PashaBiceps during tests didn't use abilities and he had 29 kills in one match. So abilities have impact in game but if you have problem with them but you have good AIM it won't be problem for you,1583321481
VALORANT,2020,3,"In physically demanding sports with rich history (boxing for example), knowledge is transferred from someone like a trainer or coach. The people who are being coached are getting a much quicker understanding of what is important and get to a much higher level of skill in a shorter amount of time. Letting people train on their own often leads to a much poorer skill LvL compared to someone trained.

Back when I started to play CSGO, I missed a feature guiding me through the fundamentals. Of course you will get the hang of it at some point but the worst players would play a lot better if they knew what they are doing wrong. 

Especially with a very competitive eSports driven game like Valorant fundamentals are very important!

A probable solution for this would be a training map or/and match that tells the player how to react in certain situations. For example:

- Don't overextend 
- stay Def in after plant situations
- refrag 
- abilities and where/when to use them
- spray patterns
- movement like strafing around corners or standing still while shooting
-  effective range for weapons like SMG's or sniper rifles
-  etc. etc.

This may only include a small portion of what is good to know when playing in a competitive round based fps. And maybe I'm even wrong about all of the points stated above, but creating an environment that makes everyone in it a much better player and increasing the skill ceiling much faster by doing so, can only lead to a much more enjoyable playing experience for everyone. :)",1583323350

VALORANT,2020,3,"I quit my career in CS:GO while being a master guardian, which means that I wasn't that great, that's pretty much the point when the game starts to get serious, and you will either quit or marry it. The barrier I couldn't get through was finding the time needed to practice smoking by aimig at the right pixel of the cloud, a very specific amounts of pixels to the left from the electric wire, while standing on the right corner of the box, an exact step to the right from the wooden pole. 

Smoking is a key factor of CS:GO and that game wouldn't work without it, but if we're getting a new product designed from the grounds up, then I hope that this interaction can be improved upon by making it clearer and less time consuming. Smoking isn't an earned skill. It's just something you have to memorize in multiple spots per map, which takes an hour or two of mindlessly screwing around on an empty level once per map, after every time you take a longer break or the map gets any kind of a major overhaul. It's the equivalent of memorizing the multiplication table. You got to know it if you want to get anything done, but neither learning it nor having learnt it feels in any way satisfactory.

I'd like to play Valorant. Please focus on making a game where playing is what we spend time on, not prepping, not printing reference sheets, but interacting with the enemy in an amazing game of cat and mouse. Don't let mechanics spiral out of control out from tradition.",1583339591

-Gunplay is the main focus, spells and all that bullshit aren't as important and if you're bad, will not give you any advantage over a player with good mechanics. (It's like utility in CS)

VALORANT,2020,3,"In an ideal world Riot would introduce blood into the game but we all know that this is very unlikely to happen. Now I'm not a fan of hitmarkers but at the very least we should have audio cues that let us know if we are hitting the target (with distinct audio for headshots) As it is right now, atleast when it comes to the alpha preview they released, I can't tell if a shot is connecting or not; there is no sound, no animation (except for death) or visual effect that indicates if it is, and if there is I couldn't even notice it. I believe this is a very important feature when it comes to fps games and I hope they are considering how to implement it.",1583431527

I play cs:go on 4:3 and I HATE it but I HAVE to because it gives me an advantage when I aim for the head. Why are you want the same thing to be available on Valorant? I cannot understand it, this is 2020 for god's sake. Let's just play the game on 16:9 so we don't suffer from the narrow, blurry, ugly sight of 4:3. Sure people will say ""Then go play on 16:9, no one's forcing you to play on 4:3"". You are wrong, 4:3 players are forcing me to play on 4:3 because it gives free advantage when aiming. Sure it has it's downsides like decreased FOV and faster targets but who cares when oppenent's head is as big as a watermelon.

VALORANT,2020,3,"I remember being ten years old and download a shit ton of mods for 1.6, like super heroes abilities like super man, wolverine and shit, or one that changed the game completely into dragon ball z where you could do tons of things.

And always said things like wow this games needs a sequel with powers and other type of things.

But condition zero and source were more like a remaster than an actual sequel, and csgo, even though it has tons good additions it still feels like the only thing separating it from 1.6 is their qol changes instead of a sequel.

I don't know, maybe that's what they aimed for and I can't blame them, why bother fixing something that is not broken.

What this game seems to be, at least for me, a true sequel of 1.6 in all its glory and I can't wait to play it.

All the news about this game are interesting, good tickrate, anti cheat system day one, the gameplay looks fun and some places reminds me of dust2 and inferno my potato pc is able to run it.

VALORANT,2020,3,"I might be reaching here since abilities and such are subject to change but here's something i have been thinking about after looking at the characters and their abilities that we know of right now:  


*  There are 3 characters with abilities that i have seen being picked a lot in other games. These abilities include ability to resurrect, see through walls and global teleport so i am talking about Sage, Sova and Omen.  

*  If their abilities work the way i am thinking they'll have one of the highest pick rates and or ban rates soon after if banning is going to be a thing.  

*  Excluding the random matchmaking if a team queues with a plan i am sure they'll have one or more of the above characters with a choice between Sova and Cypher.  

*  And as we know once the pick rates go up a nerf always follow. So yeah some of those characters might be among the first to be balanced.  


I would like to know your thoughts on this and add to it or if you think this wont be the case i would like to hear what you have in mind.

Therefore what type of implementation would you prefer? Personally I'd like Valorants' own version of Leagues role select where instead you pick 2-3 characters you are OPEN to playing.

Pros:   
Possibility of playing your chosen character(s)  
Faster queues over a single-pick variant  
Less game dodging  
etc

Cons:   
No one tricking  
Possibility of game dodging if your first chosen picks are taken

VALORANT,2020,3,"In “The Round” Footage we see the Sova at a total of 4900 Cash, we see him buy the Vandal and Heavy Shields which brings him down to 1000 total cash, assuming he’s already bought abilities or didn’t buy any at all. 

  
The total cost is 3900 – So can assume one of two things the Vandal cannot be cheaper than the Phantom at 2900.

  
We go up in price at easy 100s meaning that the vandal can cost anywhere between 3000 – 3800  
We can assume that heavy shields will be more expensive than light shields at 400. This now means that the Vandal can now cost anywhere between 3000 – 3400. Speculation time, an easy plus 25 shields are double the health, so let’s say double the price taking Heavy Shields to 800 in price and the Vandal to 3100.  

  
This makes a lot of sense because both the Vandal and Phantom have very distinct weaknesses and strengths. Phantom outperforming at closer ranges with its higher fire rate at 11/s (no zoom) than Vandals lower fire rate 9.25/s (no zoom) However because the Vandal doesn’t have damage drop off it outperforms the Phantom at longer ranges. Sort of how the AK and the M4 operate in CS.

The footage we’ve seen currently have shown a few maps where they are mainly only holding close angles where you’d be much better off both economically and in raw DPS selecting the Phantom over the Vandal. This is interesting to me because one of the main issues in terms of guns in CS is there are a lot of weapons that are simply never utilised, which brings me to my final point.   

  
I am HOPING that in Valorant with universal gun usage on both sides that there is a conscious effort that maps will determine what type of weapons you’ll want to bring with you. In the example I’ve given, playing a map with a long-range counterpart such as Dust 2 long you’d want to be packing Operators and Vandals over Judges and Phantoms.  

  
If you’ve got this far thanks for reading. 

   
TL:DR Some gun better for other situation than other gun + stats.",1583584371

**Reminder:** Some of these are my assumptions based on what I see q.q  
---  
**[The Round - Valorant Gameplay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8amyzDHOKw)**  
  
- Right at the start, in the top right corner there is a symbol ""Low Server FPS"" that looks like a notification. League of Legends has a similar type of Notification system [although not in-game], where you would have Green/Yellow/Red exclamation symbol to indicate severity of the issue.. for example: Red Symbol - Champion is disabled due to a bug  
- Player names are stated below agent models  
- You can easily review teammate weapons/armor by looking at the items above them while Buy phase is active  
- Teammates and Enemies that have Ultimate ability unlocked will have Yellow stripe shown above their icon on the display bar that shows players who are alive at the moment  
- You can change the position of the radar, enlarge/shrink it.. as well as crop it? So, technically you can zoom-in radar and crop it to a small circle [..to be able to see nothing at all lol] or have it zoomed out and kept in a larger circle to see everything  
- To add to the point above, if your teammate is outside of your radar circle, they will be indicated with arrow pointing towards their direction as seen at ~[0:37](https://youtu.be/g8amyzDHOKw?t=37)  
- The radar can display your teammates and your current vision direction. It will also show if the vision is obscured by objects but not by the abilities(?) [smoke wall/bomb]. Also, on some parts of the video it is not showing up so I guess it can be disabled [Brimstone/Player with the sniper.. has it enabled but the rest of them don't?]  
- At [0:40](https://youtu.be/g8amyzDHOKw?t=40) Phoenix is capturing an ability point and gets his Ultimate unlocked [Yellow stripe shows up on the info bar mentioned above]. Is this unique to the specific map or what.. I only remember getting ability points on kills or after dying    
- At [1:35](https://youtu.be/g8amyzDHOKw?t=95) we can see the note about being spectated at top right. Kinda strange to see this is overwritten by kill-info  
- At [1:33](https://youtu.be/g8amyzDHOKw?t=93) we can see status effect ""DECAY"" that gradually lowers Brimstones HP but once he gets into contact with the toxic liquid over the ground it seems like he lost a flat amount of both Armor and HP over like ~2s that stacked(?) with the previous HP loss.. almost killing him. Once he left the cloud, he regained majority of HP and I assume that the missing 91/100 HP is due to the toxic liquid and not decay  
- There is a range indicator for distance between you and the body of a teammate who got killed. Not sure why exactly because body is already highlighted  
- There is a small multi-kill indicator on the kill-info, shows up as roman number III once Viper kills Jett  
- At [2:06](https://youtu.be/g8amyzDHOKw?t=126) status effect ""COMBAT STIM"" that was earlier deployed by Brimstone. There is also visual indicator on the sides of the screen [upwards moving arrows]  
- Important to notice - it seems that ""DECAY"" can not kill you as seen at the end of the video, [~2:06](https://youtu.be/g8amyzDHOKw?t=129). HP Reached 0 and there was a sound effect to indicate it?  
- To add to the above, it seems that these types of effects [Decay, Combat Stim] gradually fall off and that is shown by the indicator [that loading circle(?)] [At [2:10](https://youtu.be/g8amyzDHOKw?t=133) the player lost ""COMBAT STIM"" but instantly regain ""DECAY"" after entering Vipers ult  
- At [2:20](https://youtu.be/g8amyzDHOKw?t=140) we can see that dropped weapons have white glow/beam.. something like in Borderlands

[Phoenix Gameplay video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXluDCRqM-s)  
  
- As mentioned earlier, roman numbers to indicate kill streak [III and IV] appears on the kill status just besides the Agent icon  
- Announcer indicates ""One enemy remaining"" at [0:12](https://youtu.be/xXluDCRqM-s?t=12)  
- Announcer shouts ""CLUTCH"" as the round ends! There is also a visual representation of it.. with an effect of broken glass and writing ""CLUTCH' on the middle of screen. It can barely be seen at the end of the video

- At the same time you can see a tip for switching spectate on the bottom-left..  
- At [19:55](https://youtu.be/muFpmz-LVAk?t=1195) Sage gets health indicators underneath all of her teammates

VALORANT,2020,3,"I see a lot of questions asking if valorant is coming to console and with the available information, I don't think it will. So I put together a very budget PC build that can should be able to run valorant at 144+ fps. 

https://pcpartpicker.com/list/DDGpDx

some notes:

- prices are for readily available parts, you can certainly get them cheaper if you wait for sales/rebates etc. 

- no monitor, 1080p 144hz should cost an additional $120-$150 but I think you can find them at a cheaper price. I got my ASUS VG248QE several years ago for only $100 (used).

- only 8gb of ram but 8gb more can be added down the line. 

- I suggest getting a gtx 1060 6gb instead if you want to run other games at 144+ fps as well, as valorant has a low system requirements.

VALORANT,2020,3,"I would love to hear from the devs if they played the old cs 1.6 warcraft/heroes mods and if the devs were inspired by these mods.

Some of the warcraft modded servers were quite similar.

Typical Cs gameplay 5v5/10v10+ bomb + heroes you could chose with 3 abilitys and one ultimate.
On some servers you could buy or even upgrade those abilitys.
Even abilitys of some servers were very similar to Valorant abilitys.

Personally I love those modded servers and I think Valorant will be a huge sucess , Cs gameplay + abilitys offers great gameplay, if the abilitys are not to overpowered.",1583674879

VALORANT,2020,3,"&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/g197ni0chgl41.png?width=439&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ab91bd8b99c3dc8f2a59427cb6619616b172cb06

I think a lot of people are really overlooking a very significant factor with Jett's ultimate and its impact on the game's economy. I would not be surprised to see Jett being a ""must pick"" in competitive play for this reason alone: money.

For those of you who have not played or watched CSGO, when I say the economy, I mean your team's total money in-game. When a team chooses not to spend their money so that they can buy stronger weapons the next round, this is called an Eco-Round. It's a short term risk, long term reward situation, with the downside being that some or all of your players will have to suffer through a round with only pistols. Other times, you might funnel money into getting one player a very powerful item (such as an AWP), at the expense of others.

But then there's Jett. From the footage shown so far of Valorant's gameplay, and testimonials from playtesters, it seems as though you can expect to get your ultimate about once every 3-4 rounds or so. This means that in a 30 round match (standard CSGO competitive format), you could potentially get Jett's ultimate 10 times.

Every time you do, you're able to equip a weapon (her knives) for free which is comparable if not better than most of the top tier weapons in the game, killing on headshot and two-tapping on body, firing while moving without accuracy loss, and refilling on a kill. And because every time Jett gets her ultimate she doesn't need a weapon, she can either Eco or buy a weapon for her teammate without any consequences.

So just how much money is Jett's ultimate worth? The fire rate and damage are excellent, and the ability to throw knives while moving is impossible to put a pricetag on because it doesn't seem like that exists in any gun. For the sake of comparison, we'll say it's something like 3000, although this is even a bit of a lowball; if Jett's ultimate was in the store for anyone to buy, it could easily be priced much higher and players would still buy it.

So in conclusion, over the course of a 30 round game, Jett can potentially produce 30,000 credits with her ultimate, enough to buy almost 7 of Valorant's ""AWP."" On the low end.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: Jett prints money and will be mandatory in competitive just to bolster her team's economy way past their opponents.",1583676317

VALORANT,2020,3,"I have seen a lot of players starting to play CSGO in preparation of Valorant, so I figured I would compile some resources to help you learn the game. 

**BRAND NEW PLAYERS:**
If you have never played CSGO before, you should use the following resources to help understand fundamental mechanics, Valorant seems to be extremely similar in mechanics. I would watch as much War Owl as you can when you are learning, and when you think you have a decent grasp on the movement and other mechanics of CSGO you should move on to other resources. 

**TheWarOwl:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdPBKFV1840

War Owl has been a pillar in the CS community, and you will see people meme him because he makes content designed for brand new players, but the odds are most people you meet in CSGO probably learned how to play from his videos. Check out his videos on Crosshair placement, movement, spray control, etc. 

**LuckySkillFaker:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKNw7sLPNWQ&amp;list=PLfIyu2flKmBCTgQdmDH0fiZUaagB4rD0_&amp;index=1

He has a series in a playlist titled ""CS:GO Noob to Pro"" and I would recommend watching all of them to understand the game. 

**INTERMEDIATE GUDIES:**

**Voo:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gd5PCej5A8o

Voo has some very good content aimed at players who have basic mechanics down (Controls, how to move, etc.) and explains in more detail why you should do some things, and explains some mechanics that a brand new player might struggle with, but a player who has been playing longer might start to grasp. 

I don't know of any better intermediate level content creators than Voo, because most channels aim to hit beginners, or players playing at a competitive level and with a team. 

**EXPERT/ADVANCED GUIDES:**
This is the section I have most experience with, because I have been playing CSGO for 4 years now, and still watch these regularly, and try to learn new things to bring to my team. 

**Steel/Josh Nissan:** Notorious CSGO player, banned from Valve sanctioned events for throwing a match in 2015 with his team iBP(iBUYPOWER), but was unbanned in recent years from ESL events, Dreamhack, ECS, etc. Still playing competitively, and made some absolute bangers for people looking to start playing in a team and up their game. I'm going to compile a short list of videos I would recommend every CSGO player above DMG watch. 

Consistency: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YR2RF_WjwIk

IGL Series(Playlist): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eF7PWimNyjQ&amp;list=PLQcRYyog5iq4sETyxrA1TZcs59Vn5_M7-

I would recommend that before anybody decides to join or start a team to play competitively, you watch every video in that IGL series. 

Roles in CSGO: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=358vBMqdf54

Grenade management: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RIESVj6g0Ng

**Fallen:** IGL for MIBR, SK, Luminosity. Legendary IGL and AWPer, and father of Brazilian Counterstrike that will forever be a historic figure in the CSGO community. The video is quite long, but worth it if you want to start a team. 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdKq1j5L8AY

**Elmapuddy:** Absolute braniac analyst and current coach of Gen.G. Makes consistent bangers, every single video this guy has made is top tier, and highly informative. I can't recommend any one video, but if you want to seriously improve in your team, watch his channel. 

https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBKXQ-XSihIdD5Xh82F8MpA

**SPECIFIC HELP:**

There are a couple of pros who have made videos on specific subjects that I don't particularly think belong in any one category, so I'll just link them here. 

**Autimatic spray control:** 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9khWC8Asz8Y

**n0thing(various):**

VALORANT,2020,3,"I know a lot of people are complaining about the looks of the game, saying it looks ""too childish"" or ""like a game from 10 years ago"" or ""a mobile game"", and honestly I can see why, though I think the biggest change that would make the game look a lot better are shadows. It's fine that it's made with really low system requirements in mind for potato PCs so that more people can play and for better visibility but why not give the option to activate a few improvements if you so desire and your PC is strong enough.

Mainly, from what I've seen so far, characters don't have shadows, maybe they are just turned off in the demos but if they are not implemented at all, I think that's a mistake. Look [here](https://i.gyazo.com/bc400a63407453a7f875e789798a7270.png), I can't see character shadows in any of the gameplay videos so far, and that's what makes character on the map seem ""out of place"", shadows play a huge role in aesthetics and make thing blend in a lot better, hence many people say the characters/maps/themes and weapons don't really fit well with one another, I kinda agree with the weapons parts, would have preferred a more original/futuristic/fantastic design to them, but I guess the skins will fix that.

Also, lighting and reflection, I see there is not much dynamic lighting and no reflections anywhere, for example here with Phoenix using a fireball, no light changes on the ground or on the wall when casting or throwing [it](https://i.gyazo.com/01341c1a99802190bcba43bc130606e8.png) same as with shadows, some reflection of spells and more lighting play with the maps would help a ton, I noticed there is dynamic lighting on the weapons when you move, so why not have that across the entire game? 

Of course all those 3 options can be made with an ON/OFF toggle in the graphics settings for those that prefer a very minimalist look, but I prefer to max out the looks of the game as well as the frames per second, I can handle pretty much any recent game at 2k resolution and 144 FPS so I'm sure more people would like to have the options. :D",1583709858

VALORANT,2020,3,"I get that there are people here that are either big fans of Riot for their past game(s) or because they're genuinely convinced from everything they're seeing that the game will be good. I know when you guys see the gameplay being railed on, you go out of your way to defend Riot because of one reason or another. You don't need to defend Riot, it's part of the job they signed up for to get feedback in the form of ridicule or hype. Everyone is entitled to an opinion, and if people dislike the footage shown because of one reason or another, you don't need to go out of your way to defend it, that's their opinion and leave it at that. Let the game speak for itself on release, then we will know exactly how good or bad it is. What if a criticism you were defending from the footage remains in the final release? Now, if someone is going out of their way to spread lies, then that's another thing, you can clarify those lies, however, I think it's best to restrain ourselves from going above and beyond to die on a hill for a game that isn't even out yet. 

The way that I see it is that with all of this hype, and with everyone convincing themselves and everyone they speak to that ""the game will be fine, it will be the next big thing"", it's just setting up everyone for disappointment, no matter how good the product is, living up to the hype built up over the last month or so is impossible for any game imo. So I think we just need to dial is down, stop defending Riot, stop saying things we don't know like ""x and y will be fixed or implemented on release for sure"" so that when the game is actually out, it's not going to be ripped a new one by everyone whose expectations were sky high from all the hype built up by the community, I've seen it time and time again and don't want this to be another in the list, although I frankly doubt my single post on an obscure subreddit in the corner of the internet will do any good.",1583751341

VALORANT,2020,3,"Just thought I'd post this cause none of the gameplay analysis videos I've seen mention it -- there is a recharge mechanic for Jett's dash and Phoenix's molotov thing.

In the Round defense video, Jett uses her dash to get to the action. When she gets the first kill, you see one of the two circled X icons above the dash ability get activated. She gets the second, the second x activates, and the game says signature ability activated. So by getting 2 kills, Jett can get her dash back. However you have to have used it already for this to count -- in the Round offense video, this Jett gets the first pistol headshot of the round. But you don't see the X get activated, indicating you have to have the ability unavailable for the kills to count towards a recharge.

In the Phoenix video, you see these two X's above his molotov ability too, implying it works the same way.

In terms of other characters, we see a lack of these X's for Viper, Sova, Brimstone, and Sage. So we know they don't have the kill recharge. Viper's wall can be reactivated once laid down if she has fuel, Sova's sonar and Sage's heal recharge on time, I don't think we know if Brimstone's smoke recharges (could be wrong though). The ability description for Cypher says his camera recharges when picked up or destroyed. We don't know anything regarding this about Omen, if I had to wager though I'd guess it was a kill-recharge for his shadow thing.",1583802767

VALORANT,2020,3,"This week I released a video, which I also posted on Reddit, regarding progression in Valorant. My friend who I work with on the channel, Sven, reported that at the Riot offices he got told about and saw URF/NERF skins.

Riot has contacted me since and says that they are not planning to bring URF or any League of Legends affiliated items to Valorant. They want to make clear that Valorant will have no ties with League of Legends whatsoever. 

With that being said, the play on words was the wrong part. The game WILL get NERF skins for their guns, but they won't be inspired by URF.

This was a mistake by my part and I apologize for spreading this. Either Sven and I made a misconception at the event, or Riot decided to not implement the skins at a later date. Either way, I misinformed you a bit, for which I am sorry. I will also post this update in the next video on my channel, so everyone on YouTube is aware of the NERF skins, and be sure to make a pinned comment on the current video.

VALORANT,2020,3,"The dev console on Counter Strike, while rudimentary it is extremely useful and it, as well as community modding/the workshop, provides most of the content that can be created. 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The dev console is very useful for training and fun games with friends. I definitely don’t want a copy of what CS has, instead something a little more refined to experiment with the game. The only game I’ve played more than CS is Overwatch, and burnout was one of the reasons I quit (I left before workshop was I thing). I think something that has helped me stay with CS is being able to mess around in customs. 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Modding is something both games have done well. I did quit Overwatch before the workshop came out but it seems to have a very positive effect on the community.  I really hope this is something VALORANT can learn as it has worked out tremendously with other games. 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The final thing I’d like to address is community map submissions/the workshop. Here I really want to reiterate that they should not copy CS outright. I really want community maps and skins to be a part of the game but CS has flaws. First off I believe that while devs should have veto power, skins should be completely community decided if there are enough submissions(also I’m aware that in f2p it is inevitable that skins cost money but please be more like apex where you can buy skins with in-game currency and cases don’t cost money to open). Maps are more complex and shouldn’t be as community controlled if they are makable at all. I really hope that map submissions are a thing, but they do require a hardcore audience and complex tools so doesn’t really make sense as a day one feature.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
TL;DR
Riot should learn from the ways valve and Blizzard have enabled their communities, but not copy them.

EDIT: All of this is pure wishful thinking in my part and has allegedly been confirmed by devs to not be happening whatsoever.",1583885410

VALORANT,2020,3,"This week I have seen this debated multiple times on this sub. I have seen native players say things along the lines of “I hate that changing res stuff” etc. 

Riot Games have released their statement regarding 30 fps minimum for low end pcs. Anybody who has played a competitive shooter at an even relatively high level will know that 30 fps is quite literally unplayable and will drastically reduce your ability to hit shots and react quickly. IMHO playing on anything under 200 fps puts you at a decent disadvantage to players with higher fps.

As somebody who did not have a high end computer for a long time, by lowering my CSGO res to 1024 x 768, I was able to to go from about 30-70 fps to 130-170 fps on average. This singular feature allowed me to to compete with players with much higher spec pcs than me, and allowed me to go from silver to LE.

I believe Riot’s idea of disallowing stretched res is actually done with competitive integrity in mind. 

Unfortunately, they may end up doing the opposite.
A vast majority of the player base is not going to have 144hz/240hz monitors OR high end pcs, also the majority of new players are not going to use black bars. Because of this, I believe allowing players to play on all resolutions including stretched will actually to some degree level the playing field. 

If you don’t like changing your res, 1920 x 1080 is ALWAYS going to be a part of the game. Players who do like playing on stretched res should be given the option to play on the settings most comfortable to them. CSGO and R6 are both highly competitive at the pro level and both have unlocked res.

In order for Valorant to do well as a game, and as an Esport, Riot are going to have to win over a decent chunk of the CS, R6 and Fortnite playerbase. I believe allowing all resolutions can only increase their chances of doing that successfully.

VALORANT,2020,3,"Hey everyone!

I'm developing a little and humble moviemaking / visual content community for valorant, and I'm looking for content creators and youtubers, even people that will stream the game can join us. The main idea of the website is to promote videos and streams (also it's creators) and doing moviemaking stuff too (edits, clips, basics), as soon as riot makes it possible. We will give the necessary tools to start into the world of moviemaking and editing for valorant.

Yes, I know it's very early to search for content creators if we don't even have a beta for the game - but there are people already preparing its channels for valorant, so firsts will come first!

A bit of a deeper explanation about the site:

1. People will send videos in its simpliest format: a link to a YouTube video will be enough, Twitch streams will also be accepted.
2. We will promote in the website making a self post for it and giving our point of view of what we saw.
3. Guests will be able to watch through website (video posts), giving it's creator the youtube views, and being able to rate and comment videos too inside our site.
4. Videos with the most rating will be highlighted in the main page for a couple days, until another video goes popular and overlays the last one.

It will kinda works like warcraftmovies worked on its days.

I'll give you twitter and site link (still in beta), hope is not too much spam (or dont consider as if it was, at least :P):  [https://twitter.com/ValorantMovies](https://twitter.com/ValorantMovies) / [www.valorantmovies.com](https://www.valorantmovies.com)

Maybe we can gather all information that is currently available here and someone can turn it into a pretty list to keep updated over the following months.

Off the top of my head:

Game is mechanically mostly based on cs:go.

It's a 5v5 tactical shooter in a best of 24 (first to 13) where one team defends / defuses the ""spike"" and one team attacks / plants the ""spike"".

I'm not even sure on the number of agents revealed yet but they're the playable characters that are unique within each team(not sure on this!), unswappable during a match and come with more or less unique abilities that are similar to utility in cs:go but also go beyond them as there are far more abilities / agents than utility grenades in cs:go that cover many more functionalities in total. 
Every agent has the same defensive and offensive capabilities besides their abilities, coming with 100 health and the same itemshop for each round (guns and 25/50 shield).

Anyone with anything to correct and/or add is very much invited to do so. Any and all data posted here is posted (to be replicated) to be shared with others.",1584003139

Some people say that it gives an ""unfair advantage"" by making player models look bigger. But it comes at a cost of lowered FOV and faster moving target.

It doesn't make the game drastically easier. There are so many top tier pros who doesn't use stretched res and have insane aim like Ropz ( [So good that people accused him for aimbotting](https://youtu.be/jB1G4jEWK7o) ), Shroud etc.

All the good and competitive FPS Esports had it for years without any problems. And if Riot is targeting the CS:GO player base then they should consider adding stretched, Since [Valve is planning some big stuffs for CS:GO as well](https://twitter.com/Slasher/status/1233774847290957824?s=19)",1584005149

Putting characters behind a paywall seems strange in a game that looks to be focused on strategy and counterplay. Regardless of price and time to grind to unlock the characters, most people might get turned off of a game if they see a character they want to play locked right when they start the game up for the first time. If Riot is aiming for the fanbase of games with only paid cosmetics then putting essential characters that impact the game directly seems like a bad idea. This is all coming from a person who has been and is still looking forward to the game, just voicing my concerns as a fan.",1584065295

VALORANT,2020,3,"Contrary to what most think, I think that next week will be the final character teaser trailer. What's my reasoning? It's simple, of all the characters announced so far, we've only gotten 3 ""official"" character renders, these being for Phoenix, Viper and Jett (these are the fancy art of them we see at the beginning of their teaser videos). These artworks were initially released around the time the information embargo for the game was released and so far there seem to be no signs of any more artworks of these kinds in the near future. Now we take that information, line up the expected release date for the next teaser and then correlate that the date we get is approximately 3 weeks from the release of the embargo, which lo and behold is the ""leaked"" date for the beta by the Sentinels. That's my theory, not foolproof, but I think it's highly likely based on the available information.

Edit: For clarification, I don't think the beta will necessarily start next week Thursday/Friday, however, I do think that info on it will be announced around that time and a beta for it started soon after. The beta will, of course, prioritize streamers and influencers as the event was cancelled, also this would explain why the Sentinels would be privy to this information, but I do think it will likely be a closed beta, inviting those that signed up early and, if they do the same system as they did with LoR, access granted to viewers of streamers with Riot accounts. Now the reason I believe this is two-fold.

1. Because when Slasher originally leaked info about the influencer event etc, he stated that there would be a beta in a couple of weeks, this was prior to the cancellation announcement, so clearly there were already plans for a closed beta of some sorts, we also know that there would be a closed beta first, based on the subscription prompt on the Valorant website.
2. If they only grant access to streamers and influencers, this would limit the MM pool so queue times would be much higher than normal. In a coordinated setting, aka the hands-on event, they were planning, this could be alleviated, however coordinating this via online lobbies/discord servers would be harder and a lot of time would be wasted in just setting up a single match when they want to spend most of that time actually showcasing the game.
3. *Conspiracy theorist point: Coronavirus, more people inside to watch the game and streamers play.*",1584101937

Created by: River66#5954

**Viper**

Viper, an only child named Sarah from the United states. She always looked up to her dad who worked at a chemical company. One time Sarah was going with her father to work for a day because she always admired what her father did. Sarah loved chemistry. So they were on a boat which had the goal to drop chemical waste in the ocean. At a certain moment Sarah decided to play hide &amp; seek with her dad. He struggles but he’s on he’s break so what can it hurt? While her dad is counting, Sarah seeks the perfect hiding spot so her dad will never find her. She sees this container with smaller containment boxes with “Dangerous Chemical” warning signs on them. Sarah was young and thought nothing of it. What Sarah didn’t realize was that she was in a container that was about to be dropped into the ocean. So she goes into the container and after 2 minutes of hiding the door fully closes and gets locked. Sarah is scared now and wants to leave but can’t. She’s banging as hard as she can on the doors but no one hears her. The container gets right above the ocean and then drops. Sarah is drowning and she is in contact with all kinds of highly dangerous chemicals. The container drops down to the seafloor and because of that the container door slams opens. After 10 minutes her dad is starting to get suspicious and is shouting around the whole deck looking for he’s daughter but with no response. While in great panic, he thinks that he’s little girl might be in the container that dropped into the ocean. The container gets pulled up but no evidence of her body. Sarah’s entire body got filled with so many chemicals no human should ever have to experience. She’s burning, choking and enduring pain that is unbearable. Eventually she passed out. When she wakes up,  her body is merged with the chemicals and her brain is filled with rage. Her rage is set on the people that made her become this, that made her endure all this pain and suffering. She goes on the hunt for the people from the chemical company to find and kill every single last one of them, starting with the person who made the container drop. She finds him and goes after him. When she finds him, she makes him drop onto he’s floor in he’s living room.  He’s laying on the floor begging for mercy but Sarah doesn’t listen. The rage in her head, that VOICE in her head, is telling her, kill him. And she does it without mercy. A ruthless kill which changed her life, forever. Sarah is no longer Sarah, Sarah has jsut become: Viper.",1584121145

Created by: C4RTER-#0850

**Pheonix**

   
Phoenix, born in Brixton, had always wanted to sign up to the army. This was common for the younger lads of their generation. Growing up his friends realised joining the armed forces wasn't as exciting as they once thought however Phoenix still had his mind set. When the time finally came to enroll, Phoenix stood in line with the same excited feeling he had as a child. Time passed and the new recruits were getting settled into their new way of life. Unfortunately for Phoenix he had struggled to fit in since the beginning. The other recruits would bully him as he had difficulty running the drills and was dragging the team down. One night outside of camp the team were relaxing by a bonfire. Phoenix wasn’t invited as usual but he decided for a change he would try to join in with the fun. He walked down the path towards the blazing inferno that the men stood around. Once he got close, the other men started to tease him and laugh because he had turned up. One thing led to another and an argument broke out between phoenix and the alpha of the pack. Phoenix felt so tired of the bullying that he received and threw a punch. Unfortunately for him it was easily dodged and the man pushed him back. Phoenix tripped. Before he knew it he was submerged in flames. The men gasped however there was no noise coming from the fire. They expected at least some screaming. Phoenix felt a feeling rush through his body he had never felt before. He felt a burning but strangely for him it wasn't painful. He quickly jumped up from the fire and out of instinct pushed his hand out towards his attacker. To everyone's surprise a ball of fire was shot from his hands.",1584121345

Pc already has so many alternatives, and literally the only thing this game has going for it there is that it is made by Riot. This game is literally made for console. People will ignore its bad graphics due to it being ftp (and being on console), whereas ftp games on pc have a higher standard due to specs.

As well, it would be the only triple A console game that plays like Cs. That is what I though the selling point was supposed to be, that it was counterstrike on console, but now that I know it will not be releasing on console... well it is going to be dead before it starts. 

Yes, it may have a large player base at launch (but still small compared to other releases that launch on console), but it is simply not unique enough to make it on pc alone. I am genuinely astounded that they are not releasing this for console, it is literally a game made for console. And mark my words, if it doesn’t launch on console it will fail. 

It may not die completely, simply due to who is making it, and the endless stream of cash they will throw at it, but I guarantee it will underperform, and will be all but dead this time next year.",1584316968

VALORANT,2020,3,"First of all, lets get this out of the way: I am really hyped for Valorant. The only game that ever where able to draw me in for serveral years were League, and if there would ever be another game to do the same, I could imagine Valorant being that.

However, I am curious to see how well the different design of the Agents stand out in a match. I like what has been leaked so far with the 8 agents, but comparing it to the character design of League, it is clear that they are going for some more realistic/understated characters. 

It made me think about the first time I encountered League. February 2011, I saw one of my friends play the game, and I was instantly intrigued. Just from watching him play, I was able to tell the characters apart, and have a nice understanding of what their abilities where. The graphics where of course simpler than they are today, but for me the character design made each character stand out.

I wonder how well we will be able to recognise Valorant Agents in the heat of battle. From the limited gameplay that has been presented, I was having a hard time destinquishing one character from another. Of course most of that is from a lack of actually playing the game, but still, just from watching that first game of League, I felt more connected to the characters there, than I am with the Valorant agents.

Taking examples from Apex Legends, I think that each of the base eight characters that was available at release was quite distinquishable from another. Where in valorant, for me at least, the agents seem less recognisable from each other. 

On the other hand, this might be a clever design choice on Riots side. The market is oversaturated with hero shooters, where some of the general character designs repeat themselves (Overwatch, Paladins, etc.) Maybe by making their characters less flashy, they actually manage to create an unique vibe for the game?

Or hey! Maybe it is just to give us a real good incentive for spending those $$$ on cosmetics ;)

Would love to hear someone elses thoughts on this:

1. Do you like the Agent Designs, and why/why not?
2. Do you think it is a deliberate design choice to have the characters look simpler than League/Overwatch/Apex characters?
3. Which of the Agents do you think have the most recognisable design?",1584363450

VALORANT,2020,3,"Its obvious that RIOT is aiming to be direct competition to CSGO and 90% of CSGO players play on 4:3 stretched resolutions. When I don't see why wouldn't they support 4:3 it would be an even bigger reason for CSGO players to try the game and maybe swap. Not having 4:3 support and abilities in CSGO like game, is a big turnoff of CSGO players. So in my mind I can't see a good reason why there wouldn't be 4:3 support in VALORANT. They want to steal CSGO playerbase they need 4:3 support or ability to stretch it via config files like in most modern games that don't support 4:3.",1584376867

&gt; I wonder how much pubg will fall off once Valorant gets released. I think Valorant will be crazy popular in Korea

Because League is so popular in Korea, many people think that Valorant will be very popular in Korean, but not in reality. In Asia and especially in Korea,Valorant faces big criticism. Asian users value visuals more than you think.

Despite having low quality graphics, Crossfire and Sudden Attack were popular because they were released in 2006. Recently, games released in China and Korea have invested heavily in graphic quality. PUBG is a great success in Korea and China, and the specification isn't low. Every PC Bang has spec computers that can play PUBG.

This is a comment by Koreans about Valorant.

Knives such as the Luxe Knife have no extra animation at all, and most of the others share the same one (like Ruin, Elderflame and others). An equip at least like the bayonets in CSGO would even work tbh, it just feels too stale for a knife I paid so much VP for.

Also while I'm at it, do you think a tag on dropped weapons like ""XXX's Elderflame Vandal"" would be nice? (like in csgo)

Edit: small correction

Edit 2: I feel like this needs a bit of clarification, I use CSGO as a reference to better explain myself and help you guys better visualize what I'm trying to say. By no means am I trying to compare the two games.

Edit 3: Just some final remarks before the post dies off: My main motivation for creating this post was to point out the clunkiness with the animations. I'm not saying the game needs over the top unique animations for the knives, just a small *pop* when you switch to the knife or inspect it, so it feels better when you Q-Q or spam inspect for fun.

VALORANT,2021,1,"&amp;#x200B;

I have been playing valorant for a while now. The highest was bronze and the lowest iron. 

There are so many bots in Valorant that it just is unplayable anymore. I get it if people are bad, if they feed, if they leave the game or disconnect for whatever reason. 

But Riot should not allow people to use bots and afk. They should just get banned straight away. This person is a bot that just crouches and moves forward and shoots. So riot's system doesn't think that he is afk.

This means riot still thinks he is playing the game. (I have recorded a video of this in the link down below if you want to see what I mean).

Because riots system cant detect them as afk, We can't surrender and they spawn every round. We don't get extra money or ulti orb. So we are basically taken hostage. Some people just leave then. And the only other thing to do is just sit there and wait till the enemy comes and kill you over and over again.

This is a low bronze, high bronze game. I dont know if this happens in higher ranks or not. But this is unplayable.

I dont know why riot is not doing anything about this. I don't think it should be hard to identify these bots because of their behavior. They are using a macro doing the same thing over and over again. In this instance, it is crouching and shooting constantly.

&amp;#x200B;

This is also a name and shame. I know Riot has a report system. But it just doesn't seem to work. Just ban people straight away if they are using bots or macros.

VALORANT,2021,1,"Hi, I am just wondering something quick. I have been playing this game really regularly ever since July-August. I started out Iron 3. I am currently g2. Even though I know that I'll get better the longer I play (for example, I may get diamond in like march or something), I just feel like so many others are progressing faster. For example, I see people who have only played this game for 3 months and they have gotten to plat-diamond with no previous fps experience. High elo players, how long did it take for you guys to get to where you are? (if you're a previous overwatch/cs player, how long did it take for you to get good too?) How much effort did it take? What helped you a lot?",1609469609
VALORANT,2021,1,"I've noticed recently that I seem to misjudge animations and I can't tell if it's just me needing to get the timing down, or if they're actually sloppy on the server-side. 

So for example a situation that will happen frequently enough for me to notice it is this:

I come around a corner or something and I see an enemy player in the middle of the pulling-out-the-gun animation, you know where they cock the gun before being able to fire it. When I see this, I usually try to line up my shot a little better rather than just shooting. And as I line up my shot, I get headshotted. It seems like their gun just snaps into place without the animation finishing. So while I thought I had an extra half second or so, I just get killed. 

I know the root problem is that my aim isn't good enough for me to make those shots faster, and I'll be the first to say that I'm not good at this game and I have a lot to learn and practice, but I'm curious if anyone else has noticed/perceived this. Is this real? Or am I just misjudging the speed of the animation?

I'm sure ping has something to do with this, but I usually get \~45ms ping when I'm playing, and I can't imagine it's normal at that ping.",1609469678

VALORANT,2021,1," Role:Classified Agent Wildcard Ultimate: Ultimate gives any agent's ultimate in the game. Using ult will trigger a menu asking the player which agent's ultimate to use. Wildcards signature: Player can copy any other player's alternative abilities disregarding their signature ability. He has two cards every match and he can recharge and get only one more card in the same match by getting three kills, this can be changed. Ex: Cannot use pheonix's hot hands. The player can only take one of each ability Ex: If Wildcard throws a card on Jett's body, he can only take updraft or cloudburst, but he will not receive three cloud bursts only one, and he cannot use his second card on the same agent. This is done by throwing a card on an enemies body (similar to cypher's ultimate) or just throwing it on a teamate within a certain vicinity. The player after using the signature will receive that specified agent's side abilities like jetts cloudburst and updraft but wild card will not receive the agent's signature.

I know that the duelists might be having a bad day but they are only there for one game and that one game makes all the difference for the supports rank.  This is in a example of supports gaining less then duelists in a win because they cant frag out and losing a lot more because they were lower in the leaderboard in terms of kills. Even though they have the utility that helps their team.  So for all you support mains out there thank you for your support (pun?)

VALORANT,2021,1,"Valorant is not an ""aim heavy"" game but that doesn't mean aim training is useless.

I've seen a lot of misinformation and pseudo science on the topic so I wanted to give some real information that everyone can find useful, and help you improve at valorant.

1-Muscle memory is not what you are training for. 

Muscle memory(as it's commonly described) is of no use while aiming. When aim training you are training for mouse control. The way muscle memory applies is in technique, similar to what martial artist do, instead of training to do a specific, rigid movement you want a guideline on how to move your mouse while being precise, smooth, etc.

2-Aim labs is not an actual aim trainer. 

Aim labs is a data collection tool, lacs scenarios and the scenarios it does have lack versatility and can be found on other aim trainers. 

 If you are serious on imroving your aim, Koovaks and Aimbeast are the aim trainer you should be using. Koovaks specifically has countless scenarios, a massive community, tons of tools and routines for improving on a specific game, issue, of fundamental and most coaches like Aimer7 focus on koovaks.

Communities like Voltaic have great resources, routines, benchmarks and tools(like a sens randomizer and raw accel driver)

3-Mouse acceleration and multiple sensitivities

Mouse acceleration isn't horrible, but some types of mouse accel are. The most well known are windows pointer precision, logitechs own mouse accel, in game, etc. This are all bad, windows pointer precision accelerates at random intervals, making it unreliable, hard to practice, etc. There are other mouse accel drivers like [this one](https://github.com/a1xd/rawaccel) which can be fine tuned to your liking, although it may interrupt with vanguard so keep that in mind.

Training on multiple senstivities can be extremely useful, this stimulates the part of your brain to adapt and learn and what not ([read](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14zwQOFlQPsdli_rRz4EftlMYbiSfK6IzyjHwVus87Zk/edit)). Using a sens randomizer like [this one](https://github.com/Whisperrr/SensitivityRandomizer) can be extremely usefull and make your aim training more efficient.

That's basically it.",1609492272

VALORANT,2021,1,"I recently watched a video on youtube, a creator named [eggwick](https://www.youtube.com/c/eggwick/videos) had uploaded, where his girlfriend who had just started playing FPS titles, went through the Valorant tutorial and had her first match ([https://youtu.be/KgS3CyQvSAQ](https://youtu.be/KgS3CyQvSAQ))

The noobishness ( forgive me all ) present was quite comedic and innocent if I'm being honest. However, I drew many parallels from that video with my own experience.

Valorant is my first FPS title and the first game I've ever been serious about. When I started I knew nothing about aiming, the various map, or even the agents. Luckily for me, the minimap was something I picked quite easily and youtube tutorial videos helped me out a lot.

I remember my first game quite vividly, I was playing phoenix (an agent I knew nothing about and picked based off visual appeal) on split and we kept on hitting the A site. Luckily we had a viper who knew what she was doing and carried the team, however when I think about my actions that day, II can't help but cringe, I didn't manage my economy (kept buying pistols every round lol), kept flashing my teammate, kept running about aimlessly and didn't know how to chat or even ping!

The only good thing I did was wall off cross ( because I saw viper do it :D).

However, I fell into the well of toxicity and got angry when i saw other people doing what I was once guilty of. A match stands out to me in particular, I believe I was playing phoenix on split (De Ja Vu lol ) with a cypher and a Sova (other two were AFK) and the Sova was clearly a young boy (could tell by his voice) and was doing exactly what i and eggwick's girlfriend did in our first games.

At some point, I got mad and began shouting, however, the cypher stepped in and made me see the situation more clearly (Thank God), we all began to talk and had a great experience ( don't even remember if we won or lost :D ).

I re-queued with them and I'm happy to say, that was one of my best days in-game. The Sova hasn't really been online much recently which makes me wonder if he just dropped it. I nearly did the same thing again recently but another cypher stopped me ( Guardian angel) and I remember one with a great sage who was clearly dealing with self-esteem issues ( Thank God My Toxic Days were behind me at this point)

&amp;#x200B;

I'm sure we are all guilty of this in some form or the other and I'm not here to throw shade, all I'm saying is - Let's not harm peoples self-esteem from the way they are treated in-game and ultimately pursue people from the game because what might be common knowledge to some might not be to everyone (Who knew knife walking was faster? lol).

&amp;#x200B;

An Example of this is Fortnite, a game I haven't played but genuinely seems great however the only complaint seems to be a toxic player base.

And so with this, I hope our community become a little bit more welcoming.

&amp;#x200B;

PS: You really should watch the video [https://youtu.be/KgS3CyQvSAQ](https://youtu.be/KgS3CyQvSAQ)

PPS: Am I the only one who thinks ploo queues with toxic people? [https://youtu.be/QfFdfQtSt0I](https://youtu.be/QfFdfQtSt0I)",1609506672

Us plebs stuck in plat/diamond, that solo q is literally impossible to get out. Here an example: I just finished a game team MVP with Reyna on split lost 13-4. We started in attack and after the first pistol I go: ""yo boys don't rush lets play it slow"" And what do they do? Push like there is no tomorrow. Mind you, they did this every round on attack so yeah.. Eventually we finished first half 9-3 for the defenders. In defence we also lost the pistol, because once one guy died in one site either A or B, my team mates would rotate instant. And that leaves on site open and mid open.. The attackers didn't even enter once on site for the plant, no, they just faked one site so these plebs would rotate instant and leave mid and the other site open, and so they would flank from mid and kill everyone.. In the end we won 1 more round to end in 13-4.. Tell me Solo Q is possible c'mon I'm waiting for your argumets :D",1609510076

So I deranked from plat 1. Actually from plat 3 because afkers and trolls, but that's another topic. I deranked from plat 1 and lost those 3a (a for arrows). Then I go Match MVP with 3a. Still Gold 3. Ok, fair. Team MVP, 2a down. Match MVP, 2a up. TMVP 2a down. TMVP 2a up. MMVP 2a up.

&amp;#x200B;

So let's assume that from one rank to another it's from 0 to 10 arrows. After you surpass 10, you rank up. After you go down from 0 you rank down. It is something like this, im just gonna use arrows here to simpler math and its what we have to use so.

Worst part is to assume that you fo down from 10 to 8 when you derank. I'm assuming the game is forgiving and gives you a chance to rank back up when you play a very good game and get 3 arrows after that sour lost from the derank. Which has happened to me a few times. Everytime I derank and play a game with 3 arrows up after that lost, I rank back up again. Simple math:

&amp;#x200B;

So, 8-3+3=8. 8-2+2=8. 8-2+2+2=10

Ok, I need 1 more arrow to move up. But now add to that equation that this player was Match MMVP and TMVP every single game. In a row. It doesn't matter? I think it should. There should be a reward here for this. Maybe add 0.25 more ""arrows"" when you get to be Team MVP and maybe 0.5 arrows more when you get to be Match MVP. Win or lose, that should be added. It should reward those players who pushed up and tried their best, and actually got to be the best (at least by the system, which is what moves you up or down), to win those games.

Instead of losing 1 / 2 / 3 arrows, you would be losing 0.75 / 1.75 / 2.75 or 0.5 / 1.5 / 2.5

Instead of winning 1 / 2 / 3 arrows, you would be winning 1.25 / 2.25 / 3.25 or 1.5 / 2.5 / 3.5

To me, it's unfair that being Match or Team MVP counts for nothing. I did The math and I'm still Gold 3. I'm not being rewarded to being the best on my team or on the match. Not even when I'm that for 6 matches in a row. Not even when I'm solo queue.

&amp;#x200B;

Conclusion: Being Match MVP or Team MVP doesn't matter.

&amp;#x200B;

P.S.: After the 3a lost i played vs gold 1, gold 2 and silver 3 in the next match with the 3a up. The i played with plat 3, 2 and 1 on the next match wih the 2a down. Then I don't remember, but mostly a mix of plat and gold.",1609515434

VALORANT,2021,1,"After seeing a post about Koreans in high elo think that shotguns (mainly the bucky) are too strong on r/VALORANT a couple months ago, I did an experiment to see if I could climb with shotgun only. Instead of picking the best movement type agents that synergize well with shotguns (Raze and Jett), I picked Sage since I was thinking I could use her wall aggressively to get off-angles against opponents. Also the name Shotgun Sage was funny to me.

I found out that Shotguns are really good, especially if you can master the bucky right click range. The amount of times I was able to get a one-shot was too many.

Utilizing shotguns definitely alter the style of play that most people are not used to and can surprise enemies.

Also Killing people with shotguns make people very angry which you can see some examples here: [Video 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wn6Yy6zSQeY) &amp; [Video 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91kcKDG3wXo&amp;t)

&amp;#x200B;

Below is what I found playing as Shotgun Sage ([Montage of how I hit diamond](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tCwYzNWf04))

**Requirements:**

* Play Sage every game
* Only use Shotguns: Judge, Bucky, and Shorty
* With round loss providing 1900 credits, I am able to force-buy every single round.
* I mainly played with my friends (duo to 5-stack) since I didn't want to ruin any random teammate's games, however when I did solo queue, all my teammates were super nice and loved the fact I was going as Shotgun Sage.

&amp;#x200B;

**Analysis**

* I went 4-1 in my placements and got the rank of Silver 3 (For unrated games, I only lost once before I reached 10 wins).
* It took 53 games from Silver 3 to reach Diamond 1. I had a 73.5% W/L Ratio, 39 Wins - 14 Losses.
* I have a K/D of 1.39, Dmg/Round = 148, HS% = 17.5%, Combat Score of 266, Econ Score of 56
* On Defense, I mainly used the Judge. On Offense, I used Bucky only since the right click has farther range.
* Going shotgun only, I am able to store up my economy and constantly buy for my teammates.
* Even in high plat/low diamond, opponents did not know how to adapt shotguns. People got super tilted and would claim that shotguns are no skill, then start to use them, get killed, rage more, then go back to assault rifles.
* I also had weird experiences with the shorty - I shoot them with 2 shots and hit them with 11 pellets but only did 77 damage. I learned that with the shorty, you have to be almost kissing your opponent for it to kill them, once you start social distancing the shorty damage falls off drastically.
* On pistol rounds, I always went with Wall+Shorty. This leaves me with 300 credits which will allow me to always buy a wall the next round (win or lose).
* My playstyle changed, I learned how to fast-jiggle peek and shoot with the bucky. On defense, I always changed where my location and set-up.
* I found some spots where I can wall up which will allow me to get the perfect bucky-right click oneshot range.

&amp;#x200B;

**Tips on how to counter Shotguns**

* Use your utility: the toughest agents were Sova, Cypher, Breach, Phoenix, and Raze. They are able to clear out corners where someone with a shotgun would hide. Also flashes counter shotgun play super hard.
* Play at a distance, if you know the optimal shotgun right click range, you will also know how far back to stand or if you need to play up close. There are many times where I would right click and it would only do 20 damage since the pellets didn't travel far enough.
* Play smart: the best example I can give is on the map Split. If someone is using a shotgun, they usually play in Mail Room (B-Heaven), therefore you can execute A and they will have a hard time retaking site.

I think that shotguns are very strong especially in force-buying rounds and the round after pistol. I honestly have no idea on how to nerf the bucky right click.",1609535751

VALORANT,2021,1,"Hi guys, last week I started to play Valorant again, I played beta, act 1 and I totally skipped act 2.

I peeked immortal 1 in act 1 and now (act 3) I've hit diamond 2 with ease and no pressure at all.

&amp;#x200B;

My problem is that the higher rank I get the more I'm scared of being judged by my teammates for not playing good enough.

This is how my brain works during some high rank games: ""holy sh\*t my Reyna is immortal 3, omg they're all immortal I cannot fk this up"".

I keep pressing tab to check the scoreboard and it's all ok as long as I get a decent amount of frags but my mentality goes from 100 to 0 in a split second if I press tab and I see myself at the bottom of the scoreboard.

It gets worse if any of my teammates makes the slightest comment about my performance during the game, I start to play horribly and I can't wait for the game to end so I can take a break.

It's important to say that I play to improve, not to win that single game, I really want to improve at the game but sometimes anxiety hits so hard I can't keep on playing.

I played on a couple of smurf accounts and the same happens, I reach diamond 2-3 very easy but then I start to get the feeling that all the other players are better than me and I don't want to be judged by them at any cost.

I'd also like to say that this only happens in Valorant: I've been playing league for like 10 years now, no such problems whatsoever; played csgo for over 1000 hours and never experienced anything like that.

&amp;#x200B;

Can anyone give me some tips to overcome this kind of anxiety?

VALORANT,2021,1,"There is a thing in this game where if you run and shoot your gun at the same time, the gun’s bullet spread becomes absolutely horrible and it is basically impossible to aim your gun.

TL DR: Do not use w a s d, or space bar while shooting your gun, because your accuracy becomes bad",1609537396

People need the opportunity to build a team composition without locking in. Right now there is no incentive to talk to your team and develop a team comp because if you don't instalock your main there is a low probability you will get to play a character you enjoy. 

Now you could just learn more characters, 

But, if we remove the ability for two people to have the same character up for lock at the same time, those two people can talk about who should go what roll and who should stick with their first pick.",1609540643

VALORANT,2021,1,"Introduction: Aisha is an Indian character. She can be classified as a sentinel, but has initiator aspects to her kit as well. 

Abilities:
Note: keep in mind the numbers are just temp they don’t matter as much as the ability description. Also the names are also the best I could come up with atm.

E (Signature Ability): Akashic One - Aisha equips an Akashic One Anti-Personnel Device, which can be invisibly deployed onto a wall (including objects), thrown on the ground, or equipped on an ally (includes herself). If equipped on an Ally, it mounts itself to the ground near when the ally is dead. An unused Akashic One can be picked up and redeployed instantly, while using 2 abilities on the same device consumes its radianite. (3-4 charges, one per round and 200 gold each for the rest), no recharge. 

C :  Scan/Disrupt - Can be cast instantly on a device. If the selected Akashic One is deployed on a surface (wall, object or ground), it reveals itself while instantly scanning the area and picking up radiant signals in the detection radius, and self destructs in 2 seconds, dealing 50-70 damage in a small radius. (To clarify, it reveals which agents are in the detection radius but not their positions, and it insta ticks just once so you can’t stop it from scanning, but you can shoot and stop it from dealing damage). If the targeted device is instead equipped on an ally, the device partially disrupts radianite, causing it to deal 20% less damage. (20% less damage taken from abilities but also 20% less dealt). 2 charges, 100 gold each.

Q : Dispel - Can be cast instantly on a device. If the selected device is mounted on a surface, it reveals itself and dispels any smokes cast in the area (same radius as detection radius) until the end of the round. If the selected device is on an ally, it makes them immune to the first crowd control effect they encounter. 2 charges, 100 gold each.

X (Ultimate) : Akashic Two Prototype : Equip the Akashic Two Prototype Anti-Personnel Device to an Ally ( takes 1 second animation). For the next 20- 30 seconds, the device makes the ally immune to all crowd control effects, reveals objects/enemies in stealth, and outlines enemies in red. The ally also takes 40% less damage from radianite sources, but deals 40% less as well. In addition, the Akashic Two emits a loud noise (as loud as footsteps on normal ground) every 5 seconds, due to the massive radianite  usage. 7 charges.

Notes: Radianite sources means abilities. Whenever the word ‘allies’ is used, it means Aisha herself as well. She can equip the Akashic one or two onto herself as well. 

Usage examples: After equipping E on an ally, instead of waiting for the person to say ‘I’m blinded’ or ‘they’re pushing’ in comms, you can just use dispel/disrupt on them at the start of the round since they don’t have a timer. Disrupt lasts the whole round and dispel lasts till the first cc effect. You can also deploy it onto walls and stuff so enemies have to look away etc to shoot it after you use Dispel/Scan. Also, the ult can be useful for holding clutch angles, or even post plant if they plan to molly, nade, or dart, etc while you’re defusing.",1609542960

VALORANT,2021,1,"I know that a lot of people this act were taken down several ranks, making huge downward leaps like going from Gold to Bronze. I was one of these players as well, just like most other people that this happened to, I got extremely tilted. It felt like everything I had been working towards for the past two acts was just swatted aside like it was nothing, and I hated Riot for it. However, as this act is coming to an end, I’m starting to think that it was actually a good thing that I was taken down from gold two to bronze two.

Around the end of last act, I was starting to feel that my in game mechanics were slipping up a bit. I was no longer confident in my skill, and never pushed out or played aggressively, and this mindset pushed me further into the hole, as I wasn’t giving myself opportunities to improve. Once I got demoted to bronze, my feelings of resentment just amplified exponentially, and I couldn’t figure out how to move forward. This is where I got lucky. I had some amazingly supportive higher elo friends, who were able to motivate me to keep playing comp. in addition to that, they reviewed my VODs, and helped me aim train. I followed the regime for a majority of the act, and it helped me make a drastic improvement. As of right now, I am a plat player, which was a rank that I had been seeking since act 1. 

Getting demoted helped me learn how to push myself to constantly keep improving, and if I hadn’t gotten demoted like this, I don’t think I would have ever escaped my plateau. Thanks to this act, I’m more confident in my skills than I ever have been, and I feel like I’m finally making progress.

Some of you may be thinking that you don’t have enough time to play, or that you aren’t allowed to play as much. To those people I say: I only played 1-1 1/2 hours a day. 

TL;DR - getting demoted 6 ranks helped me to push my self to become better, and helped me reach a goal I had been working for since Act 1",1609544344

VALORANT,2021,1,"Hello valorant players of reddit. I must say that I'm by no means a good player, I'm just platinum 1, mostly by my poor aim and mechanics. If you find that your pure raw skill is not getting you the rank you feel like you deserve, here are some useful tips I learned on my alt account when playing with lower elo players.

&amp;#x200B;

Pick up a microphone!

the biggest issue i saw in low elo was lack of communication. If you pick up a microphone, it is so much easier to call out information and ideas. If you are too scared to talk to random people you might find the communication wheel useful (found in controls) which can make call-outs such as ""going a!"" or ""fall back"" or ""rotate"" etc. But please don't do any hard backseat gaming, it only frustrates the players alive and is often counterintuitive. 

 If nobody is initiating the push, or it feels as if nobody is taking role as leader, do it yourself.

When on attack, often many players will sit outside of the chokepoint, waiting for something to happen, or just to bait out a teammate and not trading out their death. If you find that you are often suck not pushing, pick up a duelist or initiator and try to start the crossing into site. For example, you can smoke off site lines as jett, and dash into site. Or, you could flash with any flash character, and tell your teammates to push with you. I had to learn the hard way from a solo-based game over to a team game, that you cannot win by yourself but rather through teamwork.

Don't blame teammates for holding you back.  

Your selected teammates are NOT the reason you are being held back. Sure, you may have a game where you have an AFK'er and/or a thrower, but there might be another where you get carried and do little. You need to understand that you are the difference maker between a win and a loss. scolding your teammates for their mistakes often makes them perform even worse and hurts the team moral.

Listen to callouts if given!

Recently, I had played a game where all 4 of my teammates were sitting in garage, not doing anything, because they were being spammed by utility. I noticed that 4 of the 5 players on the enemy team had rotated over, and the 5th had been caught off from flanking. I had called for a rotate, but they proceeded to push in and died one by one. You need to play as a team, rather than trying to do your own thing. However solo-based plays, such as lurking, can be fine as you can communicate with your team that you are distracting enemies from potentially rotating or cutting off the flank.

Instantly mute any disruptive audio or toxicity\~

Toxicity is a huge problem in the low ranks, even iron, surprisingly, and toxic players will bring you down and ruin the team moral. You are stuck with these players for the whole game and instant mutes will keep you from not getting distracted.

Learn from your mistakes.

You may often find that you are doing something every round that may end up in you dying or in a bad position. The best way to fix this is to watch your own gameplay and understand why you died. Maybe you pushing into site lines while your team was unprepared, maybe you fed into another player, or maybe you had bad positioning. All these mistakes can be corrected by learning from them.

There are games that are just out of your control.

Sometimes you may find, no matter how many kills, clutches, or plays you make, the score will not be in your favor. Sometimes teammates will not listen and do their own thing, or throw and leave the game. These are just games out of your control, and they aren't setting you back. However there will be games were it is up to you to be the difference maker of a win or a loss. These are the games that determine where you belong, not games that you lose no matter how much you do, or win for how little you do.

Play together and play for trades when in numbers!

I have seen countless throws in lower elo when players feel as if they have already secured the round, and end up feeding into a 1v4, resulting in the enemy clutching. Just because you outnumber the opponents does not mean you have won the round. Instead, play for trades, as peeking/fighting together may result in 1 teammate dying but securing the kill on the enemy. 

Call for saves and buys accordingly.

If you notice that some teammates cannot buy, call for a half buy, and make sure that everyone can afford to buy in the proceeding round. a full save can be called if nobody can buy (obviously) to make sure that you can all afford next round. You need to make sure you are on the same page as your teammates and you can all buy on a following round.

Find out what caused you to lose a previous round!

You might find that the enemy is abusing a flaw in your team's executes, such as spraying down the whole team with an odin, or flushing out and killing everyone with killjoy's utility. If you find that you are constantly losing to the same stuff, find out a way to counter it. Maybe play close range or flash out an enemy odin user, or headshot them before they have time to spray you down with a rifle. Maybe if you're dying to killjoy utility, try to find where  she places the utility and break it before it has a chance to damage your whole team. Or, a player could flank from a site every round, and you can catch onto that and hold his/her flank. The same goes for your side, if you find that the enemy has no control over an area, take control of it and get behind the enemy lines.",1609546285

(I think) if we made it so that you couldn't actually lock in for maybe 30 seconds, it would let the team get their composition together and an actual strat involving all of them made.

VALORANT,2021,1,"So I started playing valorant a little bit ago. I’m just bouncing between Iron and Bronze presently, but I noticed something that happens when I’m in low iron that doesn’t occur in high iron or bronze:

I’ll get a game where 2 people will be ‘afk’. They will be unranked, and simply stand in spawn and fire every 2-3 seconds so they don’t get kicked. This has happened probably half a dozen times to me.

The next thing I see a ton is groups of people, presumably playing together, trapping me in corners, taking the spike and hiding with it all round, or doing nothing but trying to knife people all game.

Is there any actual punishment that is given out to these people? I don’t take competitive super seriously or anything, but it fucking sucks to have your entire match ruined because of these people. I report them, but I’ve never heard of that actually doing anything.",1609547269

Cyphers ultimate on the other hand, is a little underpowered, because it gives enemies a chance to reposition, and it doesnt last nearly as long as it should. I propose a change to cyphers ult, which would make it so his ultimate puts a tracking dart on all remaining enemy players (like his camera dart). This would force enemies to fall back and remove dart, or continue to be tracked. I think this would make his ultimate way more potent. What are your thoughts?",1609557507

VALORANT,2021,1,"Awhile back the Valorant devs released an in-depth analysis of the current state of the clarity in this game during gunfights in relation to hit registration.

[https://playvalorant.com/en-gb/news/dev/the-state-of-hit-registration/](https://playvalorant.com/en-gb/news/dev/the-state-of-hit-registration/)

Playing deathmatch a lot, the issues remain, pretty glaringly, which is one reason I suspect that they haven't rolled out game replays. 

During many gunfights, you can clearly see and hear gunshots wizzing by you and then you're dead, no getting tagged, no getting one tap headshot'd. Are these people actually spraying and getting the luck of the draw or is it just not showing up on my screen the way it's supposed to?

Let's not forget the running and gunning is perhaps one of the worst things about this game which the devs finally claim to be fixing in one of the upcoming updates. Someone runs around the corner and you're dead. No gunshot noise, no visual. Before anyone say's iT's StRaFiNg. No it's not, and this has been proven so many times. It's used at the tournament level. 

Are you guys aiming away from where the person is on your screen to account for where they actually are from the server's point of view? I don't understand how you're supposed to account for this or are we actually relying on luck?",1609561650

VALORANT,2021,1,"The question needs no more explanation, why can I shoot through most wood around the map, but at soon as a few leaves are in the way I can't hit anything and I end up the one dead?

Happened to me like the 4th time on Ascent when watching close to cat from tree room, in the corner with the bush. Bucky shot was right on Breach's chest but only hit 2-3 pellets out of 15 because the rest hit a single leaf that got in the way.

Edit: I was going through bug reports because I was bored and [ran into this](https://www.reddit.com/r/VALORANT/comments/k9514c/valorant_114_bug_megathread/ghlrd9e/?context=3). Apparently the bush has a huge hitbox and I hit that. But still, even if the hitbox was correct and I shot a leaf any gun  should be able to go through a leaf or 10 and still do full damage.",1609563541

To compare this to games like csgo, fortnite, cod, this community is not as heated and is more understanding. Maybe this is different for other people, but this has been my experience in valorant, in the last few matches, I have always used my mic to talk and give comms to them and make sure they don't blame themselves and to not push so much, and in result I have won 5/7 of my ranked matches with 1 draw.",1609564736

I had streaks of performing well but It wasn’t enough and I deranked pretty heavily. I feel like the only thing that makes me throw is when I am tilting, and I’m trying to see if the best way to fix this is to try and find a way to stop tilting in general or just manage my tilt better. 


I don’t know if this helps, but the main cause of me tilting is me not playing well, but I usually start off the day by playing poorly, and I want to get to the point where I can play even if I’m starting out pretty badly. I hate being angry at the game because I love playing it so much but it’s so frustrating not doing as well as you could whether it is because of something the enemy is doing or just not playing as well, and I want to be able to play decently no matter what happens.",1609570417

VALORANT,2021,1,"I am hard-stuck in diamond, ive reached a full dorito of imm2 last act rank(act2) but this act as been a downfall for me. i went down to plat 3.... Then trying to go back up is crazy, it feels impossible. i am a duelist main and i focus on entry. I play mostly Reyna and Phoenix, viper only on icebox don't ask me why lol. 

I usually get 20 kills but also 20 deaths. When i win i can be on top of scoreboard but only get 1 arrow up while my teammates gets 2. I also tend to play too much especially when I'm losing. One day i played 15 ranked and lost 12 of them, i guess i like torture but i don't know when to stop...  


i have a match mvp or team mvp ratio of around 40% which is above average. i ever got a full page of mvp regardless of win or loss.

I entry i often feel like my teammates doesn't follow or my smoke main doesn't know what they're doing. some times i do bad and we lose. but whenever i do good its not a guaranteed win. on blitz my win rate overall is 46.3% means I'm losing more than i win...

I feel like if i could shift this win/loss ratio to 50% i would be ranking up for sure because of how well i perform compared to the others.

I also started to rage lately as i feel like every teammates i get are boosted and i don't think I'm that rank(you probably hear that a lot) and the enemy is either smurfing or hacking, or just have better comm and chemistry.

I'm also tired of having teammates that don't talk for a full half then the only thing they say on the mic is (you should have done this).

I don't know what to do i am quite experienced with gaming I've played high competitive level in csgo and i am now 31 years old, maybe i am washed up but i don't wanna believe this.

I know that i am playing too aggressively and get 2 or 3 frags in a round then i proceed to get another one and die then my team crumble, this happens all the time i feel shitty. I push on Defender side while i shouldn't, or i over commit to gun fights.

VALORANT,2021,1,"Rykael-

E ability
Radiant halo
Free/Recharging
Places his halo in a walkway. Enemies that try to walk past it are highlighted and enemies in its range are damaged overtime
Can be shot; but that also highlights the enemy(s) shooting
Bullets cannot be shot past the area surrounding the halo
Once destroyed; the halo makes a b-line back to Rykael very quickly, giving enemies a vague hint at where he is to balance out having their location revealed for destroying it
Damaging range could be the size of an Omen smoke
To place the halo would be similar to placing an Omen smoke as well
10 second cooldown to place again

C ability
Heavenly crescent 
400 credits
Essentially a boomerang that can be thrown and return to the user
2 options when throwing; in a straight line ahead of you, damaging all enemies it passes thru up to 25 meters(or the first wall it hits) and returning even if it doesn’t make contact with an enemy, or thrown so that it curves around a wall, only returning if it makes contact with an enemy
To throw it around the corner of a wall; it could be launched similar to a Breach flash; by aiming at the corner of the wall you wish for it to travel beyond
Can be thrown at 2 different elevations: high or low, the high elevation can be crouched under, the low elevation can be jumped over(to assist players in avoiding being located)
Players hit in the legs with the low throw will be slowed, players hit in the head with the high throw will be concussed -NOTE: there will not be 2 set elevations when thrown straight, the boomerang will simply be aimed and shot with Mouse 1(concussing all enemies hit), while curving the boomerang will be aimed at the corner of a wall and launched with Mouse 2/alternate fire
This will do 50 damage each time it passes thru an enemy
15 second cool down once it’s returned or retrieved
If Rykael pulls out his weapon or tries to throw his halo while the boomerang is traveling; he will not catch it unless he presses E before it returns, but the boomerang will still land at his feet(picked up with E)
Can be retrieved by the end of the round for free usage next round

Q ability
Angelic light
200 credits
2 charges
Rykael uses his divine energy to shine extremely bright flashing enemies and allies in his line of sight for up to 2 seconds
His body will be the source of the flash, he can still move as normal, but he becomes near-sighted, being slightly less affected by the light

X ability/ultimate 
Divine intervention
7 orbs to use
Rykael can fly up and call upon a swarm of locusts; damaging all enemies within an area, and slightly blurring enemies’ vision doing 45 damage over 4 seconds
If there are less enemies alive; more locusts will focus on less targets therefore increasing the overall damage by 10 for each dead opponent
It will take locusts 2.5 seconds to travel from the heavens to the enemies, and enemies outside of a 35 meter radius will no longer be in range and therefore won’t be affected by the continuous swarm
Rykael will be at the center of the swarm; and must stay still in mid air to channel this divine intervention; his position will be marked on the map
He can utilize his weapons and abilities during the Ultimate -NOTE: if there is only 1 enemy left alive; this ability will not available for use that round, as Rykael has a divine Ego and refuses to call upon the heavens for divine intervention to deal with only 1 measly opponent

VALORANT,2021,1,"Hi everyone. I wish to ask you all if you noticed best time in the day for you to play? 
I've noticed a pattern from personal experience where my best competitive winning time is around noon, hit and miss time towards the end of the day and worst time is early in the morning. Consider that I do same routines for warming up before playing competitive. Wish to get your thoughts on that. Thank you",1609585893

VALORANT,2021,1,"I started playing valorant from Act 2 and i dont spend much. When i first started playing i loved the hivemind knife so much especially the way you equip the knife is so satisfying. But i didn't buy it.

When act 3 came out i loved the ruin dagger even more. Thanks to a friend, i bought the battlepass and i love every bit of it. It is sooo satisfying.

When i see other knife skins like luxe knife and prism knife, I just don't get what so special about them that they cost 1750VP and 2550VP respectively. 

Other knife skins like reaver knife and glitchpop dagger i can still understand what is special about it.

I can even agree that luxe knife is clean and elegant for its price, but for the prism knife i still don't understand. Is there a special reason?",1609586293

VALORANT,2021,1,"Hi all, 

I first played Valorant when it was in the beta, bought a few skins here and there and got refunded +20% when it came out of BETA. I then used those points to buy some different skins once the full game was released. I played a bit longer and ended up going back to playing CS:GO regularly instead. I wanted to have another crack at the game today but when I re-installed the game and logged in all my purchases were gone. No skins and no credits to show for it, even my purchase history shows 0$ spent on the Valorant support page. Has anyone else had this issue? and if so what did you do to fix it?

Is there some way to restore purchases or something similar?

Any help would be much appreciated. TIA",1609590140

VALORANT,2021,1,"Valorant is the first fps game I've dedicated a relatively large portion of time to. The only significant fps experience I had before this was the 50 hours I clocked on cs. So far, since the official launch of the game, I've racked up around 800 hours on the game and an additional 100 on aim labs. All this has resulted in me achieving a highest rank of platinum 3 (since which I've dropped back to plat 2). I love this game, and really wish to maybe win relating tournaments in the future.

My question is, are these aspirations unfounded? Based on my current trajectory, is there any hope for me achieving at least Immortal by the time the year 2021 ends?

VALORANT,2021,1,"I understand the limitations that posts like these have and I know that ultimately this decision should be based off of my interests and playstyle but I'd appreciate some guidance and insight into who I should play mainly.

&amp;#x200B;

# Background info:

I am a CS player turned Valorant player. In CS I've gotten up to around A rank on ESEA and around IM in league play. In league play I'm usually 1st AWP or 2nd AWP. In Valorant I am currently Diamond 1. Throughout my Valorant journey so far I've pretty much always waited until my team picked their agents before picking mine. What this means is I've bounced around from duelist to sentinel to initiator pretty much every game. I feel like this has provided me with both positives and negatives when it comes to my game knowledge but now I'm looking into really honing my skills on a specific character.

&amp;#x200B;

# A little bit about my playstyle:

I like OPing in Valorant but my rifling is fine as well. I definitely prefer OPing defense side a lot more than on attack side in contrast to CS where its more balanced. I don't want to be stuck waiting behind my teammates because of the nature of my utility (this is my gripe with Sage). I like having the option of lurking but of course I don't want to lurk every round. I'm comfortable entrying for my team or going in after, however I feel like I'm better suited being alive for late round situations.

&amp;#x200B;

# Misc. information:

When it comes to a main, I'd prefer an agent who I have a decent shot of being able to play most games but this doesn't disqualify any agent. If you can, please provide your 1st and 2nd choices for who you think I should main. I'd also prefer an agent who I don't need to spend a bunch of time learning line ups for (Sorry Sova).

&amp;#x200B;

If you've read this whole thing, thank you. With this information, who do y'all think would fit the bill as my main?",1609593779
VALORANT,2021,1,"I noticed that playing a support agent makes more difficult you to rank up. As a main Jett, I am noticing that playing a more passive player hurts you in the rank.

Total Net XP required to complete the ACT 3 Battlepass WITHOUT Epilogue: \*\*1,372,000\*\* XP

Total Net XP required to complete the ACT 3 Battlepass WITH Epilogue: **1,622,000** XP

I'm not sure of how much weeklies are worth, since the last pass had some with less or more XP rewards, rather than a consistent amount per mission per week. While they do have quite a bit of XP for finishing them, with the final set filling out around 75,000 last pass. If anyone knows how the weekly system determines the XP changes, or if its a fixed total distributed differently, or whatever is happening with that (so I can add it into the calculations and see what the true daily XP requirement is), hmu in the replies.

XP Per Match for each Gamemode

Unrated / Competitive: Min **1300** XP, Flawless Win (No Lost Rounds) **3900** XP, Max **5100** XP.

Spike Rush: Fixed **1000** XP

Deathmatch: Fixed **900** XP

Custom Matches: No XP

Conclusion (Oct. 14, 2020): To finish the Battlepass (but not the Epilogue) by the final day, you would need to play one of the following sets every single day (assuming all daily missions are completed, ***and not accounting for weekly missions).***

1. 2 Full Unrated / Competitive matches of which both are tiebreaker wins, plus one match earning at least 1045 XP.
2. 2 Flawless Unrated / Competitive wins and 1 non-flawless match earning **3325**\+ XP.
3. \~11.25 Spikerush matches, assuming Daily Missions do not require gun/shield buying.
4. \~12.5 Deathmatch matches, assuming Daily Missions are completed, something you cannot do without playing other gamemodes, making this technically impossible to do.
5. \~17 Deathmatch matches, assuming Daily missions are not completed.
6. Some combination totaling **11,245** XP. Alternatively **15,245** XP if Daily Missions are not completed within said combination.

I will update this if any XP gain changes are announced, be it tweaks to gain rate, mission rewards, a new gamemode, or anything else that could impact XP gain.

It seems like two winning matches per day seems to be the ideal, with the remaining XP being accounted for by weekly missions and then some, however since winning matches is never a guarantee, and there is no XP buffer system to ensure consistency, this means its also quite a gamble since if you lose matches too often you won't be able to complete the pass without spending in excess of an hour every day on just Valorant (never mind any other interests or hobbies).

Edit 1: Fixed XP total, and tweaked related values to match. Also added an extended conclusion.

Edit 2: Changed the conclusion a bit to emphasize that because I don't know what the weeklies are worth in total or per week, they are not accounted for but are very much there and depending on how much they will be, could make it more practical for someone who does not play daily to complete.

Edit 3: So, I want to add in the new epilogue teirs, but I have no idea what their xp cost is like (and its probably unreasonable for people who don't play Valorant a crap ton).

Edit 4: Deathmatch xp values were tweaked, there is a new temporary snowball fight mode coming out, spike rush's xp reward was also changed, and there are now 5 epilogue teirs with unknown xp costs. None of these are reflected in the above values yet.

Edit 5: Epilogue teirs values added in, added a separate xp total conclusion for doing or not doing the Epilogue.

Edit 6: Fixed xp discrepancy for Epilogue teirs",1609598756

Hello people, I share my last video that is a montage of Reyna about what would happen in the mind of a main, the idea is that you have fun with the editions while the ost of the ninja turtles of snes plays in the background. The first part of the video is an intro where you see the community's reaction to the new league of legends champion (Seraphine) and how this led me to change the game and start playing Valorant, then comes an edited gameplay playing Reyna combining the rhythm of the song in the background with the gameplay and quality memes, since in this part of the video I concentrate most of the editing, once the gameplay is finished there is a version of the opening of the anime Blend S but in Valorant version, using instrumental song of this and fitting the voices of Raze, Jett, Killjoy, Reyna and Sage as if they were part of the song, choosing these agents because they are the ones we use with my group of friends and using this version of blend s to introduce clips playing with my friends, this part is not in English but the subtitles are set so that they can translate it into their language.

I hope you like it and support me, from now on my content will be based on Valorant and I am already working on a video with this edition of Jett or Sage.

VALORANT,2021,1,"First of all this is not my problem, I just present a solution to the toxicity that some complain of and Riot having to fix exploits and do balance for deathmatch when they just wanted a simple warm up

I think deathmatch needs to stop showing the scoreboard, kill count and any sort of stats while in the match and remove the killcap to keep it time based. Also when the match is finished, it should only show personal stats only. it seems comparison breeds toxicity on an individual level and a feel of inferiority that causes really bad behaviour and habits that I see people trying to exploit deathmatch respawn to farm kills and camping portals with shotguns, waiting for the sound of you walking away or killing someone else, some weird insecure things that can accumulate and ruin the mode for some people. This suggestion will also increase a player's focus as they only need to think about themselves. No need for someone to whine about a sound or corner camper getting the best score, and no need for the camper to even camp for the kills as there's no one to compare to. Pure solitude.

I know some players are like radiant born and might have gotten out of Iron very easily. I have little experience with FPS, but is it normal for me to be stuck in Iron? or i am just bad and i should take a break/quit.

My aim is not very great but i always do DM and practice before going into ranked. 

and one more thing, i was in Iron 3 and i got 3 arrows but i didn't go to bronze. why? i thought riot made it that is easier to get out of iron. And no it was not my first game in Iron 3. I had gotten a double arrow before that",1609606813

I usually just mute them if they continuously ask me but they still try by following me around sometimes.

As you can see from the obviously very hard work I put into coming up with this idea, it's a very thought out plan. Reyna would have a voice line that activates once a game if/when the player that choose her is playing below a certain K/D percentage. I think this would make it a little more fun and interactive for players who are having a bad game as Reyna, that way their moods might be lifted somewhat.",1609613580

VALORANT,2021,1,"During 9 months, I play this game with standard frog ADSL connection, which is :

* ping between 50ms and 90ms.
* download bandwidth of 12Mbps
* upload bandwidth of 0.8Mbps

Wired ethernet and no wifi activated (exlusive internet).

I did have a lot of ping spikes (like +400ms during 3 seconds and multiple times per game).

On top of that, game wasn't always smooth. In some games, I could not react at all when the enemy was peeking. It's like the enemy was prefering with wallhack (which obviously was not the case 99% of the time). I had to shoulder peek or wide swing every time, never taking direct lines (even broken ones) and pray that the surprise effect will be enough.

In some games, it did work just fine, but it wasn't the majority of my games.

It's what I called the ""desync"" feeling. Not even sure if there is a real technical issue behind this word... I don't think so.

Since 3 weeks, I got fiber connection :

* ping between 20ms and 40ms
* download bandwidth of 380Mbps
* upload bandwidth of 150Mbps (at least)

**This is not the same game !**

I don't have the desync feeling anymore, no more ping spikes, I manage to do insane flicks which never succeeded before (because of ping I presume). My game is the same than Twitch streams.

My conclusion is that the game is heavily dependant of network conditions.

The game seems to be really harder with ping above 40ms and low upload bandwidth. Maybe there is a desync issue which is occuring after a ping spike. I don't know.

I wanted to share my experience. If you got poor networkd conditions and you don't understand how you've been rekt that hard in some games, you may experience the same issue than me. You still can improve and win though.

Now, I don't have any more excuse and I'm fine with that. I never experience ""unfair"" death anymore.

EDIT : I did not want to compare games in the first place but I have no choice because of some comments. I played csgo for 6 years with the first connection, and I played a lot on FaceIt too, which has 128 tick servers. I never experienced ping spike, and I never been disadvantaged that hard by my connection. And I had worst ping too (80-90ms minimum). The desync feeling or peekers advantage has never been an issue. So the title should be : **the games depends much more of internet conditions than other games.**",1609618850

VALORANT,2021,1,"This would be an awesome way to give players occasional opportunities to rotate their skins without spending the extra cash and stockpiling skins for the same weapon. It also fits well with the night (/black) market theme!

Surely Riot has more data than I do here, but I can imagine this being a win-win for them as well, particularly as the pool of skins continues to grow. This ends up acting similarly to the steam market where volvo takes a cut of each transaction between players, and I think would incentivize players to get more skins (*spend more) in the long-term. At least for me, there's definitely a bit of psychological barrier when considering buying a second weapon skin, as it feels wasteful. Having the simultaneous option to buy the skin at a discounted rate also would make me feel better about selling at a loss.

I vaguely recall an interview with a Riot dev where they mentioned eventually providing some way to sell back skins, maybe they already had the intention of eventually doing this? The night market definitely feels incomplete and smells of agile development 😝",1609620509

VALORANT,2021,1,"I forget how many actual games I've seen have this, but I've run this through a lot of my friends and they agreed on it being a good start to an idea at least.

Now for what I'm thinking here. I am a peak gold 3 and even in silver and gold, hell even plat lobbys, I've had people smurfing at least once every 5 games. Sometimes on my team. (as someone who finds solo que better than with others) I've often run into 4-5 stacked smurfs or trolls. You know what those accounts aren't? Their mains. I think that you should have to have a phone number verification to play comp, or require way more games to play comp. The problem with the second option is that accounts made beforehand would still be active and capable of playing. 

Now this might sound unappealing to a lot of people but, I have 3 alt accounts. Currently I have 2 brought up to at least bronze 3 and play on them when I'm not doing as well as I'd like. The other is an iron 3 account. Also my first ever account. When I'm on there it's normally either 4am or to play with my iron friends. I refuse to carry them tho so I'll try to sit middle frag and help more through communication than through just straight demolishing the other team (as people playing in a lower rank to play with their friends should) 

One thing my friends brought up is possibly having a limit of accounts linked to a number. Like 2 or 3 accounts to a number and such. Only problem with this number verification is that I don't know if riot would be able to get permission or even be allowed to implement something like this at all. I'm relatively new to the whole fps gaming scene having only joined in June when valorant fully released so I know very little about the limitations of games like this.

Now obviously there is always going to be a work-around to stuff like this (such as fake phone numbers) but I think if nothing else, it would reduce the amount of 6-10 year olds in our games. (Yes I've run into a 6 y/o) I feel like there needs to be something that eliminates or at least lessens the amount of smurfs and alts in the game. I feel like eliminating them from the comp scene would leave the rankings looking much more accurate as well, seeing less iron 1 accounts.

I apologize if this is all over the place I didn't plan this out I kind of just wrote as I went and I never really did very well in English. Anyway anything that gets this seen by more people is much appreciated!",1609623889

VALORANT,2021,1,"Just wanted to share this for anyone new to the game because I have seen a lot of new people run from the bomb during the second tick or something cause they thought they had no time.

Spike Detonation - 45 seconds since bomb plant

Spike Defusal - 7 seconds

First tick is 25 seconds, meaning this is the time to rotate/decide to go for it or save/gather info and start making your move

Second tick is 10 seconds, meaning you should start picking up your pace if you have committed to the retake and probably start defusing (try to get it half way, etc)

Third tick is 5 seconds, meaning you HAVE to start defusing or else you won't have enough time

4th tick is 5 seconds, meaning you will have no time to defuse if you aren't already defusing during the 3rd tick

The bomb takes 7 seconds to defuse.

VALORANT,2021,1,"I'm just going to get straight to the ideas to buff her. Although she is really balanced rn, her key designs with respect to her utilities are why people don't use her. As a controller the most basic tactic is to smoke heaven on a bomb site. While I can smoke of many heaven windows like, split b (toxic orb), heaven a (toxic orb), bind a (toxic orb), split a (toxic screen), the only useful change I see here with respect to toxic orb is to retract it similar to Killjoy retracting her bots.
As for her toxic screen, many times enemies never respect this as it barely does any damage (negligible). Hence enemies passing the toxic wall either take permanent damage similar to Phoenix blaze wall, or get vulnerable status. None of that wall retraction bs, which will make her broken.

Another idea although it may seem broken is not to revert decay damage, unless in vipers pit.

VALORANT,2021,1,"I know its a little late and I'm not sure if anyone made a post on this already but I have a theory that the night market has a predetermined roll based not on RNG(random number generator) but on whether the account owner is someone who has already did microtransactions in the game.

First, I admit that this is just a theory based on anecdotal evidence my main and alt account(not smurf just don't want ppl to know I'm online sometimes lol) and and people on my friends list but I have come to the conclusion that people who spent money on the game( doesn't matter the amount) were less likely to get higher tier cosmetics in their night market. 

Now I can understand that if you have alot of skins then their is less good skins for you to get in the shop in the first place, but for most ppl that isn't the case. I have a decent amount of skins, mostly 875-1275 along with a prime and oni, yet I only got blue and green in mine, other friends in my situation shared similar results. But on my alt and friends who didn't spend money on the game were more likely not just to get a higher skin but more spots of higher skins. So  if this is true, why is this a problem and why would Riot do that. 

The issue with something like this is that you are potentially being gatekept from a discount market that everyone has the access to because Riot wants to entice people, who don't normally spend money on microtransactions, to make their first purchase because statistically once you have broken the ""microtransactions on a free game barrier""  you're more likely to continue to spend more money. But for someone who has previously spent money on the game you wouldn't be the target of this, **and since they know that you're already willing to purchase microtransactions at full price, why give it to you at a discount?** It's a win/win for them at the end of the day tbh. And If this is the case than that is kinda messed up in my opinon but it's there company at the end of the day but they could be just open about a system of discounts for new players or something idk. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Again This is just a theory.**  I admit the flaws in this but I posted this was hoping for smart redditers to fill in the holes or for Riot to respond I guess.",1609636247

VALORANT,2021,1,"Currently, if you disconnect for a minute and reconnect you'll get a 10 minute timeout the first time, an hour timeout the second time, and a 2 hour timeout the third time. I think this is how it works anyway.

To play in ranked games initially you must win 10 unranked games.

My idea, while playing ranked games, is to replace the 10 minute timeout with a requirement to win 2 Spike Rush games. Replace the 1 hour timeout with winning 1 unranked game, and so on. 

If you disconnect in an unranked game, replace the timeouts with winning a certain number of Spike Rushes before you can play unranked again. If someone disconnects in Spike Rush, require them to play out a Deathmatch or two.

This way there are consequences for disconnecting and you can still play Valorant. It should also be relatively simple to implement since the devs can reuse the code they already have for playing Ranked games initially. Lastly, if it's someone's last match of the day a timeout is not a deterrent, but the requirement to win an Unranked game or Spike Rush would carry over.

Do you think this would be an improvement over the current system?",1609639564

Role: Initiator

Signature: 1 charge. 40s.

Sunny Day- Immediately Throw a small device. Once it hits the ground, it creates a small radius that eliminates any smoke touching it for 2 seconds. Only a chunk of a Viper Pit gets removed with this. Viper Poison Orb and Wall get turned off for 2 seconds.

Ability 1: 2 charges. 200 creds.

Lightning Bolt- Equip a tactical map. Primary fire on the map to mark an area. Secondary Fire to summon a lightning bolt on that area that charges for .75s then crashes down, flashing everyone who looks at it for 1.5s. If an enemy is 4m or less away from it, they get flashed for 2.2s.

Ability 2: 1 charge. 200 creds.

Tidal Zone- Throw a small ball of water. After it lands it starts a small channel on that spot for 1.5s. After the channel it creates a small zone of water that reduces ground damage pools (Brimstone Molly, Phoenix Fire, Viper Snake Bite) by 80% for 3 seconds.

Ultimate: 7 charges.

Heaven Rain- Summon a large storm radius that gives enemies that walk through it slight Wavy Vision. This lasts 10s. During the storm, 5 random Lightning Bolts come striking down in the radius.",1609640520

I don’t play overwatch, well, because with most of the characters, abilities matter way to much. I don’t play CSGO anymore because there is no utility mixing up. It’s all just smokes flashes and Molotovs. I played valorant because it looked like most of killing abilities were really easy to avoid, and punished you for being out of position, and not for playing the game. Then I played against a Raze for my first time. I personally find it quite annoying the Raze’s grenades don’t match their visual very much, and going far away and getting hit by it, even though you didn’t think you were in it. Raze doesn’t punish you for being out of position, she simply punishes you for playing the game. I don’t think she’s overpowered, just really annoying. If they were to maybe make the visuals of the grenade match it a little more, I’d be happy, and not being getting tiled going from 150 hp to 130 when I’m 10 meters away.

Often you get into a game of comp, and immediately 4 duelists are instalocked. This often results in dodging (or just an overall unfun/lost game as you have an awful teamcomp)

A sort of solution for this would be to allow your team to vote to reset agent selections on your team, (needs 3 votes/5 players eg, kind of like a surrender vote) which would force everyone to reselect their agent.

Otherwise, it could also be solved by just forcing you to be unable to select agents for the first 15 or so seconds of competitive so that you can discuss team composition.

Of course, the real solution to instalocking is to force people to be able to confidently play multiple agents, so that they can flex to a good team composition, but I don't know how that would be achieved.",1609643650

VALORANT,2021,1,"Q1: What is Elo Hell?

A: It is where you perform well but are still unable to rankup from say Iron to Bronze

Q2: Isn't Elo hell just an excuse?

A: No, it's not. Elo hell does exist. A number of factors exist for why Elo Hell is apparent. Smurfs, toxicity, bad comms, bad crosshair placement, bad game sense, and so on

Q3: What is the main factor of Elo Hell?

A: From personal experience it's comms. While smurfs are there, in my opinion(and strictly opinion) comms contribute much more. In games like Valorant, if there is no communication, then there aren't callouts, which leads everyone basically 1v5ing because there is no communication. While pings and chat are helpful, they sometimes will not be able to relay the information

Q4: Where is Elo Hell most apparent?

A: It all really depends. Iron, Bronze, and Silver are the biggest elo Hell epicenters. It gets progressively harder to rank up as you go from iron to bronze to silver as the skill gap widens. But that doesn't mean Elo Hell doesnt exist in the higher ranks. There are hardstuck plat and gold players but Elo Hell is most apparent in the lower ranks, especially Iron and Silver

Q5: What is a way to get out of Elo Hell

A: Don't be toxic as even if one player dc's or afk's, it will result in something always bad. Do callouts even if your teammates aren't, be encouraging, offer advice without appearing condescending. Reflect on your own mistakes before blaming others

My aim isn’t even that good today. My dm scores weren’t great today and I’m taking longer on 50 bots, plus my hands are really cold and I’m missing shots I would normally hit. I still was always 3rd or higher in my team.

I think iron just has too many afks, trolling teammates, smurfs, and people who just don’t know what they were doing.

I’m just a bronze after all, so I don’t know if it was luck, “using” my team, or me just carrying that finally got me up, but I’m guessing it’s just cross your fingers and try your best to carry until you get it.

Can anyone confirm if this is how they got out, or is there some other way? Youtube guides all said to carry so I wanted to compare and see if there were other ways.

VALORANT,2021,1,"I think the main reason this happened was because I would have my crosshair at head level, then I would pull down + crouch which brought it down to body level. This obviously wasn't working, so I switched it up a bit. I switched my crouch key to C so that if I needed it for something else it was there but my instant-crouch muscle memory would go away. At first it was really difficult, I kept wanting to keep pulling down until my crosshair was where it used to be, but over time I adjusted. I played 5 deathmatches, and won 2 of them. My aim was easily 3x better than it was before. My deathmatch score reflected that was well. I was able to tap fire confidently, now that it was actually reliable and it would land on their head. I could kill them way faster than before. My movement was better because I could adjust without the crouch speed penalty. All in all, I plan on keeping it like this for a long time to really work it in with how much improvement I've seen. I suggest a lot of you should too.",1609654692

VALORANT,2021,1,"As a sage main, I feel like it is necessary for me to post this.

1. If you get healed by a sage, stay out of combat so the orb can last the entire duration which heals you for the 60.

2. There is a 45s cool down so if you see someones health start rising all of a sudden, chances are the sage has healed someone else so  they can’t heal you for a while.

3. Because of the 45s cool down, if you have only taken a small amount of damage, Im not going g to waste a heal on that.

4. If the sage has a revive available, the current situation might not be a good circumstance to revive you, so they shouldn’t revive you.

E.g. if it is a 1v5 we are probably going to lose this round even if the sage revives you. There are multiple enemies nearby who could kill us both before we can react. If it’s a 4v1 we are probably going to win that round anyway so it would also be a waste.

5. This might sound selfish but if a duelist and the sage is on 40 health, the sage should prioritise healing herself over the duelists. Once the sage heals herself she has an extra 60 health which could enable them to retreat and provide support for the team while waiting for the cooldown so they can heal you afterwards.

6. A dead sage has much more of an effect on a team than a dead duelist, so protecting the sage is more important than protecting a duelist..

7. Also sentinels kit don’t allow them to get out of a sticky situation unlike how a initiator typically has flashes, a controller can use smokes or a duelist can make getting the kill or get out of the situation easier with their abilities.

Thank you for reading what many people who don’t play sage lack the knowledge of, and can make the life of a sage player so much easier and more enjoyable.",1609656429

Maybe the Phoenix with 20 kills has more kills than the Brimstone with 15, but it was Brim's smokes that made Phoenix's firefights way easier enough to get those kills. Smokes blocking enemies should absolutely earn points because being the **Most Valuable Player** of your team is more than just getting the most kills, right?

Heck, it might do a little to solve the perception around Brimstone. Guy has the fastest deployable smokes out of all the controllers. Maybe a little credit is deserved.

VALORANT,2022,1," I just realised that you lose 3RR for dodging games consecutively. I still hate this idea because: 

1. Your team instalocked 4 duelists   
2. You have team mates who disabled voice comms.   
3. You recognise the name of some player who was toxic last game or is a known thrower.   
4. You've already played the same map 3 times.  

Regardless of those reasons, the third is the highlight here. It is absolutely ridiculous that I lose 3RR because I don't want to play with the same idiot who was deliberately throwing last game. Why should I be penalised for that? It's even worse when you have the morons with their names hidden, only for you to realise after they start talking shit as the game starts.  

This could all be avoided by having a similar block list feature to overwatch. A balance where you can only have a maximum of say 3 people on it so you will never get into a match with them on your team.

This habit of course would be transferred into Valorant because it also offers a significant increase in accuracy. Claiming that you’re hitbox is smaller so you’ll get shot less is a double-edged sword. Though it is true that your hitbox shrinks, typically we aim for chest-up. When you crouch, people will nearly always headshot you because your head is now located to chest level. This now allows cheap weapons to have a TTK much quicker. For example, the Spectre will get two headshots if the opponent is crouching if the initial shot was chest level. Unbind your crouch button for a month so you lose the habit of crouching.

That being the OP and I’m honestly annoyed at this point because there just seems to be no counter I was diamond and Deranked to plat 2 now I’m not saying that this is entirely the ops fault but a majority of games looked like this .



We lead the half or it goes equal 6-6 7-5 8-4 and we get a good lead then the opponent saves up the jett buys an op and boom our lead is gone we communicate flashes stuns peeks etc but nope jett just shoots away and dashes if we try to trade her? She just smokes herself and repels again with a new angle.



My genuine question is what can actually be done to counter the op will a nerf be issued and I think this is more of a jett problem than an op problem but I’m not aur anymore",1641050586

VALORANT,2022,1,I 100% did not choke the ace....,1641052233
VALORANT,2022,1,"So the idea behind this is to give players a choice on which side they want to start on. At the beginning of a round all players start without guns and abilities. They then have to win a knife fight against the enemy team, the winner gets to decide on which side their team is gonna start. 

When pros play a best of 3 they have map picks, but we cant really do that for competitive so if we add a knife round we could give players a bit more control over the randomness of competitive. 

The choice on which side to start on is very powerful, if you play a heavy defender sided map you have to expect to loose some rounds on attacker. But since mental is such an importent component to ranked many players succumb to the tilt and surrender before the side switch happens. 

The round would only take a minute so it doesnt really add to the lenght of a match, but since competitive games can go into overtime, time isnt really an issue.

Maybe you guys would like to share how you feel about this idea, yey,ney or maybe ?",1641052849

VALORANT,2022,1,"Hello,

We all know the ranking system and MMR is very advanced &amp; a secret formula but here are some Interesting questions regarding the rank system that we actually don't really know the answers too.

1. If someone wants your skin, &amp; you request it &amp; they buy you the skin, then you swap skins does that effect your eco/economy rating? your asking for a weapon every round to give someone else the skin, does that lowers/highers your rating depending on if your the buyer or receiver.
2. if you use your cypher ult &amp; it displays 5 players instead of 3 because two of them are not dead, does that benefit you more or is it based how many people are killed within a 20 second time limit after displaying where the enemies are?
3. Killing people with different weapons in the same round.
4. If you place your sage wall &amp; the enemies fire bullets at the wall does the system detect your defending? depending on if the bombed is planted?
5. if you cancel the omen ultimate so your able to see where the enemies are does the cancel have a negative effect?
6. when you flash someone does a flash record when it flashed them? &amp; do you have to kill them within a certain time period? or If you flash for your team mate &amp; he gets the kill does that benefit you more then you getting the kill?

Keep the questions coming, lets try and work some of them out &amp; they is no right or wrong answer to anything, &amp; the ranking system is way more complex then people think.

In my experiences, If you get less deaths then your enemies or allies that seems to be a big factor &amp; also if the enemies are higher ranked then you that also seems to be a big factor.",1641067845

VALORANT,2022,1,"I'm namely talking about the following things:

**r.OneFrameThreadLag (1|0)**  

&gt; Whether to allow the rendering thread to lag one frame behind the game thread (0: disabled, otherwise enabled) 

**r.FinishCurrentFrame (1|0)**  

&gt; If on, the current frame will be forced to finish and render to the screen instead of being buffered. This will improve latency, but slow down overall performance.  

As well as [Unreal Frame Syncing Model](https://docs.unrealengine.com/4.27/en-US/SharingAndReleasing/LowLatencyFrameSyncing/).

VALORANT,2022,1,"I've been playing Valorant on and off since release, usually starting at Diamond 2-3 and working my way up into the Immortal ranks before I lose interest.

My raw aim is decent to good judging by Kovaaks scores and my reaction time on [humanbenchmark.com](https://humanbenchmark.com) averages out between 160-170ms with peaks of 140ms reactions and dips to 180ms

A recurring annoyance I have whenever I play Valorant is my inability to hold angles. I have to position my crosshair ridiculously far to hit shots on people running into me.

Watching back my footage it usually takes me around 16 frames at 60fps to react to a peek. That's 256ms and seems atrociously bad to me.

Does anybody else by chance count the frames it takes them to react to peeks so I can compare? Is 16 frames in-game reaction time normal and holding angles statically is just not a thing in Valorant?

I don't follow the proscene at all and there is still no replay function for me to study VODs, so I'm unsure if I'm just trying to do the impossible here and holding angles statically is just trash?",1641073618

This is just something I picked up playing stuff like Apex and COD - traditional FPS's - but I really need help trying to break this habit.

Also, it's not like I'm trying to run and gun or anything my issue is more shooting JUST BEFORE I stop moving which ends up effecting my accuracy.

VALORANT,2022,1,"Hey there guys! Since, 2021 got over, which was your worst performing map (be it aim-wise, gamesense etc.)? Mine is Split due to changing elevations found all over the map and so many off-angles where enemies can be. I am going to perfect my crosshair placement (with reference to nearby objects), positioning and improve my choice-making for type of shooting (tap, burst or spray).

don't panic .its a good thing.now its time to retaliate &amp; do the same thing to them.

things to do now.

don't die , make swift calls to fall back and retake , don't waste unnecessary utilities , control the back site-important 
( plz add if anything more in below comments. this is my first season &amp; my first fps)

things not to do.

camp inside site and get triple peeked ,  wasting slow orbs , nades ,blinds ( retake is different from 'giving time for your team to rotate') , retaking without coordination.
add more in comments.

how to execute retake???

seasoned players , give your strategy below.

retake is most often only seen in comp. coz it need time &amp; coordination. but when the opponents are doing planned bully rushing ,its the only solution.",1641102890

This could be useful in communication settings where audio isn't possible/working or when I have to mute teammates. As well, it would be a nice indicator for my team that they can understand and react to quickly!

E.g. pinging that you're going to throw a flash over a wall so your teammates immediately know to peek without having to clutter voice comms/give another indicator so the team can work together more smoothly. I think it would help especially in ranked/solo q so that you can coordinate more on the fly with random teammates.

I am shooting the sheriff correctly but I am not sure I am following the bpm metronome or hearing it correctly, I have a terrible ear for music.

My observation says standing is 125 bpm.Crouched  you can shoot a little bit faster and I think its 135 bpm.

Can someone confirm , or be more accurate?

Rihanna - Only Girl is 125 bpm but it seems to fast  
Rihanna - Don't Stop The Music is 125 bpm but that seems to work I really don't know need some help.

edit:Someone said for Deagle in CSGO""The ideal tap interval for the Deagle is 0.55s(this is true for all pistols)This results in an ideal BPM of 60/0.55 = **109.1 BPM**Staying Alive is 103 BPM""

Now I know there isn't any gain playing stretched in Val, it's more preference, but I thought I'd share this in case anyone else wanted to try it.

I'm not enjoying native res and playing on 27"" with the monitor further back feels wrong, normally I have the monitor right in front of my face. I know I could just return the monitor and stick with the 24"" but I wanted an all rounder, God of War is coming out and I can't wait to use this to it's full potential.

So I ended up changing aspect ratio through the monitors os to 16:9 (24""w)

VALORANT,2022,1,"currently immortal 2 rn and I was looking at the leaderboard to see that there is almost 24k people in immortal, idk if its just me but I feel like the skill gap in immortal is way too big and I think one of the reasons for that is the amount of players in the rank, I have seen players that play like radiants and others that look like they belong in plat. I feel like 20k + people in a rank that is supposed to be considered ""high elo"" is kind of a joke hitting immortal doesnt even mean anything now since anyone can get it now.",1641123949
VALORANT,2022,1,"So I'm a new player to valorant(and fps in general) and I use a mouse DPI of 3000 as that's what I feel most comfortable with. I pretty much never need to move my hand - I just move my wrist. But according to videos and other people on youtube I should prob be using a DPI between 400 to 800 and moving my whole hand.   


Should I change DPI to 800 and learn to get used to it or is 3000 DPI fine?",1641124362

VALORANT,2022,1,"Hello everyone. 

Just a quick question, any insights or opinions welcomed.

I’m planning to buy one of BENQ Zowie monitors for Valorant. Which one is ultimately the best, or known to be best? Cost is absolutely not an issue, I just want the best. Sometimes, less is more, therefore, I am asking :) Thank you!

p.s. do people use the dyac+ feature on these monitors? or just have the turned off (i.e. pros)",1641125639

In CS I have casted for: UCC, GameFace, NerdStreetGames, CEVO, ChallengerMode and others.So far in Valorant I have done:  30Bombgg, UK University Valorant and Valorant Cash Cup.

I'm not looking to get paid although that would be a bonus if that's possible, but I am mainly looking for experience. As my Ingame knowledge grows, so will my casting/commentating.

My mic is an Audio Technica AT2020 + Scarlet 2i2.Am able to do interviews and pre-match talk as well as provide some animated graphics for teams/players introductions.

If anyone is looking for a caster I am available most days. EU tournaments preferred as timezone differences can cause issues depending on where out of the GMT timezone a tournament is held/runs.

VALORANT,2022,1,I was looking at some of the skins I own and noticed that the previews for some skins matched the theme for some characters. We can all agree based off the Versus//Sage VS Omen calling card that Sage and Omen are opposite/Enemies. For the weapon skin packs of Ruination and Sentinels of light the background of the guns shows two figures dueling. One in the light and one from the dark. If you look at the previews for each of the skins you notice that Sage is the character used to show the upgrade variants for Sentinels of light while Omen is used to show Ruinations. This might explore the divide between both characters or Im think too much into it. Anyway that’s just something cool I noticed.,1641137283

VALORANT,2022,1,"So a few hours ago I played an unrated game, in an attempt to warm up to play comp. about two or three rounds in the enemy team says “knife fight mid” and 3/5 members on my team agree. For the next 10 or so rounds my team called out where to meet and those who wanted too had a knife fight. Well the issue is that I was genuinely trying to play and warm up, so after *both* teams realized I wasn’t on board for knifing, my team started calling out my location for the enemy to kill me so that they could go back to knifing again. Only after the other person on my team who didn’t want to knife Alt+f4’ed did the enemy decided they wanted to play normally again. Needless to say -being a person down- we lost. But that’s beside the point. 

I asked multiple times (3 I think) during the game in all chat if we could play normally cause I wanted to warm up, and both teams laughed it off and continued to give away my and my other sane teammate’s location so the others could knife fight. I reported everyone who was giving away locations in game, but I’ve never seen that actually do anything. 

Is there any way to actually convince these kinds of people to just play the game normally, or should I just follow suit and also alt+f4? I ended up just giving up after that game and never even playing any ranked as I had planned too, cause I was too frustrated to play. This is not the first time I’ve had a similar experience, and every time is just as frustrating.",1641140899

Hello everybody! Hope you are doing well

Chamber's addition to game felt like a breath of fresh air. I wanted a sentinel to play on Split, but was getting too bored to play the extremely passive style of KJ. So now, I am a Chamber main on split :D

That's not the main point tho. The main point is, we got free Sheriff and OP skins! (kinda). I love the headhunter so much. Its elegance, its sound, everything. It also gives the 'skin buff' like if its an actual sheriff skin.

So, to show my appreciation towards Riot and Chamber, I created the headhunter with cardboard and paper. It took me about a week and a half of work. The design had to be simplified for my own convenience, please don't mind

Materials used: i) Cereal box cardboard, ii) Colored paper, iii) Chamber's permission

VALORANT,2022,1,"So today I was zoning out and thinking of a new Valorant skin collection. Now since we already got the snowfall this wouldn't really make sense but I think it's a good idea. So the name could just be winter wonderland 2.0 or snowfall 2.0 and it would be a premium skin with animations. Now I haven't thought of a model for the guns but for the knife I think it should be another candy cane but instead of an axe animation it would be a dagger animation (reaver knife, glitchpop dagger, etc.) or like the prime karambit and the long part of the candy cane could be pointy which I just did to my candy cane I'm eating right now. For the kill banners it could maybe be a Santa shushing with his finger or Rudolph. The finisher could be like Santa's sleigh moving in a circle around the dead body in the air and dropping presents down that disappear after a second and also right when they die a ""ho ho ho"" sound effect plays. And for the kill sounds I don't really have a good idea for this but it could be like a jingle from a bell.",1641143194

VALORANT,2022,1,"It’s 2022, and that means it’s time for me to address what I’ve learned over the past almost two years of playing this game like it’s my religion (Can’t believe May is 4 months away).

Now what I’m addressing here is the subclasses of certain agents in their respective roles (And yes I’m covering my take on the duelist especially.)

Now if there’s anything this game and it’s agents have taught me, it’s that there’s a subtype of each individual role, especially considering that I’ve watched how different people play, I’ve learned agents are meant to play in different playstyles.

We’ll address Sentinels first - Seeing the addition of Chamber to the game has taught me one thing - We have those meant for defending a site post plant and helping to make it easier to hold said site (Looking at Sage and Killjoy here.) Following this we have a hybridized Agent of sorts, somebody who can hold down a site on defense and also watch flank on attack (Looking at Cypher!!) Finally we have the other end, one specifically for watching flank and playing to hold onto map control, however, they may struggle to hold onto a site on their own and stall, and might need support to hold a site (Where Chamber may reside, KEYWORD - MIGHT).

Sentinel TLDR - KJ + Sage - Site Defender; Cypher - Hybrid Defender/Flank Watcher; Chamber - Primary Flank Watcher, Might need support on Site Defense (KEYWORD MIGHT)

Next we’ll look at Initiators, the ones who make the calls for pushing a site typically. I have these divided into a 3 Subclass Set - Intel, Team Players, and Entries. Falling into Intel we have Sova, His kit is well known as the solution to any site clear prior to entry. Team player agents is reserved specifically for Breach. Although strong, his abilities are meant to be played off of by a team mate to clear site. Entries go to Skye and Kay/O. I’m sorry but if Chamber can tell Kay/O’s team he wants to play and Kay/O says ‘No lol’ then It’s kind of a given. Skye is a given due to her specific kit that allows her to keep a site clear.

Duelists are next on the list. As a primary Controller main I can confirm from my 5 Stacks that, and hear me out on this, NOT ALL DUELISTS CAN ENTRY!!!

For starters, we’ll go over the Space Makers, those meant to entry - Looking at you Raze and Jett Mains. However, ask your team to make it easier to push out, this is more than smokes, flashes, intel - you help your duelists entry, you’ll get a win

Next up is the Supporting Duelists, People who help with making the space clear and clearing site. These are the ones who will not always be the best alone, but can be amazing with their team. I’m looking at Phoenix and Yoru. Great distractions with a gate crash and ult and also the ability to blind nerds on site.

Then we have the, well, duelist subtype. She excels in fighting opponents one on one, and can do so extremely well. This is Reyna, I’d reserve her to lurking after the push onto site, not before.

Finally, we’re looking at controllers. We’ll focus on the 2 Subtypes I’ve noticed - The Outplayers and the Co-Ops.

Outplayers are the Controllers who have a kit to prevent the spike from being defused and or planted to begin with. This description fits Astra and Omen. Astra’s pull and concussive abilities are enough to prevent enemies from wanting to finish the defuse on the first touch, or even the plant. Meanwhile, you hear an Omen tp that ain’t your team’s? Yeah, double check the site for a little shadow and then you’ll try aga— Why can’t I see or hear?

Co-Ops belong to Brim and Viper. You need to coordinate with your team to have these agents work and excel in their roles. Viper’s lineups require post plant and keeping her safe till then. Brim’s stim and setup for post plant require his team too!

I’d love to have a discussion on this with y’all! Let me know what you think!",1641146993

VALORANT,2022,1,"So I just started playing the game about a few weeks ago. I know basically what I'm doing, but the one thing that I've always noticed after my matches is that I have so many assists. 

For a specific example, my KDA was 15/18/20. No one I know has that high of an assist count, and I was wondering if that's a bad thing. 

I've been maining Raze if that helps. If it also helps, I've never played any games but platformers before this.",1641147166

For my list of questions I would rather have an honest answer but would like to know why you think that way, thank you.  


1. Is RNG spraying okay?
2. Are molly line-ups that make bomb-defusing impossible okay? Would adding sky collisions be better for the game?
3. What do you find the most annoying and broken in the current state of valorant.
4. Do you think Valorant is a good game, casually and competitively
5. What makes a game competitive 
6. Just for fun, what do you think Neon's Abilities will be, and will it be balanced?

VALORANT,2022,1,"So Deathmatch has always been something thats been complained about since the day its come out, and for good reason, its embarrassing that this version of deathmatch made it to a public build of the game, its really REALLY bad.

However some of the ""fixes"" I see suggested in this sub are mind boggling. Such as:

""Deathmatches need less people"" ????. Have you never even played a minute on split or breeze? You spend more times on those maps appreciating the scenery than actually fighting other players.

""They need to fix getting killed from behind"". There is no way to fix this, suck it up, it happens in CS too. The problem arises when there's a 3 second respawn timer and you don't actually fight anyone because riot has weird fixed spawns that spawn people in corners instead of where the actual action is.

Here is what I propose: 12-20 players depending on map size (ascent does NOT need 20 people lmfao).

24/7 servers with people being able to join mid DM. Remove the radar and leaderboard.

Make footsteps only audible when a player is in your immediate vicinity.

AR'S AND OPS ONLY, sorry if your are a judge god or spectre warrior but no one else is tryna deal with that we just want to warm up our aim.

Pistol only/Garduin Only servers.

MAP SELECTOR (id rather enter the draft than play DM on Fracture ever again).

Remove respawn timer and add random spawns/remove some of the headass spawns, stop spawning me in T spawn or in some random cubby in mid, I wanna be in the action.",1641154675

VALORANT,2022,1,"I want to know who to main and what class I should (duelist,controller ,etc) without spending that much money ,personally I've been playing omen but since his nerf he's not been that powerful and other controllers can do things better than him. I don't know if this would help but guns I like are the phantom, the awp (trying to improve with it I'm rubbish) the sherrif and the ghost. I do enjoy now but there are my top guns. I'm not confident at smoking or rushing because if I do i typically because I'm the range of enemy's sight, so I'll die immediately but if I flank my teammates are mostly dead.  Also to note my aim is rubbish because I try go body shots because I'm not confident at headshots and I still need to learn spray patterns or learn how to burst shots, If you need anymore info I'll try answer in the comments.  Im not sure if any of this could help but if it does your welcome",1641171358

VALORANT,2022,1,"I am level 30, started playing in November and I've played almost 200 normal games for now but still haven't played a single ranked game. I'm not new to this kind of games, I've been playing several FPS games for years now, it's that I feel like ranked gives too much pressure/anxiety. Am I the only one who only plays normal games? Also, I play this game in a Casual way, I am mostly a single player gamer.",1641173485
