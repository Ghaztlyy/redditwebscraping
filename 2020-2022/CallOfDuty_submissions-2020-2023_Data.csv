CallOfDuty,2020,1,"Topic.
Put your own strategy below for good strategy ~round by round.
 Feel free to copy/alter all this and make a better/updated list.
 Please, I want someone to make a better list! üòå
Reword it however you like, just a shout out would be cool. 
Ill link a revised topic later on if enough conments.
Will post on other cod reddits to get as much info.

 Wishlist for the post:
 *Amounts of ammo for wall guns with extended Mags (every wall gun SHOULD have it on).
 *amount of zombies for all rounds.
 *amount of points for the buff machine to buy 3 skills to 5.
 *tutorial for easter egg.
 *explain more optimal strats. 
 (don't be a dick/immature bois....)

 Going to explain mine, 0 mystery box required:

 ‚óèPre round 1: 
 Yup, stuff to do before the match even begins!

 *you spawn facing North, so things will make sense when I say certain directions.

 *look to the right the upper-level wooden wall/door where the elevator and msmc are.
 Sometimes a part spawns in the corner there.

 *Spend your 500 how you like, IMO tiers
 1. AK74.
 A good choice. Can build points pretty well with it.
 30/180 isn't too shabby vanilla.
 Recommend fast mags or extended mags for it.
 Fast mags bring reload speed back to normal, and extended mags give you some extra ammo.


 2. Quick revive
 My personal pic, if so I don't forget.
 Makes revival actually possible.
 ...even if players bleed out much faster than console COD.
 Remember: you can't revive someone who is in water.

 3. Coin machine.
 Good in a few rounds when you are set up, but too early to get.
 Pass, for now.
 There is one on both floors and in each hut.

 4. JL revolver. Outclassed, maybe to flex with rare one or fun, but otherwise, pass.

 5. Sticky bombs.
 Those are 2000 points! Too much for now.
 Trip mines are better IMO.

 Spending no points is a legitimate reason as well, mw11 can carry you to box/wall gun.

 ‚óèRound 1:you will be building points, nothing spectacular, maybe doing the above.

 ‚óèRound 2: same as round 1, building points.
 You can Early open the stairs or wooden door/gate/wall/wtf you wanna call it.
 I'll recommend staying if you are playing with randoms.
 You can do it if you want to sacrifice your 500 buy, to get your other 3 teammates kitted/suited up early.


 ‚óèRound 3:
 *Now is the time to usually open the stairs or wooden door/gate/wall/wtf you wanna call it.
 You may have to bite the bullet yourself if you want the opening you want.
 Want the stairs? Random teammates will pop stairs during rounds 3 or 4.
 Want gate-wall? You will especially HAVE to open this by yourself.
 Most people are flexible.

 *look for extra parts to repair the elevator.
 There is no zip line on this Shi no Numa.
 There are instead parts which are a pile of gears and bolts that you can pick up on shelves around the main center hut.
 Once you find the 2 parts, You then go to where the zipline used to be and repair the elevator.
 It leads to the underground lab and has 2 extra perk machines and you can complete the easter egg to fight a different boss. 
 Recommend coming after round 5, having 5k points coming down here, and when a round is winding down with less than 10 zombies left.


 *You can buy many more things:


 Trip mines:
 If you have spare 4000 points sure go ahead but not 100% needed.
 It can be bice to toss into crowds of zacks / while running back to buy more wall gun ammo.

 BL pump shotgun: it can be fun but very impractical. Pass.

 HG40: it's okay to build points but outclasses by ak74 and MSMC.
 Pass.

 MSMC: best wall gun here.
 48/304 ammo with extended mags.
 Great point generator gun.
 Its damage drops off in later rounds but it will hold you to a later gun.


 Mystery box:
 You could get lucky and get an RPD and not need a wall gun or a ray gun and make dog rounds/sub-bosses/ final boss irrelevant, but the problem is EVERYONE ELSE is too.
 Save your points for....

 Buff machine:
 A point sink.
 Kinda like much more expensive perks but you keep them if you respawn via the timer.
 Very useful and if you are ignoring the box make some wall guns as good if not better than Ray gun.
 Buy the headshot/reload and flat damage buffs. 3rd is up to you:

 Chain kill damage bonus is the best choice but survival is sometimes better.

 Health bonus is nice, can do more reckless training spots.

 Auto electric cherry if hit is pretty nifty.
 Stuns zeds trying to hit you from behind is quite helpful.

 Extra movent speed is nice but more are needed/better. Pass.

 ‚óèRound 4:

 *Should be gathering points to, if not open the flogger door and fish farm door by end of the round.
 Makes for a great escape route if randoms are struggling.
 Can now turn on the flogger which is the only trap IMO that is practical.
 Electrical traps are too risky and 

 Time to grab your 1st perk and the PDW.
 PDW is so damn good.
 Use extended mags / stock / fmj
 With extended mags, it has a whopping 68 round magazine!
 68/484? That 500 rounds of ammo!

 Purchasing ammo during a round can be quite hard and risky, but doable.

 *Very late to open doors, and bad if it happens.

 *Start rant:
 ....and this is when zombies will spawn everywhere.
 Oh and on all rounds, if you run too far away from zoms, they will respawn.

 As an old zombie player, I don't like it but I guess that's why modding exists for black ops 3.....üëÄü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
 So other than points, barriers are near worthless.
 /rant.


 ‚óèRound 5:
 Dogs.
Can train a huge pile of them and gun them down.
You prolly need the points.
Also in later dog rounds can flogger them to death.



 ‚óèRound 6: ‚óèRound 7: ‚óèRound 8:
*You will be opening the other 3 huts for other good wall guns and perks, go at the last few Zombies and in between rounds getting the other 2 perks in the underground lab.
Possibly having to trigger the easter egg by yourself too.


 ‚óèRound 9:
 Sub boss zombies will now spawn.
 They can be annoying but easy enough to deal with.
 ‚óèRound 10: 

‚óèRound 11: same as last rounds

 ‚óèRound 12: if you want to spin the box, this is a good time to do it.
Just save a zom to kite around and let randoms get box spins to get ray guns/good guns/buff station.

 *Before the boss fight, you should have all perks, 3 buff abilities to 5 and possibly a few more, and don't forget to snag a coin for the boss fight.

 ‚óèRound 13/boss fight:
 (i see what you did there devs....)
 Keep backpedaling, and dodging regular zombies and keep shooting.
 You will win.",1577840525

CallOfDuty,2020,1,"So as it's the new year, I've got a question, it is pretty much all but confirmed that Treyarch is making this year's COD, after a series of unfortunate events involving Sledgehammer and Raven.

What would you want this year though? Would you want

&amp;#x200B;

1. Black Ops V set in Vietnam?
2. Black Ops Reboot?
3. World At War Reboot?
4. A completely new franchise?
5. Delay this year's game?
6. Cancel this year's game?
7. That Treyarch stop making games altogether?

The last one a lot of people suggested to me about Sledgehammer, for Sledgehammer to ""Stop Making Games because they are bad"".

It is the new year and Treyarch didn't really tweet anything, meaning we'll have to wait until February to learn more about the game.

IMO I wish it would be Black Ops Reboot set in Vietnam. Possibly Black Ops V though.

P.S: On a side note, do you think all the characters of Black Ops except Woods should be recasted? Logically it would make sense because of the MW Reboot and Sam Worthington is busy working on Avatar 2, and Gary Oldman is just so busy.",1577889273

CallOfDuty,2020,1,"There have been 16 main COD's until today, ranging from the original Call of Duty until Modern Warfare. Some of those games are dropping a ton on active playerbase (for example, World at War and Ghosts)

Something curious that the Titanfall community did was to dedicate a week or two in the month of October/November calling it the ""Titanfall Week"" where they agreed as a community to be present during those days on Titanfall 1 and 2 as a method for players to have an easier time with matchmaking.

This ""community event"" worked. Titanfall 2's playerbase increased by 50% during that/those week(s) and players could confirm that they had an much easier time finding games.

This got me thinking that we could probably do the same within the Call of Duty games. Dedicating one or two weeks for each COD game during the year could not only make it easier for players to find matches but for also to populate dead playlists in every game.

For example:

- Days 1-10 of January: COD/COD2 and COD3


- Days 20-30 of January: COD4, MWR and WAW


- Days 10-20 of February: MW2 and BO


- Days 1-10 of March: MW3 and BO2


- Days 20-30 of March: Ghosts and AW


- Days 10-20 of April: BO3 and IW


- Days 1-10 of May: WWII and BO4


- Days 20-30 of May: MW and [Insert 2020 COD here]


Them, we could repeat the same starting in the month of July

The current COD will always have more players than the others and this is an opportunity to try to shift some players to different COD's for a limited time to temporarily increase the playerbase of each. And, most importantly, every COD game gets a chance to shine.

I play black ops 2 on ps3 every once in a while and a few months ago i was in a game with some dude who was yelling into his mic and j told him to be quieter (jokingly) and he got mad and said some stuff about ""what happens to people who tell him to shut up"" then he said ""their playstation freezes just like this"" then my whole console froze and i had to restart it and ever since then every time i try to open black ops 2 my console freezes. I even tried making a new psn account and it worked once but it still freezes whenever i try to open it while signed into any psn account since then. The disk is fine and every other game ive tried runs fine on the console. Does anyone know what this dude did or if theres any way to fix it?

Is this a play style I'm not aware of? So we go on to get swept by the opposing team because nobody knew what to do. I get that sometimes the other squad's skill is better than the other, I am a noob myself but it felt like everyone just wanted to get a kill and forgot about the objective.

For me in the series, this means avoiding light machine guns and preferring perks/attachments that improve handling and speed. I never use launchers on players, only when streaks annoy me. I was watching the Shadow War DLC trailer again and saw a guy get blown up with an RPG, thinking to myself ""I wonder if there's a player out there who maybe isn't so great that relies on the RPG to get a few easy kills"".

So is there anyone here who uses LMGs because maybe they can't aim, or they just like big guns? I'm just curious for people's weird (to me) but legitimate loadout ideas.",1578036499

CallOfDuty,2020,1,"Mine is Black Ops. Going back to it over the last 1.5 years I think there isn‚Äôt enough replayability compared to Black Ops 3 for example. There‚Äôs more weapon variety, more attachment options, more overall class set ups, more streak variety. Powerful streaks specifically is a big part of COD for me. Black Ops only has Blackbird Chopper Dogs combo. BO2 has the same thing with a Lodestar and Swarm+Dogs. BO3 has Mothership+Raps and Wraith HATR Raps. Should have added a powerful AI air streak. Lots of guns are clones of each other, Famas and AUG, Galil Commando AK47, 74u and MP5, MPL Specture Kirapis. Blind Eye shouldn‚Äôt be apart of Ghost Pro, Hard Wired should be a perk. I know a lot of people don‚Äôt like high flinch which this game has, all the old CODs do but it didnt stand out until BO which had a longer TTK than the other 3 with stopping power/less recoil. I don‚Äôt care about flinch as much but I‚Äôd reduce/remove that too. Another thing is that 6v6 TDM is too slow sometimes for whatever reason(s), during the evening I get faster paced lobbies",1578070971

If I recall correctly, I did hear some weird sounds, something like static, but it was barely audible. Actually scared me enough to make me close the game early, lol. I was wondering if anybody else has experienced something similar or if there's a known cause.",1578092379

Reload time is a little slow but faster than other LMGs and you can equip extended mags and it 60 rounds to greatly diminish that drawback. Recoil is moderate just like the ARs.

2) Despise that weapon and try to have a fair fight against its users using my fair/underpowered weapons, only accepting defeat if they beat me with it fairly instead of cheesing it (IE, BO2 870 up close, any shotgun would kill you that close, can't complain) or if my underpowered weapon is the reason I lost (I can't expect to get a quad kill with the BO1 Skorpion against a room full of shotgun/quickscoping campers, even with extended mags, I know my skill level isn't that high unless I get lucky once every 100 matches).


3) Get tired of too many consecutive deaths one game because of the OP weapon, decide to use it just to have a chance.


4) Get the OP weapon to max rank and unlock most/all camos for it.


5) Never use it again unless it's another game of people taking advantage of the OP weapon.",1578173086

CallOfDuty,2020,1,"A few months ago, I was watching a YouTube video about what minigames the creators of the YouTube channel wanted to be made into spin-off game. My mind went instantly to the strike force missions from Black Ops 2. Even though they didn't cover it, I was still thinking, I want the strike force missions to become a spin-off game.

 I liked how the developers perfectly combined gameplay elements from Call of Duty and gameplay elements of strategy games to make a great tactical shooting experience. For those who never played the strike force missions you took control of the regular units like the normal soldiers, and drones such as one that was a drone helicopter with a gun mounted on it, one that was like a tank, and one that was basically an rc car with a gun and rockets mounted on it. With these soldiers and drones you could order them to move to specific areas of the map using a tactical view of the map and take control of them directly. It's like Total War, except you can play as your soldiers. 

I know it's not for everyone who plays Call Of Duty, but I'd like to see the strike force missions turned into a real game and I want to know if anyone agrees.",1578217876

In my opinion, I think it would rejuvenate older games with a more hefty population.  Considering how crossplay works very well in Modern Warfare (2019), why not offer the same to most of the older titles?  Granted, some 360 versions would not really benefit too much considering the population is too low, along with the insane number of hackers on PS3/360.

- Since Treyarch supposedly had to pick up the pieces according to leaks, it gives them an extra year to polish their game.

- Next gen consoles will be coming out shortly after the game‚Äôs release. I feel like a lot of Call of Duty: Ghosts failure was because of this. It split the player base up, it made the game look worse, and feel clunkier. It was all around more difficult to play due to upgrading to a new console a week after its release.

- if Modern Warfare‚Äôs supposed to have the most content ever, there shouldn‚Äôt be a new title this October/November if that‚Äôs true.

This will never happen because Activision wants as much money as possible, but it would be best for the player base if they waited until 2021 to release Black Ops 5 and skip the usual yearly release.",1578374111

CallOfDuty,2020,1,"The P99 was the best sidearm in its debut game, Modern Warfare 3, without a shadow of doubt.  It had a max 1200 RPM, 49 damage, which is the same as the .44 Magnum *and* MP412, along with basically zero recoil and a huge magazine.  Easily the best sidearm, if you had the trigger finger for it.

It had a fast reload on top of a fast draw/ADS time with amazing iron sights to boot.  It was easily the best secondary in the game and you can't convince me otherwise.  

Because of this, I think it should've made a return in MW2019.  Unlike most other ""one-offs"" like the CM901, which was outclassed by every other assault rifle in MW3, the P99 was actually really good.  I think it would've been cool to see it return, especially since other good one offs(guns featured in one game) like the Intervention, made a return in the form of a classic weapon in Infinite Warfare, making it no longer a one off.  The P99 has only been in MW3, whereas worse handguns, like the Five Seven and USP .45 have been in multiple games at this point.

Using the MW3 stats, the P99 is also better than every single handgun *except* the D'eagle, and would've given another viable option in a game severely lacking in choice of handguns.  Also it just looked cool

tl;dr the P99 was the best secondary in MW3, and for a plethora of reasons it deserved to be featured in MW2019",1578401180
CallOfDuty,2020,1,"(Multiplayer guns: Wunderwaffe, Jet Gun or any other wonder weapon wouldn't really count)

I ask too many questions on these pages. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

&amp;nbsp;

Very unpopular opinion, but from what I can think of, my favourite is the HBRa3 Insanity from AW. Almost unstoppable with amped damage and fire rate.

I'm sure I prefer another gun somewhere, but that's all I could think of at the time of making this.",1578402284

CallOfDuty,2020,1," 

If Black Ops V does exist, I was thinking about what song might be in the trailer, if it is a Vietnam War game as expected. Then here are a few choices.

1. Hocus Pocus, by Focus: I know it's a bit overused, being in Robocop and Baby Driver as well as the Onward Trailer. But it is technically a Vietnam War era song. Yes it has a part that sounds like Quagmire from Family Guy singing, but I think it would make a good trailer song.
2. Black and White by The Stranglers.
3. Black Betty.
4. Black by Pearl Jam.

I don't know any others, but I'd really like a Vietnam War Era song or a song similar to ""Paint It Black"" ""Back in Black"" that has the word ""Black"" in it. Similar to previous trailers.",1578420470

Even with the removal of aim assist, there were plenty of quickscopers demolishing lobbies, while you see a game like battlefield where there's little to no quickscopers. Is there a specific answer? I think it may be because of the scope-in time? Or is it something else? Thanks.",1578422459

I know this question haha been asked several times before but it‚Äôs 2020 now so maybe BO4 Zombies has gotten better. I‚Äôd just like to play some casual zombies with my gf local co-op split screen and was wondering which one would be better for PS4. 

They‚Äôre both around $23, either BO3 w Zombie Chronicles, or BO4. 

It looks like the general consensus is 3 is better and has more content, but some were hoping 4 would get better. I haven‚Äôt kept up with COD in a while so I don‚Äôt know if it ever got better. I probably last played BO3 on PS3 a long time ago.

CallOfDuty,2021,1,"Just won my first match of COD: Mobile, of both the new year and just time in general. 

The best approach is an AR, and a Sniper, keep only the ammo you need and always finish your kills. Use the ninja kit and if you are with a teammate try to get them to use medic. 

The ninja helps you escape/zone better and faster, while the medic will heal after damage taken. Sound will distract you, so turn the sound off and use the top compass and the map to guide you. When sound is non existent your eyes work better and are more awake, and are less prone to miss enemies and loot. 

Reflex sights on guns are just distracting, as you have to look at a red dot on a square, while with the iron sights you need to line it up, using more concentration. Avoid thermal scopes if you can, as that may highlight the target but yet again, it‚Äôs distracting and makes you more prone to losing sight of a target, due to the highlights and the zoom the target can slip through blind spots. 

Hope this helps, and happy new year",1609465361

Now I'm going through a Veteran playthrough of this game, and also keeping in mind the mission-specific trophies (and intel) at the same time, all in order to get the platinum.

So I've destroyed, at least what I believe to be, all the vehicles/people on vehicles throughout the mission, but I'm not getting the trophy. I've looked up guides only to find it was a hotly contested debate back in 2010 about where the trophy actually begins, whether it be from when you start off on foot, or when you start on the motorcycle, or finally some saying it starts when you get on the back of the truck.

But either way, like I said, all of the guides and whatnot are from over a decade ago, and can't find anything from today, or recent. So my request here is, if someone could please test out if they can get the ""Vehicular Slaughter"" trophy (obviously on a new account, or at least one that doesn't already have it), and if you are successful in achieving it, please tell me how you got it, and where the trophy actually begins. Thanks.",1609496512

CallOfDuty,2021,1,"
mine are: (not included cod 1, 2, or 3) 


COD4: The G36C


buttery smooth and amazing with a suppressor, some of the best sights in the game


WAW: The Gewehr 43


no recoil and always a 3 shot, 1250 rpm cap making the gun fire as fast as i click the mouse (or pull the trigger)


MW2: The M4A1


yet again, buttery smooth with no recoil, a fast fire rate, and just my overall favorite. it slightly beats the TAR-21 for me


BO1: The g11


essentially the cod4 m16 with a built in extended mag and godly hip fire performance


MW3: The CM901


One of the most fun to use guns, alot of people make it out to be this impossible to use gun but the recoil is really easy and the fire rate is generous for the guns 2 shot potential 


BO2: The AN-94


the sexiest reload in bo2 and is one of the most risky due to the slow fire rate but the hyperburst makes thus gun a monster 


Ghost: The FAD


idk why i love this gun so much, one of my fav in all of cod. fast fire rate with a generous capacity and some sexy as fucc sights 


advanced warfare: The HBRA3


basically the same story as the an94. mediocre reload hut hot damn is this thing fun to use and powerful.


BO3: The KN-44


the most under appreciated gun in this game.  basically everything you'd want in an AR, the recoil isn't too hard either even with rapid fire which is aa must have 


IW: Type 2


3 words: Akimbo Submachine guns
otherwise the gun is pretty good, but the split pistols make this thing godly 


WW2: M1 Garand


not much to say, low recoil, decent fire rate, and always a 2 shot kill.


BO4: The Swordfish


i know its a tactical rifle but ill put it on here because i don't really like the bo4 ar's. 4 round burst monster with one of the best sites in the series.


MW2019: Ram-7


Fast TTK, easy recoil, and good sights, whats not to love? the movement is also pretty good 


bocw: The AK47


low recoil and high damage. whats not to love?


whats your guys list?",1609545173

CallOfDuty,2021,1,"Hey all,

Hopefully someone out there can help me. This Christmas a family member picked me up a Cosair VOID RGB ELITE Wireless headset which works perfectly with my PC. I have Cold War on PS4 and am running into an issue with the headset only in Cold War. The ps4 recognizes my headset. It's set as default for audio input/output. Works perfectly when I test it through the ps4 settings. In game, I can hear in-game sounds and others chatting. I can't for the life of me get my mic to work so I can talk to party members. When I use the test mic option in settings, the bar moves as if it's hearing my voice but I hear nothing and once I exit settings, if I try to talk to a party member, absolutely nothing, they can't hear me. I've updated the firmware on the headset, tried clearing the cache on the ps4, charged the headset fully, turned the sensitivity setting for my mic all the way up, and still nothing.... Am I missing something? Any help is appreciated. Thanks.",1609553435

CallOfDuty,2021,1," 

I'm trying to stream black ops 3 for PC on twitch but every time I start the game the stream quality drops a ton. I've tried going on local and I've searched google but I haven't found anything. I know it's not my internet because whenever I stream any other game/ content it works fine. What could the problem be?

Additional info (incase it helps):

I have the game on steam

the stream issues happen right when the game is started not before

when I close the game the stream quality shoots back up so I know it is black ops 3",1609571974

CallOfDuty,2021,1," Hey everyone. I was talking to a friend today, and we were talking about the funniest quotes in Zombies. I remembered that on BO1 Der Riese, maybe twice, i have gotten a quote from Tank where he says something like ""Hey Richtofen, this one's at the perfect height!"" when near both Richtofen and a crawler. And the odd part is, it doesn't sound like Steve's voice, but rather someone attempting to impersonate him. Does anyone else remember this quote or know if there is a story behind it? I think maybe a Dev snuck it in under the radar. Its super rare, ive maybe heard it 2-3 times. Just curious!",1609574010

Because let's be honest...the maps as a late especially new ones are not really that good... I mean just look at Piccadilly from Modern Warfare 2019..

They should have given the community a map editor so we can start creating our own maps and share it with the community 

I mean Fortnite has one don't you think the Call of duty Games should have one as well?

This should be for all platforms 

What do you think?

And if you can make a Call of duty Map how would you make it?

CallOfDuty,2021,1,"Not really used to posting on reddit, hopefully this is the right sub for stuff like this.  


Just recently i picked up BO2 after not playing its multiplayer for a while and decided to try the campaign mode again.  
I start from the very beginning and put it on ""Hardened"", Pyrrhic Victory and Celerium ran fine but in Old Wounds i encountered a bug that did not let me progress forward.  


The start of the mission runs fine, everything works up until the russians attack and you have to leave the city with a horse.  
Voicelines  took extremely long to load after that and sometimes loaded in all at the same time or didnt even load at all, music sometimes just stopped and didnt play again, i could feel my ps3 overheating or having trouble and if i quit out of the game it would stay in a black screen until i forcibly removed the disk from my PS3 Superslim.  


The worst part about this though is that even if i ignore the voicelines and the overheating, after taking down and defending some weapon cache and going back to the city, my game fades to black and the same distant explosion sound loops on seemingly forever (Altough one time i managed to get to a cutscene and then to some part where i destroy a tank, after that the distant explosion fade to black happened again)

I have already switched accounts and cleaned my disk, nothing helps. Other COD games seem to work fine and other games not related to COD work perfectly as well, i suspect this has something to do with the disc itself but i cant find anything relating to this online. If it helps, the disc is not scratched in any way, i dont even play the game that often so i dont really know what is wrong.",1609725468

The past for 4 CODs I have had a 3 K/D, with Cold War, and MW the community has been wanting SBMM to be removed. I just don't think it's as bad as it seems, the game has more issues than just SBMM, weapon balancing, poor map design, inconsistent spawns, poor visibility, scorestreaks. With all those negatives the game is fun though. I still hop on, and pub stomp, but when I do get matched against good players it reminds me of when I was playing BO4 league play at master division. idk SBMM isn't an issue for me, and I also don't like how everyone compares how they have one good game then they're playing against pros, most of you probably have no idea what it is like to play against a pro, for example the other day I was playing against Dashy (he is a pro player) he was using a 50 cal, and rpg dropped a 60 kills.

CallOfDuty,2022,1,"Let's be honest the system that we have in the past 3 games sucks... 


* After your first Prestige you're not rewarded for every level up you obtain 


* the matchmaking is strict so your going up against high ranking players all the time and its not fun

* Lobby's disband after every game 


* theres no option to search for Games based on your connection 



**HERE'S WHAT I WOULD CHANGE**

* just like in the old games is you choose to prestige you have to unlock everything just like in the original Game (except for weapon levels you keep all the attachments you've earned I have an idea for that)


* any future DLC weapons, perks, streaks, equipment are not be on the battle pass except it will be on a level in your prestige (so not only do you unlock everything again but you're always unlocking something new!)


* Have a Daily log in bonus 


* Have a friend referral system 


* Matchmaking would be incredible loose so you can play the game at your own pace 


* Have the option to either stay in the lobby or find a new lobby after a game 


* Weapons will have the ability to prestige and you reward for prestiging a weapon you can pick ANY camo or skin from previous games! 


* have the option to search for Games based on your connection quality (like the Search network preferences from Black ops 2)


and that's the changes I would make what would you change?",1641010598

CallOfDuty,2022,1,"My favorite Call Of Duty's pre-2013 are the original Modern Warfare, and MW2. For 3 specific reasons 

1. Memorable maps 

2. Pacing of TDM, and other multiplayer game modes 

3. Matches were actually memorable. I have distinct memories of SO many rounds of TDM. Either because I got a massive killstreak, there was an enemy I spent the whole round trying to kill, or because of team work with some random person on my team, etc 

And the reason why Cold War was so damn good to me, was because it ticks all three of those boxes. Something a Call Of Duty hasn't done for me since Black Ops 1. 

The pacing of TDM reminds me a lot of the old school Modern Warfare's, and I actually remember all of the maps even though I haven't played Cold War in 6+ months. 

Almost every other Call Of Duty released since 2013, I usually forget as soon as I move on to the next. I couldn't tell you the name of a single map. I probably only remember 1-2 maps per game, if that. And all rounds blend together, due to the fast pacing and lack of gameplay variety due to map design. 

What's your favorite Call Of Duty post-2013, and why?",1641051864

Is it a good idea to buy Call of Duty
games 2-3 years after their release ? Or
should I buy them at their release (but
resell them a year later (limited budget
for this))?

Does anybody feel that the weapon attachment system Modern Warfare (2019) introduced ruined call of duty?

Lets talk about having a default gun in Modern Warfare, with no attachments, Its dog water. But then compared to black ops 2 use a default gun and wipe the floor with it no problem.

The default gun in modern warfare is slow, unnacurate, basically unusable, it requires attachments to be good, and then you have attachments that affect weird mechanics like movement speed, slide speed, Vertical recoil and horizontal recoil, and especially AIM DOWN SIGHT SPEED. They slowed down the aim down sight speed on default guns on purpose to make them bad, and then had other attachments that could speed up and slow down ads speed as well. Its just a complicated mess.

I miss when gun attachments were simple like Bo2 and Mw2 and mw3 They need to bring it back",1641277567

CallOfDuty,2022,1,[removed],1641287546
CallOfDuty,2022,1,"Like many people I've grown up with CoD. Since I was at school with the release of OG games that put the series on the map (MW/MW2/BO/BO2/WaW) I've bought and played CoD. My whole school played these games, friends and family too. Lots of amazing memories around this game series. Lots of love. To some people, games are not ""just games"" they are vessels of entertainment and excitement that bring people enjoyment and memories together. I care deeply about Call of Duty.

But this franchise now imo is down in the dumps. Since Modern Warfare 2019 there's been a lot of things happen with this series that are negative. From games releasing with hundreds of bugs, some being game breaking, to games releasing with a lack of content, to games designed with a poor direction, to fan loved features being removed or butchered, poorly balanced games that primarily cause players frustration - just an overall lack of attention and lack of care. Completely ignoring customer feedback and fans as a whole.

After Advanced Warfare I gave the series a break as I gave gaming a break as a whole for a few years. I did eventually play some of the PS4 CoD games such as BO3 and BO4 once I got back into gaming, but the primary CoD game that got me back into CoD again like I was as a kid was Modern Warfare 2019. Considering this game is the best selling CoD game of all time, I'm sure this story is similar for a lot of CoD fans. The Modern Warfare name alone was a beacon to old time fans, signalling that the series was back but in full force ready to be THE shooter game to play again! But for me, my friends and many others, that's all it was - just a name.

Me and my friends came back to CoD with Modern Warfare 2019. We thought the revival would mean a reboot to modern day standards but with a similar gameplay direction. But what we found was a game that played nothing like the greats. Lobbies disbanding, no map votes, traditional Prestige system gone, frustrating camo grind, poor map design, gameplay ripped off from R6 Siege, poor visibility, a tonne of bugs, plus more.

Don't get me wrong, Modern Warfare 2019 brought a lot of good to the series and it's clear a lot of love was put into it, especially the art such as the animations and graphics - but it had a lot of issues. The pile of issues with this game caused me and most of my friends to hate it. They all stopped playing and thought they had been conned by the name, that it wasn't CoD anymore. I still kept playing as the only consistent pleasure I personally derived from playing Modern Warfare was grinding my aim/movement skills playing Shoot House and 3v3 Face Off daily. I felt the pace was fast and fun. I used these playlists to improve my overall CoD and FPS skills.

As a casual player it wasn't the most positive experience. For all the talk that goes on about casual players, at the time as a casual CoD player it certainly wasn't designed to make me keep playing. Casually trying to play the game like it was CoD4 was not a fun experience at all. Everyone had to switch up their playstyles to be much slower on most maps. The adrenaline pumping pace of CoD felt stripped away unless you were an extremely good player or the map was small.

Then we come to Black Ops Cold War. This again brought me and my friends in to play as it's a Black Ops game. We absolutely loved BO2 back on the PS3. We thought this would be equally and great if not better. But instead it launched with: even more bugs than Modern Warfare 2019, with very little content, an inconsistent and overall unfinished feeling gameplay direction, delay on League Play which in the end launched poorly, my CoD Points that I earned randomly disappearing and never coming back, had a lot of the same issues Modern Warfare 2019 had like disbanding lobbies, etc. Though the Zombies for me and my friends saved it. Having always loved Zombies in CoD, especially BO3 Zombie Chronicles DLC - it kept bringing me back.

Now comes to Vanguard. Only half my friends bought this game, the others gave up with CoD after Modern Warfare 2019 and Cold War - they felt CoD wasn't what it used to be. I did buy it as I'm still hooked. It's very clear to all now that the developers of CoD games have poor working conditions. These developers are overworked and have little time or even freedom to make a quality experience anymore. Activision are persistent at forcing these people to churn out a new CoD every year. To follow their 3 year development cycle to a T and shit out the game whether it's ready or not. Vanguard is easily the buggiest CoD game we've ever had. Many thought Cold War was unfinished, but boy does Vanguard take the cake! I've never played a CoD game this badly tested for bugs and glitches before! Not only that but all of the CoD games over the last few years (Modern Warfare, Cold War and Warzone) became broken after the Vanguard Season 1 update - Modern Warfare for a lot of people in UNPLAYABLE! Clearly there needs to be a change somewhere. This is unacceptable!

Excluding the bugs and glitches, Vanguard again is full of frustration. As much as I loved the feel and movement of Modern Warfare, outside of slide cancels being better balanced there's been no innovation from Modern Warfare. The destruction is lacklustre and buggy, mainly a distraction that gets in the way of core gameplay. The camo grind or grinding weapons in general is the worst it's ever been. Absolutely terrible balance. Not in the MW2 sense where 80% of stuff is overpowered therefore the overall balance isn't that bad, nah, in Vanguard about 40% of stuff is overpowered or broken, making the gameplay experience feel inconsistent and unrewarding. Outdated Killstreak system. The Zombies mode is the worst we've ever had in a CoD game, I have 0% interest in playing it until it's gotten the love it deserves with gameplay direction and content. Community feedback not being listened to as promised as per usual. No League Play at launch....

Speaking of League Play! Since Modern Warfare 2019 and trying to improve at CoD, I've gotten into CoD Comp. What seemed like a foreign and strange scene (largely because Activision puts zero effort incorporating Comp or making it appealing) is now my favourite part of CoD. But Activision spend no effort trying to grow the scene.

Everyone has to be listened to! Every community, that includes Comp. We can't kick Competitive lovers out on the curb. There was a lot of things that kicked off CoD's appeal back in the day and a big slice of that was the entertainment and competitive scene: from everyday players having the opportunity to grind their skill in tournaments to try and become a Pro to Pro players such as Scump giving CoD viewership through his videos and streams.

Now what do we have? There's no effort or incentives to help casuals get into Comp. There lacks proper structure for amateurs to clearly have a path towards becoming a Pro. There's no day 1 League Play to hook people into Comp from day 1, releasing it halfway through the life cycle is ridiculous. The League Play we do end up getting a la Cold War League Play was only loosely based on skill, the system itself was poor and didn't incentivise improving all that much because of no ELO. The CDL franchises have spent so much money yet neither Activision nor the developers have spent much effort at all trying to grow the scene at all. Games such as Apex, Rocket League, CS:GO, League of Legends, etc - all these games wouldn't be where they were without a rich competitive scene.

Activision and the developers themselves need to break out of this mental stigma they have that not focusing on eSports will make more money as casuals don't watch eSports. For all intents and purposes a huge catalogue of games on the market show this to be untrue. A good competitive scene competently structured to allow for growth will increase revenue massively. Right now, none of Activision are doing even 10% of what they could to both grow CoD Comp and therefore the CoD brand. They're simply content with relying on Warzone, being fully complacent with relying on a trending genre to keep the series afloat that may or may not be popular in the future.

Sorry for the large part about Comp if you're not into it, but this is a big part of what I love about this series and it's the same for other people too. This whole post is essentially my love letter to this series. I love it, just as I love GTA. It's brought me a lot of good memories and has a place in my gaming heart. But all good things must come to and end, that is if they're not maintained sufficiently. I now do not want to support this series anymore. Me and my friends have been burnt too much from the last 3 games to spend money and time on a game that primarily causes frustration and negative feelings.

I'm forcing myself to buy one last game to see if Activision and their developers change their ways. I'm putting all my trust and all my hope into Infinity Ward with Modern Warfare 2. If this game does not seek to fix the long-standing issues this series has and deliver a great CoD experience. If this game does not seek to launch in an acceptable, finished state. If this game does not treat the Comp scene with respect and try to grow it. If this game does not reignite love for this series anymore. Then I'm done. I can no longer buy the games anymore. I'm a very loyal gamer. If I love a game series, I will do everything I can to support it. I'm the type of person to have bought GTA V with every release (PS3, PS4 and PC) and soon to be PS5. It takes a lot for me to stop playing a game series, but if Modern Warfare 2 isn't the game it needs to be my loyalty is gone.

I sincerely hope Activision opens their eyes and makes change to restore this series to its former glory again. I really do hope Infinity Ward will knock it out of the park next year! Please, this is my last hope for this series!",1641289042

I used to play COD 5 **\[WAW\]** on my PlayStation 2 when i was a kid, and I have lots of memories with it. I recently discovered it is also offered on steam (PC).

are the 2 games the same? I couldn't find lots of gameplay footage on YouTube, and I wanted to make sure that the ps2 version and the pc version are the same.

The ps2 version begins with the main character drowning in mud during training, and once pulled out the actual battle begins.

CallOfDuty,2022,1,"Upset by treyarchs new games, and fuelled by passionate nostalgia I want to start playing black ops 2 again. 

1) My ps3 power cord is lost so I don't wanna have to find that
2) my pc can't run bo2
3) Xbox has backwards compatibility so I can play on both of my xbox consoles.

These 3 facts make me want to play it on xbox rather than any other platform

So I was wondering, how is bo2 going on xbox? Would I be able to get lobby's consistently? I just want to go back man. Bo2 was the best.

I don't mind hackers. As long as there's some way I can play black ops 2. I miss the guns, the camo grind, the maps, the gameplay the scores scorestreaks the campaign I miss mason and Woods I miss everything I miss black ops 2 so much. So so so so much. I miss it like a widow who lost her husband of 50 years. It was my first cod game, and the first game I ever played online. One of the first games I was addicted to.

As long as i can get some lobby's. Please give me good news.",1641334692

CallOfDuty,2022,1,"Call Of Duty 1, 2 and 3 are the best in my opinion.

So let's start with Call of Duty 1:

Campaign:

The campaign is pretty good, it has a good story, a lot of memorable moments and it isn't too unrealistic, so you can still take it seriously.

Multiplayer:

While the multiplayer is dead today, but Call of Duty 3 isn't that dead, if you're lucky you can find some lobbies, and if you're really lucky, a full lobby, but it's fun, it isn't unfair, and from my experience there are no cheaters, and maybe there were some back in the day, but it's really hard to find one today.

Also the multiplayer stayed about the same for the first 2 Call of Duties, so I'm gonna write multiplayer just for this one and 3, but it was pretty good.

Call of Duty 2:

Campaign:

Same feelings as Call of duty 1, but more memorable and fun,  I consider this the best Call of Duty Campaign.

Call of duty 3:

Campaign:

While not as memorable as the other 2 Call of Duties, still a good game, with better gameplay and a little longer missions.

Multiplayer:

As I said it's not that dead, but in my opinion Call of Duty 1 and 2 were better, even with a full lobby it's sometimes hard to find players to shoot at, and also it added the reason I don't like the battlefield games much, vehicles, if the other team has a good tank driver, then you're gonna get absolutely fucked by the other team.

Now let me tell you why I dislike every call of duty game since then.

As a WW2 games fan I wasn't too excited to try the campaign of Modern Warfare as most military shooters aren't too good, but I did, and while better than most other military games, I felt that it was too irrealistic for the more realistic approach they were going for also the multiplayer died for me in this game, you didn't have all weapons unlocked, the ones that you had weren't good, and you had to level up to unlock weapons, I would be ok with this if it was treated differently, because unless you were playing since day 1, you're not gonna get anywhere, I know it's supposed to be rewarding, but after spending hundreds of hours trying to get to level 20, it isn't so rewarding, then the perks, this is the most frustrating aspect of every game after this for me they give you too many benefits, there are also cheaters to this day, and at the end the combat encounters are decided by who has the best gun, not the best skill, also a problem for leveling up, but it still can be enjoyable at times.

Then Call of Duty World at War, better than Modern Warfare but not better than Call of Duty 2, campaign was good, not so good, the multiplayer was the same, and since then every campaign was ridiculous, and for me not enjoyable, and the multiplayer, even tough they've tried to change it, they just make it worse.

Also if you want better WW2 games, play the Medal of Honor games.",1641394643

CallOfDuty,2022,1,"I know this will get downvoted to oblivion but hear me out on this

As you may know mw2 is the most popular and best rated in the series but there is something I don‚Äôt like about it and that is the seriousness with it.

As many people will ask what does it do with the game is. And I will answer that cod has been and always been for the veteran who died in wars but I think mw2 changed that to endless shooting and bad Russians this is the thing that I don‚Äôt like I wanted it to be serious like the previous games for example compare cod4 trailer to mw2‚Äôs. cod4 trailer is serious and storytelling and mw2‚Äôs trailer is shooting and exploding and Eminem raping in the background this is number one the other is storytelling and timing what I mean is in cod4 you have missions that stops the shooting action a bit for example all ghillied up and the president view but in mw2 you got shooting bad Russians shooting bad Russians again with the world most accurate glock 17 that what I‚Äôm say and with the storytelling the same thing shooting Russian because they are bad. The third thing the different with a man in the army and one man army. Spoilers with this one but hear me out in cod4 at the end of the game when you takeout the main villain you don‚Äôt stand up and take him head on the friendly Russians made him and his men look the other way so you can get a clean shoot the thing is you won‚Äôt win without them if they were not there the villain would just kill you like gaz and the others. In the other hand mw2 made you kill Brazil bad guys by yourself this is what I. Mean I don‚Äôt hate it because cause it‚Äôs a sequel to a masterpiece this are just my opinion and it‚Äôs okay to disagree but I‚Äôd like to hear what opinion you have on mw2 instead of death threats.",1641423613

And if you want to make it change and give the developers idea of what we want

If you're in a group, a YouTuber, a streamer and so on 

Have everyone play the old golden era games from CoD 4 up to Black ops 2 

And do not play Modern Warfare 2019, Black Ops Cold War, and Vanguard

And continued do that if there's very little players or no players play in the recent free titles and just go back to the old game

It will probably teach the developers of what they should learn about the old CoD games and what made them great to begin with

CallOfDuty,2022,1,"Wondering how playable every COD is as I‚Äôve a nostalgic itch to go back and play them. So I thought I‚Äôd see what people‚Äôs opinions are on the state of every COD game in 2022!

I‚Äôm specifically talking about a COD‚Äôs multiplayer and in regards to:

1. if it is easy to get into a game (for simplicities sake, just a game of team deathmatch)

2. if the game is playable (not the about mechanics of the game, you‚Äôre entitled to your own opinion about if a COD is good or not, I mean can you get into a game of multiplayer and will there be a game breaking BUG or a cheater)

3. on console (since there‚Äôs more of a chance of getting into a game, though if there‚Äôs an active PC community feel free to chime in!) 

So, whatever COD games you have played recently, mark how playable their MP is out of 10. 10 meaning works like a charm, 1 being legitimately unplayable

For example, MW19 is a 1 because I literally cannot load into MP. CW would be a 9/10 because it functions and has a good player base. Black Ops 2 would be a 4 because I can get into a game after a while but it‚Äôll most likely have a cheater. Warzone is probably at a 6/7 with the current bugs

Jot down what COD MPs and rank how playable they are! Interested to see what people have to say :)",1641497934

CallOfDuty,2022,1,"And why?    

[Tl;Dr at bottom]    

I've been wondering recently; I've heard mostly bad things about them but I'm obviously curious after playing 11 of them, since BO1 (ignoring CoD 4 original and minus MW2 multiplayer and MW3). I obviously bought Ghosts, AW, IW; despite hearing bad things about them as I'm in general a fan of the series.

I know there's been *a bit of a rough patch* for a while bit there's still hope in my heart there will be a good game (even with SBMM maybe?).

I enjoyed MW2019 a lot, especially at release but I noticed a deterioration in MP at release of Warzone and beyond. So I'm guessing the next two kinda pivot around this quality.

(Any questions, just reply)

Tl;Dr: Although I've heard bad things about the 2 games, I think they look good and want to keep up with the player-base.

Edit: I put both to see results as I forgot to put a 'Results' option.
