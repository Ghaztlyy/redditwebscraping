CallOfDuty,2020,1,"Topic.
Put your own strategy below for good strategy ~round by round.
 Feel free to copy/alter all this and make a better/updated list.
 Please, I want someone to make a better list! üòå
Reword it however you like, just a shout out would be cool. 
Ill link a revised topic later on if enough conments.
Will post on other cod reddits to get as much info.

 Wishlist for the post:
 *Amounts of ammo for wall guns with extended Mags (every wall gun SHOULD have it on).
 *amount of zombies for all rounds.
 *amount of points for the buff machine to buy 3 skills to 5.
 *tutorial for easter egg.
 *explain more optimal strats. 
 (don't be a dick/immature bois....)

 Going to explain mine, 0 mystery box required:

 ‚óèPre round 1: 
 Yup, stuff to do before the match even begins!

 *you spawn facing North, so things will make sense when I say certain directions.

 *look to the right the upper-level wooden wall/door where the elevator and msmc are.
 Sometimes a part spawns in the corner there.

 *Spend your 500 how you like, IMO tiers
 1. AK74.
 A good choice. Can build points pretty well with it.
 30/180 isn't too shabby vanilla.
 Recommend fast mags or extended mags for it.
 Fast mags bring reload speed back to normal, and extended mags give you some extra ammo.


 2. Quick revive
 My personal pic, if so I don't forget.
 Makes revival actually possible.
 ...even if players bleed out much faster than console COD.
 Remember: you can't revive someone who is in water.

 3. Coin machine.
 Good in a few rounds when you are set up, but too early to get.
 Pass, for now.
 There is one on both floors and in each hut.

 4. JL revolver. Outclassed, maybe to flex with rare one or fun, but otherwise, pass.

 5. Sticky bombs.
 Those are 2000 points! Too much for now.
 Trip mines are better IMO.

 Spending no points is a legitimate reason as well, mw11 can carry you to box/wall gun.

 ‚óèRound 1:you will be building points, nothing spectacular, maybe doing the above.

 ‚óèRound 2: same as round 1, building points.
 You can Early open the stairs or wooden door/gate/wall/wtf you wanna call it.
 I'll recommend staying if you are playing with randoms.
 You can do it if you want to sacrifice your 500 buy, to get your other 3 teammates kitted/suited up early.


 ‚óèRound 3:
 *Now is the time to usually open the stairs or wooden door/gate/wall/wtf you wanna call it.
 You may have to bite the bullet yourself if you want the opening you want.
 Want the stairs? Random teammates will pop stairs during rounds 3 or 4.
 Want gate-wall? You will especially HAVE to open this by yourself.
 Most people are flexible.

 *look for extra parts to repair the elevator.
 There is no zip line on this Shi no Numa.
 There are instead parts which are a pile of gears and bolts that you can pick up on shelves around the main center hut.
 Once you find the 2 parts, You then go to where the zipline used to be and repair the elevator.
 It leads to the underground lab and has 2 extra perk machines and you can complete the easter egg to fight a different boss. 
 Recommend coming after round 5, having 5k points coming down here, and when a round is winding down with less than 10 zombies left.


 *You can buy many more things:


 Trip mines:
 If you have spare 4000 points sure go ahead but not 100% needed.
 It can be bice to toss into crowds of zacks / while running back to buy more wall gun ammo.

 BL pump shotgun: it can be fun but very impractical. Pass.

 HG40: it's okay to build points but outclasses by ak74 and MSMC.
 Pass.

 MSMC: best wall gun here.
 48/304 ammo with extended mags.
 Great point generator gun.
 Its damage drops off in later rounds but it will hold you to a later gun.


 Mystery box:
 You could get lucky and get an RPD and not need a wall gun or a ray gun and make dog rounds/sub-bosses/ final boss irrelevant, but the problem is EVERYONE ELSE is too.
 Save your points for....

 Buff machine:
 A point sink.
 Kinda like much more expensive perks but you keep them if you respawn via the timer.
 Very useful and if you are ignoring the box make some wall guns as good if not better than Ray gun.
 Buy the headshot/reload and flat damage buffs. 3rd is up to you:

 Chain kill damage bonus is the best choice but survival is sometimes better.

 Health bonus is nice, can do more reckless training spots.

 Auto electric cherry if hit is pretty nifty.
 Stuns zeds trying to hit you from behind is quite helpful.

 Extra movent speed is nice but more are needed/better. Pass.

 ‚óèRound 4:

 *Should be gathering points to, if not open the flogger door and fish farm door by end of the round.
 Makes for a great escape route if randoms are struggling.
 Can now turn on the flogger which is the only trap IMO that is practical.
 Electrical traps are too risky and 

 Time to grab your 1st perk and the PDW.
 PDW is so damn good.
 Use extended mags / stock / fmj
 With extended mags, it has a whopping 68 round magazine!
 68/484? That 500 rounds of ammo!

 Purchasing ammo during a round can be quite hard and risky, but doable.

 *Very late to open doors, and bad if it happens.

 *Start rant:
 ....and this is when zombies will spawn everywhere.
 Oh and on all rounds, if you run too far away from zoms, they will respawn.

 As an old zombie player, I don't like it but I guess that's why modding exists for black ops 3.....üëÄü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
 So other than points, barriers are near worthless.
 /rant.


 ‚óèRound 5:
 Dogs.
Can train a huge pile of them and gun them down.
You prolly need the points.
Also in later dog rounds can flogger them to death.



 ‚óèRound 6: ‚óèRound 7: ‚óèRound 8:
*You will be opening the other 3 huts for other good wall guns and perks, go at the last few Zombies and in between rounds getting the other 2 perks in the underground lab.
Possibly having to trigger the easter egg by yourself too.


 ‚óèRound 9:
 Sub boss zombies will now spawn.
 They can be annoying but easy enough to deal with.
 ‚óèRound 10: 

‚óèRound 11: same as last rounds

 ‚óèRound 12: if you want to spin the box, this is a good time to do it.
Just save a zom to kite around and let randoms get box spins to get ray guns/good guns/buff station.

 *Before the boss fight, you should have all perks, 3 buff abilities to 5 and possibly a few more, and don't forget to snag a coin for the boss fight.

 ‚óèRound 13/boss fight:
 (i see what you did there devs....)
 Keep backpedaling, and dodging regular zombies and keep shooting.
 You will win.",2020-01-01 01:02:05

CallOfDuty,2020,1,"So as it's the new year, I've got a question, it is pretty much all but confirmed that Treyarch is making this year's COD, after a series of unfortunate events involving Sledgehammer and Raven.

What would you want this year though? Would you want

&amp;#x200B;

1. Black Ops V set in Vietnam?
2. Black Ops Reboot?
3. World At War Reboot?
4. A completely new franchise?
5. Delay this year's game?
6. Cancel this year's game?
7. That Treyarch stop making games altogether?

The last one a lot of people suggested to me about Sledgehammer, for Sledgehammer to ""Stop Making Games because they are bad"".

It is the new year and Treyarch didn't really tweet anything, meaning we'll have to wait until February to learn more about the game.

IMO I wish it would be Black Ops Reboot set in Vietnam. Possibly Black Ops V though.

P.S: On a side note, do you think all the characters of Black Ops except Woods should be recasted? Logically it would make sense because of the MW Reboot and Sam Worthington is busy working on Avatar 2, and Gary Oldman is just so busy.",2020-01-01 14:34:33

CallOfDuty,2020,1,"There have been 16 main COD's until today, ranging from the original Call of Duty until Modern Warfare. Some of those games are dropping a ton on active playerbase (for example, World at War and Ghosts)

Something curious that the Titanfall community did was to dedicate a week or two in the month of October/November calling it the ""Titanfall Week"" where they agreed as a community to be present during those days on Titanfall 1 and 2 as a method for players to have an easier time with matchmaking.

This ""community event"" worked. Titanfall 2's playerbase increased by 50% during that/those week(s) and players could confirm that they had an much easier time finding games.

This got me thinking that we could probably do the same within the Call of Duty games. Dedicating one or two weeks for each COD game during the year could not only make it easier for players to find matches but for also to populate dead playlists in every game.

For example:

- Days 1-10 of January: COD/COD2 and COD3


- Days 20-30 of January: COD4, MWR and WAW


- Days 10-20 of February: MW2 and BO


- Days 1-10 of March: MW3 and BO2


- Days 20-30 of March: Ghosts and AW


- Days 10-20 of April: BO3 and IW


- Days 1-10 of May: WWII and BO4


- Days 20-30 of May: MW and [Insert 2020 COD here]


Them, we could repeat the same starting in the month of July

The current COD will always have more players than the others and this is an opportunity to try to shift some players to different COD's for a limited time to temporarily increase the playerbase of each. And, most importantly, every COD game gets a chance to shine.

CallOfDuty,2020,1,"Most people on here probably dont play on ps3 still but i rarely play so i never could justify buying a new console. I play black ops 2 on ps3 every once in a while and a few months ago i was in a game with some dude who was yelling into his mic and j told him to be quieter (jokingly) and he got mad and said some stuff about ""what happens to people who tell him to shut up"" then he said ""their playstation freezes just like this"" then my whole console froze and i had to restart it and ever since then every time i try to open black ops 2 my console freezes. I even tried making a new psn account and it worked once but it still freezes whenever i try to open it while signed into any psn account since then. The disk is fine and every other game ive tried runs fine on the console. Does anyone know what this dude did or if theres any way to fix it? Or if these continued problems are related to the incident a few months ago??",2020-01-02 23:49:46

CallOfDuty,2020,1,"So I got in a Search and Destroy lobby today, I like the mode because of its different playstyle among others, so I hop on as the attacking team and when I spectate my teammates I realize everyone is camping or looking for kills, even the bomb carrier wouldn't go for the objective when it was clear. 
 
Is this a play style I'm not aware of? So we go on to get swept by the opposing team because nobody knew what to do. I get that sometimes the other squad's skill is better than the other, I am a noob myself but it felt like everyone just wanted to get a kill and forgot about the objective.

I was watching the Shadow War DLC trailer again and saw a guy get blown up with an RPG, thinking to myself ""I wonder if there's a player out there who maybe isn't so great that relies on the RPG to get a few easy kills"".

So is there anyone here who uses LMGs because maybe they can't aim, or they just like big guns? I'm just curious for people's weird (to me) but legitimate loadout ideas.",2020-01-03 07:28:19

CallOfDuty,2020,1,"Mine is Black Ops. Going back to it over the last 1.5 years I think there isn‚Äôt enough replayability compared to Black Ops 3 for example. There‚Äôs more weapon variety, more attachment options, more overall class set ups, more streak variety. Powerful streaks specifically is a big part of COD for me. Black Ops only has Blackbird Chopper Dogs combo. BO2 has the same thing with a Lodestar and Swarm+Dogs. BO3 has Mothership+Raps and Wraith HATR Raps. Should have added a powerful AI air streak. Lots of guns are clones of each other, Famas and AUG, Galil Commando AK47, 74u and MP5, MPL Specture Kirapis. Blind Eye shouldn‚Äôt be apart of Ghost Pro, Hard Wired should be a perk. I know a lot of people don‚Äôt like high flinch which this game has, all the old CODs do but it didnt stand out until BO which had a longer TTK than the other 3 with stopping power/less recoil. I don‚Äôt care about flinch as much but I‚Äôd reduce/remove that too.

My mind went instantly to the strike force missions from Black Ops 2. Even though they didn't cover it, I was still thinking, I want the strike force missions to become a spin-off game.

 I liked how the developers perfectly combined gameplay elements from Call of Duty and gameplay elements of strategy games to make a great tactical shooting experience. For those who never played the strike force missions you took control of the regular units like the normal soldiers, and drones such as one that was a drone helicopter with a gun mounted on it, one that was like a tank, and one that was basically an rc car with a gun and rockets mounted on it. With these soldiers and drones you could order them to move to specific areas of the map using a tactical view of the map and take control of them directly. It's like Total War, except you can play as your soldiers. 

I know it's not for everyone who plays Call Of Duty, but I'd like to see the strike force missions turned into a real game and I want to know if anyone agrees.",2020-01-05 09:51:16

In my opinion, I think it would rejuvenate older games with a more hefty population.  Considering how crossplay works very well in Modern Warfare (2019), why not offer the same to most of the older titles?  Granted, some 360 versions would not really benefit too much considering the population is too low, along with the insane number of hackers on PS3/360.

- Since Treyarch supposedly had to pick up the pieces according to leaks, it gives them an extra year to polish their game.

- Next gen consoles will be coming out shortly after the game‚Äôs release. I feel like a lot of Call of Duty: Ghosts failure was because of this. It split the player base up, it made the game look worse, and feel clunkier. It was all around more difficult to play due to upgrading to a new console a week after its release.

- if Modern Warfare‚Äôs supposed to have the most content ever, there shouldn‚Äôt be a new title this October/November if that‚Äôs true.

This will never happen because Activision wants as much money as possible, but it would be best for the player base if they waited until 2021 to release Black Ops 5 and skip the usual yearly release.",2020-01-07 05:15:11

CallOfDuty,2020,1,"The P99 was the best sidearm in its debut game, Modern Warfare 3, without a shadow of doubt.  It had a max 1200 RPM, 49 damage, which is the same as the .44 Magnum *and* MP412, along with basically zero recoil and a huge magazine.  Easily the best sidearm, if you had the trigger finger for it.

It had a fast reload on top of a fast draw/ADS time with amazing iron sights to boot.  It was easily the best secondary in the game and you can't convince me otherwise.  

Because of this, I think it should've made a return in MW2019.  Unlike most other ""one-offs"" like the CM901, which was outclassed by every other assault rifle in MW3, the P99 was actually really good.  I think it would've been cool to see it return, especially since other good one offs(guns featured in one game) like the Intervention, made a return in the form of a classic weapon in Infinite Warfare, making it no longer a one off.  The P99 has only been in MW3, whereas worse handguns, like the Five Seven and USP .45 have been in multiple games at this point.

Using the MW3 stats, the P99 is also better than every single handgun *except* the D'eagle, and would've given another viable option in a game severely lacking in choice of handguns.  Also it just looked cool

tl;dr the P99 was the best secondary in MW3, and for a plethora of reasons it deserved to be featured in MW2019",2020-01-07 12:46:20

2. Black and White by The Stranglers.
3. Black Betty.
4. Black by Pearl Jam.

CallOfDuty,2020,1,"Call of Duty: Ghosts was certainly a polarizing game, with some players calling it the last good entry in the series and others seeing it as the beginning of the end of Call of Duty's ""golden age."" Regardless of your opinion of the game, it is undeniable that Ghosts had some peculiar weapon and map balancing. One only needs to look as far as weapons like the Vepr compared to weapons like the Ameli, and maps such as Warhawk compared to maps such as Stonehaven to see what I mean. However, I argue that these design choices were wholly intentional on the behalf of Infinity Ward in an attempt to provide commentary on American military dominance in the world. In this essay, I will explore how Call of Duty: Ghosts was less of a rushed entry with a far-fetched storyline and more of a viral protest of the disparity between the United States and its continued wars against contemporary enemies such as Iraq, Afghanistan, and most recently Iran.

We begin with some background for those who don't quite remember the arguably lackluster plot of Ghosts. The story begins around 2015 (IIRC, I'm not gonna actually research this lmao) with the outbreak of the Tel Aviv War which cripples the oil supply of the First World when all of the oil producing countries of the middle east are destroyed in the conflict. This weakens the US to the point of them losing their superpower status while the nation of Venezuela rises to the world stage with its plentiful oil reserves. Using its newfound resources, Venezuela makes its move to unite the continent of South America under one banner; it's own, rising to superpower status. The newly formed Federation of the Americas turns it's sights northward to the seemingly dying dragon that is the United States of America. After gobbling up Mexico and Central America, the Federation deals a crippling blow to the USA by destroying just about every major area in the country with WMDs made with paradoxically conventional materials. The game begins here, with the US reduced to third world status quite literally overnight and put on the defensive for once as the Federation closes in.

While certainly far-fetched, the story of Ghosts is, I believe, actually veiled commentary on the state of global affairs in regards to military might disparity. Infinity Ward knew exactly what they were doing when they wove a tale of the country's sudden fall from grace and the Federation's sudden rise to superpower status. The rise of the Federation holds parallels to the rise of the USA as a superpower in our own timeline. For instance, both saw their sudden upturn arise during a great conflict that destroyed much of the world. Both countries showed a great deal of patriotism during a conflict with a power on equal footing with their own, as seen in the campaign mission ""Federation Day,"" which takes place during a celebration of the unification of South America under the Federation's banner. Furthermore, the sudden fall from grace of America in the game is reminiscent to the seemingly sudden collapse of the USSR in our timeline. Both nations were extremely powerful, and both collapsed quickly and suddenly. The writers of Ghosts intended to create a world in which America was not the global hegemon it is today, and is instead on equal footing with a country just as strong, but nowhere near as developed. The writers envisioned a world of a Third World United States fighting against the most used example of what we today think of as Third World: the continent of South America. The writers intended to create this world as a protest of the power gap between the United States and her contemporary enemies, hoping to patriotic Americans a feeling of how quickly the world hierarchy can change.

This can be seen in the multiplayer balancing as well as singleplayer. The number of usable guns in the multiplayer of Ghosts is far outnumbered by the pile of worthless garbage. The map selection is equally as poor, with only a handful standing out from the rest. This was perhaps intentional from the designers, who wanted to emulate the disparity between the poverty of the Third World and the wealth of the First.

In conclusion, Call of Duty: Ghosts takes us away from World War Three, and brings us instead to a war in the Third World. The developers wanted a game where America wasn't guaranteed a victory, and would have to fight tooth and nail to return to her old way of life. At this, they certainly succeeded. At least, that's what I tell myself so I can sleep at night when I think about how awful this game was.",2020-01-08 21:00:08

CallOfDuty,2020,1,"Hey guys,

What multiplayer do you think had the best spawning system?

Personally for me it has to be World at War. You never really spawned too close to the action but also never too far away. I guess that made for lower kill counts as you'd spend more time running from spawn into action.

The new spawning system that has dramatically worsened since roughly BO3, is a nightmare.

I have never experienced awful spawning as bad as the new MW. Even in Ground War. No matter which spawn I picked there was always somebody who had me in their line of sight. 

I buy the new CoD every year and Advanced Warfare is the last game that I didnt sell (i rate AW quite high actually.) The following games I have sold before christmas. I lasted 3 weeks with MW before selling it. One noticable expectation for severely bad spawning is the map Piccadily.

I'm playing a lot of the iW4X ""mod"" recently. For those who dont know, it's a MW2 multiplayer client for PC. Hosted servers that incorporate map mods. Improved lighting, reduced fog plus additional maps from other CoDs. I've had more replay ability on this than any other CoD since AW.

What do you think had the worst and best  multiplayer spawning system?",2020-01-09 08:14:17

CallOfDuty,2020,1,"Let‚Äôs start with the obvious: Reznov. Somehow he looks older in WAW than BO despite WAW being roughly 20 years before BO. You‚Äôd figure he‚Äôd be in his 40s or 50s in WAW yet the wiki said when he died in BO, he was only 50. Wtf? 

Mason, Woods, Hudson, and Kravchenko return from BO1 in BO2. Hudson and Kravchenko actually do look and sound older. Mason and Woods don‚Äôt look or sound like they aged a day, when they were in the 1980s that is. What are the three of them even doing being on all these missions in their mid to late 50s? Shouldn‚Äôt they be long retired by then? Woods was nearly 60 in the Panama mission but you wouldn‚Äôt think that. 

David Mason looks and sounds like he‚Äôd be in his 30s or late 20s yet he‚Äôs actually in his mid 40s in 2025. Again, wouldn‚Äôt he be retired from combat at that point too? 2025 Woods talks far too good for someone in their 90s, let alone a crippled war veteran. Menendez is in his 60s in the 2020s yet he performs all these rather superhuman feats. 

To avoid some of this, I really think Alex Mason should have had a son during the 50s or 60s so that in the 80s missions in BO2, you‚Äôd play as his son. In the 2025 missions, you could play as Alex‚Äôs grandson. That would have made more sense imo.",2020-01-09 17:34:25

CallOfDuty,2020,1,"It‚Äôs 2020, how have the developers not capitalized on customizable characters yet?

Think about it, make your own character, fill in its own backstory, and then customized it with loot won in playing the game. 

Use the current challenge system to unlock gear, or pay to have the gear you want without earning it. Everybody wins! Nobody is gambling, and people keep playing because now they are invested in their character.

Bonus points if instead of different classes, we have different characters that we‚Äôve designed.

For example, my sniper might be dressed up in heavy camouflage, where as I‚Äôve designed another character to look like a 1940‚Äôs gangster with a sub machine gun, and another that looks like a Canadian woodsman hunter. 

If each of these characters had their own leveling system as well, it would keep the game fun as the characters you play more would be better kitted out than the classes you play less. 

I can‚Äôt help but to think players would be more heavily invested in all the decorative loot if each item was its own prize. Each hat, each pair of gloves, each tac vest, each accessory, and gun all part of leveling up your character.",2020-01-11 04:17:54

This led me to believe that zombies and the black ops campaign are intertwined. However, there‚Äôs no mention of actual zombies anywhere else in the campaign and furthermore, in black ops 2, it doesn‚Äôt look like the Earth was fractured after the events of moon from black ops 1. I‚Äôve done 4 black ops two so far and in 2025, there‚Äôs no zombies, no mention of zombies, anything like that.

The maps were colourful and fun, the exo movement is a blast and I love earning supply cases that had different appearance pieces in them.

I'd be keen if one COD every three years had exo movement, or was a sequel to Advanced Warfare. Two year breaks in between exo movement and futurism stuff would make people probably miss it, and two regular CODs in between is a nice break.",2020-01-13 05:43:05
CallOfDuty,2020,1,"(I‚Äôve lost all hope for infinity ward so this is mostly just a rant to activision and treyarch) I noticed that every call of duty that gets released never lives up to the greatness that was bo2. Why is it so hard to make a great multiplayer/campaign and zombies experience? Every year they (activision) release something different , some games are good somewhat but I remember being excited to come home from school in 2013 so I can hop online and play bo2 or gta with the boys and I wish I had the same excitement for the newer games but I don‚Äôt. Does anyone else feel the same? Bo3 was awesome too but i feel like it took a step down just a bit, (literally just a little bit because that game was lit af too) is it so hard to make good multiplayer or zombie maps, great scorestreaks, and an understandable storyline for zombies that won‚Äôt confuse people? Cod ww2 was a good game that restored my faith in activision (until bo4 violated that faith anally) because I actually looked forward to playing COD again (the excitement died down after a while) so I know they can make a good game but why is it so hard? Bo2 is turning 8 soon and it‚Äôs still a better experience then all the newer games (if you ignore all the hackers ;D) let‚Äôs hope that black ops 5 or black ops ‚Äúlet‚Äôs try this again‚Äù 1 is hype when it comes out ü§û(p.s. who else is gonna play it on ps5?)",2020-01-13 06:22:42

CallOfDuty,2020,1,"Hello, [r/CallofDuty](https://www.reddit.com/r/CallofDuty/).

This is my first time posting on this subreddit, but I have visited a few times before. Anyways, I have been playing a lot of Call of Duty: Black Ops. Specifically, Combat Training for general purpose and modded Nazi Zombies. I have also played through the campaign on the Xbox 360, and it was a really great campaign. The game brings me back 10 years ago when I was 10 years old. This game, alongside MW2 (on the CoD side of things,) are my childhood games. Anyways, I want to give my opinion on Call of Duty: Black Ops as a series.

I really loved Call of Duty: Black Ops, especially when it came out 10 years ago. I have many memories as a 10-year-old in 6th grade waking up on weekends or coming home after school to either play online with others or with bots. (While I was a squeaker, I never used my mic %80, but I just wanted to enjoy the game.) That game meant a lot to me (on the CoD side of things) and I have many great memories playing it. I loved the campaign; the plot was well set up, easy to follow, and was very fun and memorable to play. I loved the multiplayer; the wage matches were very fun, I loved setting up my classes, TDM was my favorite game mode. The contracts were a nice touch, and I loved that you could earn points instead of having to pay with your wallet. I loved the Nazi Zombies as well, but I love playing it with mods. I do play online, but only on the Xbox console. I just loved the game as a whole. It was not riddled with microtransactions or any modern-day annoyances or ""plagues."" The maps were quality, the DLC was actually good, the gameplay was solid and memorable.

Call of Duty: Black Ops II was also a great game. Personally, I thought the first game was better, but I loved the new customizations in the game. I loved how players could choose their weapons before the campaign, and I loved how overhauled the system was, even in multiplayer. The DLC was alright, the Peacemaker was fun to play around with, and I thought it was worth the money. As for the campaign, I really loved how the story continued with the Mason family. The story was a mix between the first and second game, which I thought was really cool. I really appreciated the fact that they involved aspects of the first Black Ops because it fits seamlessly and I thought it was a great addition to the story. The Nazi Zombies on this game, it was okay. I really liked that Tranzit map, but I would only play it online or on split-screen because I really never found much of a reason to play zombies. Much like the first game, the gameplay was consistent, but it was a lot more diverse than the first game.

I never have played Call of Duty: Black Ops III and IV (IIII.) The reason why was because both of those games looked so uninteresting. The gameplay completely changed from the first and second installments, obviously. The campaign in Black Ops III changed to where no members of the Mason Family were in it (which ticked me on personally because the series was always around the Masons.) The gameplay, I was not a big fan of the entire futuristic aspect. I did not like the fact that robots were taking a big part of the gameplay, and the entire style was not fitting. I felt like Black Ops III strayed way too far away from Black Ops (both the game and as a whole) and in my opinion, it really should not be a Black Ops game due to it having nothing to do with the Masons, the gameplay style, the built story from 1 and 2, and so on. I never played Black Ops IV because I did not like that there was no campaign. Rather, no campaign mode. The entire game is a battle royale game (from my impression) and I just thought that Black Ops IV still wasn't entirely worthy. I must give credit where credit is due; the Masons ""did"" come back with Alex's extended family and some form of a revival, as I read. At least there seems to be some kind of story, but the lack of a campaign still irks me.

In the grand scheme of things, I highly doubt that we will ever get a Call of Duty game like Call of Duty: Black Ops. At most, Black Ops II. The series has evolved way too much, and I would not want a remaster of Call of Duty: Black Ops because I am afraid that Treyarch or Activition will riddle it with MTX's, or it will be broken on day one (ref. CoD: MW:R) or worse, both. As much as I would love to see a Call of Duty: Black Ops V, I think that the series has gone far too downhill for Black Ops V to even be remotely good as it was the first or second game. I wish it would have ended at Black Ops II, or carefully and faithfully continued with the story and gameplay from the first two. Black Ops III, in my opinion, reminds me of Advanced Warfare, and Black Ops IV was (mostly) uncalled for. I'm sure the gameplay is great in Black Ops IV, but there is zero way we are getting an OG Call of Duty game like Black Ops (without there being some form of catch.)

I hope I did not go off too far from the topic, and I am sorry if I am ignorant about some things. I always had this opinion of the series but did some research just to verify or reinforce some aspects of this thread so it sounds at least presentable. If I am wrong on anything, please correct me. I would appreciate it.

What is your opinion of the Black Ops series?",2020-01-13 08:14:55

CallOfDuty,2020,1,"I feel like Call of Duty is becoming less like Call
of Duty every year. Even with the latest release.

I feel none of the studios want to actually innovate the Call of Duty concept and progress it to new levels, but rather follow trends and morph other games mechanics into the Call of Duty experience.

Just look at the jetpack games which feature advanced movement. They tried to capture and emulate why Titanfall was popular. Treyarch with their last two Black Ops games saw the success of class based hero shooters like Overwatch and tried fusing both games together. Infinity Ward saw how popular Rainbow 6 Siege and Battlefield was getting and decided to make a hybrid of the three.

What do I mean by actual innovation? Well a good example would be how MW2 advanced all the mechanics and ideas of the original MW. Or how Battlefield evolved the destruction mechanic to add Levolution which was the next level of destruction, allowing skyscrapers to be totally destroyed rather than just small buildings.

For me I would have thought we would have customisable Killstreaks by now. A more advanced and better balanced perk system potentially based on stats. Teamstreaks and extra layers to promote teamwork in a Call of Duty way. Plus more that I can‚Äôt think of that a team of developers would undoubtedly be able to think of.

I want Call of Duty to be a better Call of Duty. Not to follow other games.",2020-01-14 19:10:27

CallOfDuty,2020,1,"This has been debated time and time again, and we all know Activision isn't interested because COD still sells a zillion copies every year.

HOWEVER. 

IF COD were to ever go free to play, it would be great because the franchise has so many classic, nostalgic, great maps that are just gone forever. 

How I'd do it:

COD goes free to play with say COD 4 and MW2 being the core free experience. You get the guns and etc from those games and that's it. 

Maps for every other game are purchasable. So are the guns. BUT as skins. 

Gun stats would be normalized across the board. You could buy the skins of guns from every other COD, but their stats would all be normalized across the same pool of weaponry, because if you do it any other way, it becomes pointless with too many identical weapons..

Attachments are all unlockable through progressions. You buy a skin for a gun from some COD game, the skin just acts as that and a reason to grind camos and etc for it. Obviously the skins would have their original sounds and reload stuff intact. 

Perks are all normalized. Meaning they'd just pick ones that are the same for everything across the board. Killstreak rewards would be a selectable library based on the match or game you'd join.

Advanced warfare and Black Ops 3 exo movement would be their own playlists. Everything would be on filters. You'd customize your character and have it cued up for if an AW map or more came up in a map rotation or lobby

There'd be a battle pass system as well, with appearance customization being a thing across all maps, games and modes.

CallOfDuty,2020,1,"Hello, Call of Duty community!

I have been discussing with my close group of friends how we would rank our favorite Call of Duty titles. There are obviously different methods, based around personal opinion, as to how to determine ones favorite Call of Duty games (favorite setting, favorite play-style, favorite all around ‚Äúfeeling‚Äù towards the game, etc.) but my working theory is that most people determine their favorite titles simply by their personal playtime, or the titles that they first played when entering into the franchise. 

My question to all of you is two fold:

1. What are your top 5 favorite Call of Duty titles?

2. What is your rational when determine your favorite Call of Duty titles? What is the primary reasonings for you as to why this is your list?

My list is laughable for most of the Call of Duty community, but I believe it reinforces by beliefs as to why people choose their favorite games. My top 5 titles are Black Ops III, Infinite Warfare, Advanced Warfare, Ghosts, WWII. 

I was late to gaming (I got my first console junior year of high school) and my first Call of Duty to play upon release was Ghosts. My resulting ‚Äúhay day‚Äù of Call of Duty was the next 5 years encompassing the titles mentioned in my top 5 lists. I have certainly played all of the games, including all titles earlier than Ghosts, and have sunk countless hours into them. Just because I started late did not mean that I would not play MW2 to enjoy Commando Pro, Black Ops to experience the campaign, and CoD 4 to understand the origins of the multiplayer dynasty. I have clocked hundreds of hours in every single Call of Duty title, but my top 5 games I believe are simply reflective of when I was first introduced to the series and when I felt as though I was most a part of the community, experiencing the games live as they were updated and map packs were released. 

Further explanation for my list is that I enjoy the self-contained, one off stories and settings of the titles and their respective campaigns. I am also a huge fan of third game modes and the interesting and unique stories of Exo Zombies, Extinction, and IW Zombies makes the titles more enjoyable to me. 

Again, I understand the wildness of my top 5 titles and I don‚Äôt expect anyone else to agree with it, but I wanted to dive a bit more into what we believe the determining factors are for most people‚Äôs lists, and I think it has more to do than simply what ‚Äúthe best games in the series‚Äù are. 

What are your thoughts? Thank you for reading!",2020-01-17 22:09:23

CallOfDuty,2020,1,"I think that the next call of duty should just be all of the zombies maps put in one game so we can go thru and experience the zombies storyline and all the nostalgia associated with it. To go through the zombies story now I‚Äôd have to buy WaW, BO1, BO2,BO3, and BO4 plus countless dlc packs I think if they put all the maps in one game and has it just as zombies they could not only make a lot of money and make fans happy but also allow newer players to experience the challenge and fun of zombies",2020-01-19 00:48:21

CallOfDuty,2020,1,"I understand the first response is going to be ""UAVs were in COD since 2007.  You cannot change it because it's been a long-time feature"".  So lemme explain my idea:

So like in Black Ops 4, there was a ""healing"" mechanic that exclusively made use of the tactical equipment slot for the syringe.  In this idea, the same mechanic applies, only instead of healing your wounds, this system adds a **Battlefield- Esque tagging system**.  Here's how it works:

* When pressing LB (Xbox), you can tag enemies that are within your view.  You have to be looking at them while tapping LB to spot them.
* Spotting an enemy shows their position very briefly, but it only tags their last known location.
* Holding the spotting button on certain objectives will inform others of your intent.  If our team needs to capture B flag in Domination, I can look at the objective and mark it as a place I'll be going to.  This can change depending on the status of the objective.
   * Tagging a secured objective:  ""Defending here""
   * Tagging an enemy objective:  ""Attacking here""

The idea is to bring a more ""eyes on"" approach to discovering enemy personnel.  It's too often that people have to rely on UAVs to find people.  The streak is spammed to the point where everyone has to rely on Anti-UAV perks or are constantly required to bring a launcher to tediously shoot them down.  Now, am I saying UAVs are gone forever?  Probably not.  I would just have that kind of streak as a higher-tier requirement, but it works differently compared to a normal UAV.  Maybe an Oracle-like sweep from Ghosts?

CallOfDuty,2020,1,"**It was a single thought that turned into a couple of hours of thinking**

&amp;#x200B;

Basically Black Ops I &amp; II Combined, but remastered

Infinite Sprint

Dolphin Dive is back

    All The Maps from Black Ops I &amp; II :

(Array, Cracked, Crisis, Firing Range, Grid, Hanoi, Havana, Jungle, Launch, Nuketown, Radiation, Summit, Villa, and WMD.)\[BO1\](Aftermath, Cargo, Carrier, Drone, Express, Hijacked, Meltdown, Overflow,Plaza ,Raid, Slums, Standoff, Turbine, Yemen)\[BO2\].... and these aren't the DLC Maps

    All the Guns: 

(A FUCKING LOT) over 80 weapons... they kinda need to get reworked tho

The time to kill should walk the line between B04 and MW.

    Perks :

Pro Perks are back because what's a good game without a decent grind

Mainly all of the Perks from BO1 will be used ([http://www.cod7blackops.com/perks/](http://www.cod7blackops.com/perks/) )

There will need to be perk reworks such as Scout(aka this perk sucks until the second half) delete this perk and make the Perk Fast hands and Fast hands Pro gives Gungho as well.

Lightweight Pro gives dexerity the BO2 Dexerity Perk Minus aiming after running

Delete Marathon Replace with a Perk Called \[1st Base\] Replace diving with Sliding, Pro: Boosts Slide Manueverability an increase hipfire accuracy while sliding.

In Warlord Pro Delete extra tactical

    Class Setups: 

10-12 Class Slots, WildCards

Claymores are not level 1

Black Ops II leathals and tacticals... yes shock charge and sensor grenades buddy

    Weapon Skin system: 

Old school skin grind not MW

There should be weapon variants in the game even if you have to link BO3 and 4 weapons as a variant BUT you can't use the variant until the weapon is Gold. (VARIANTS SHOULD CHANGE STATS OF THE GUNS NOT JUST LOOKS)

The skins should be like BO4 reactive and after kill streaks ESPECIALLY DARKMATTER... but there should be 3 layers of Dark Matter such as Different for zombies ,and whatever 3rd mode there is.

If there are Loot boxes they need to be purely cosmetic NO MORE GUNS IN BOXES...

As for character customization gimme the Ghillie suit back lol... they should just have Stock characters with customizable skins.

    Prestige System:

80 Levels and 10 Prestiges with a level 1000 Prestige Master

Every Prestige Level should have a Custom Weapon and Character Skins that go with the Prestige Emblem

Weapon Prestiges have 5 levels: Clan Tag, Emblem, Customizable Kill Counter, Kill animations,and TWO FREE WEAPON ATTACHMENTS

CallOfDuty,2021,1,"Just won my first match of COD: Mobile, of both the new year and just time in general. 

The best approach is an AR, and a Sniper, keep only the ammo you need and always finish your kills. Use the ninja kit and if you are with a teammate try to get them to use medic. 

The ninja helps you escape/zone better and faster, while the medic will heal after damage taken. Sound will distract you, so turn the sound off and use the top compass and the map to guide you. When sound is non existent your eyes work better and are more awake, and are less prone to miss enemies and loot. 

Reflex sights on guns are just distracting, as you have to look at a red dot on a square, while with the iron sights you need to line it up, using more concentration. Avoid thermal scopes if you can, as that may highlight the target but yet again, it‚Äôs distracting and makes you more prone to losing sight of a target, due to the highlights and the zoom the target can slip through blind spots. 

Hope this helps, and happy new year",2021-01-01 01:42:41

CallOfDuty,2021,1,"So there's this trophy for Call of Duty: Black Ops 1 (BO1) called ""Vehicular Slaughter"", where it describes itself as ""Destroy all enemies on vehicles during the prison break"". And it takes place on the 2nd mission entitled ""Vorkuta"".

Now I'm going through a Veteran playthrough of this game, and also keeping in mind the mission-specific trophies (and intel) at the same time, all in order to get the platinum.

So I've destroyed, at least what I believe to be, all the vehicles/people on vehicles throughout the mission, but I'm not getting the trophy. I've looked up guides only to find it was a hotly contested debate back in 2010 about where the trophy actually begins, whether it be from when you start off on foot, or when you start on the motorcycle, or finally some saying it starts when you get on the back of the truck.

But either way, like I said, all of the guides and whatnot are from over a decade ago, and can't find anything from today, or recent. So my request here is, if someone could please test out if they can get the ""Vehicular Slaughter"" trophy (obviously on a new account, or at least one that doesn't already have it), and if you are successful in achieving it, please tell me how you got it, and where the trophy actually begins.

CallOfDuty,2021,1,"mine are: (not included cod 1, 2, or 3) 


COD4: The G36C


buttery smooth and amazing with a suppressor, some of the best sights in the game


WAW: The Gewehr 43


no recoil and always a 3 shot, 1250 rpm cap making the gun fire as fast as i click the mouse (or pull the trigger)


MW2: The M4A1


yet again, buttery smooth with no recoil, a fast fire rate, and just my overall favorite. it slightly beats the TAR-21 for me


BO1: The g11


essentially the cod4 m16 with a built in extended mag and godly hip fire performance


MW3: The CM901


One of the most fun to use guns, alot of people make it out to be this impossible to use gun but the recoil is really easy and the fire rate is generous for the guns 2 shot potential 


BO2: The AN-94


the sexiest reload in bo2 and is one of the most risky due to the slow fire rate but the hyperburst makes thus gun a monster 


Ghost: The FAD


idk why i love this gun so much, one of my fav in all of cod. fast fire rate with a generous capacity and some sexy as fucc sights 


advanced warfare: The HBRA3


basically the same story as the an94. mediocre reload hut hot damn is this thing fun to use and powerful.


BO3: The KN-44


the most under appreciated gun in this game.  basically everything you'd want in an AR, the recoil isn't too hard either even with rapid fire which is aa must have 


IW: Type 2


3 words: Akimbo Submachine guns
otherwise the gun is pretty good, but the split pistols make this thing godly 


WW2: M1 Garand


not much to say, low recoil, decent fire rate, and always a 2 shot kill.


BO4: The Swordfish


i know its a tactical rifle but ill put it on here because i don't really like the bo4 ar's. 4 round burst monster with one of the best sites in the series.


MW2019: Ram-7


Fast TTK, easy recoil, and good sights, whats not to love? the movement is also pretty good 


bocw: The AK47


low recoil and high damage. whats not to love?


whats your guys list?",2021-01-01 23:52:53

Hopefully someone out there can help me. This Christmas a family member picked me up a Cosair VOID RGB ELITE Wireless headset which works perfectly with my PC. I have Cold War on PS4 and am running into an issue with the headset only in Cold War. The ps4 recognizes my headset. It's set as default for audio input/output. Works perfectly when I test it through the ps4 settings. In game, I can hear in-game sounds and others chatting. I can't for the life of me get my mic to work so I can talk to party members. When I use the test mic option in settings, the bar moves as if it's hearing my voice but I hear nothing and once I exit settings, if I try to talk to a party member, absolutely nothing, they can't hear me. I've updated the firmware on the headset, tried clearing the cache on the ps4, charged the headset fully, turned the sensitivity setting for my mic all the way up, and still nothing.... Am I missing something? Any help is appreciated. Thanks.",2021-01-02 02:10:35

I have the game on steam

CallOfDuty,2021,1,"Hey everyone. I was talking to a friend today, and we were talking about the funniest quotes in Zombies. I remembered that on BO1 Der Riese, maybe twice, i have gotten a quote from Tank where he says something like ""Hey Richtofen, this one's at the perfect height!"" when near both Richtofen and a crawler. And the odd part is, it doesn't sound like Steve's voice, but rather someone attempting to impersonate him. Does anyone else remember this quote or know if there is a story behind it? I think maybe a Dev snuck it in under the radar. Its super rare, ive maybe heard it 2-3 times. Just curious!",2021-01-02 07:53:30

Because let's be honest...the maps as a late especially new ones are not really that good... I mean just look at Piccadilly from Modern Warfare 2019..

They should have given the community a map editor so we can start creating our own maps and share it with the community 

I mean Fortnite has one don't you think the Call of duty Games should have one as well?

This should be for all platforms

CallOfDuty,2021,1,"Not really used to posting on reddit, hopefully this is the right sub for stuff like this.  


Just recently i picked up BO2 after not playing its multiplayer for a while and decided to try the campaign mode again.  
I start from the very beginning and put it on ""Hardened"", Pyrrhic Victory and Celerium ran fine but in Old Wounds i encountered a bug that did not let me progress forward.  


The start of the mission runs fine, everything works up until the russians attack and you have to leave the city with a horse.  
Voicelines  took extremely long to load after that and sometimes loaded in all at the same time or didnt even load at all, music sometimes just stopped and didnt play again, i could feel my ps3 overheating or having trouble and if i quit out of the game it would stay in a black screen until i forcibly removed the disk from my PS3 Superslim.  


The worst part about this though is that even if i ignore the voicelines and the overheating, after taking down and defending some weapon cache and going back to the city, my game fades to black and the same distant explosion sound loops on seemingly forever (Altough one time i managed to get to a cutscene and then to some part where i destroy a tank, after that the distant explosion fade to black happened again)

I have already switched accounts and cleaned my disk, nothing helps. Other COD games seem to work fine and other games not related to COD work perfectly as well, i suspect this has something to do with the disc itself but i cant find anything relating to this online. If it helps, the disc is not scratched in any way, i dont even play the game that often so i dont really know what is wrong.",2021-01-04 01:57:48

The past for 4 CODs I have had a 3 K/D, with Cold War, and MW the community has been wanting SBMM to be removed. I just don't think it's as bad as it seems, the game has more issues than just SBMM, weapon balancing, poor map design, inconsistent spawns, poor visibility, scorestreaks. With all those negatives the game is fun though. I still hop on, and pub stomp, but when I do get matched against good players it reminds me of when I was playing BO4 league play at master division. idk SBMM isn't an issue for me, and I also don't like how everyone compares how they have one good game then they're playing against pros, most of you probably have no idea what it is like to play against a pro, for example the other day I was playing against Dashy (he is a pro player) he was using a 50 cal, and rpg dropped a 60 kills.

CallOfDuty,2021,1,"It seems with Tom Henderson's announcement now that there is rumors of multiple Call of Duty titles coming out and I think it's going to change quite a bit, but in terms of how they release them is another thing. 

From what they've been saying is that the next COD is COD 2021... so we've skipped over MW2020 now. 

2020 was the release of Cold War. 

2021 might be the release of Advanced Warfare

2021 might also release Modern Warfare 2 Remastered Multiplayer

2021 Warzone will still be relevant due to Cold War / Rebirth Island

But now that WW3 is rumored to be somewhere announced, then does this put Infinity Ward's next Modern Warfare, named Modern Warfare II -- in 2021 or 2022? 

I do think that there will be a different version of Call of Duty released for ""variety"" purposes, but Cold War still has a year left in it, and the Modern Warfare crowd will get the MW2 Remastered Multiplayer at some point. 

I find it a bit ironic that when people asked about the MW2 Remastered Multiplayer they said that it would ""split the player base"" -- but announcing multiple titles like this seems tricky, if not confusing. If Activision is all about making money from Warzone, then announcing new titles to tie into Warzone in some form should be a no brainer, no?",2021-01-05 02:03:48

CallOfDuty,2021,1,"It blows my mind when I think about how OP and broken MW2 was, but that's what made it fun. Remember abusing the hell of the One Man Army pro with the noob tube? EASY kill streaks, and speaking of kill streaks the spawn trapping with the chopper gunner on Afghanistan was rage inducing, but a blast. 

That game was the epitome of unfair, but that's why we all loved it.

Now with MW2019, all these crybabies wanting nerfs for certain weapons/guns because they copy a meta setup from a youtuber/streamer and don't know how to use it so they complain about it. I'm talking about things like the GRAU which was a GOAT gun and now the Juggernaut -- complainers have ruined current day Modern Warfare. 

At least the lobbies now are a good mix of multiple levels and SBMM has been toned down more, but man -- kind of hoping they don't release the MW2R Multiplayer, because people are gonna rage and be butthurt over broken mechanics. And maybe that's what happened, the developers looked at all the ""safe space"" bullshit and were like ""this isn't the game we know""",2021-01-05 18:31:16

CallOfDuty,2021,1,"Call of Duty gets a new game every year, but I think call of duty should follow down what COD Mobile did. Call of Duty should stop making yearly games and work on a single Free 2 Play game similar to COD Mobile.

**What would it have?**

This game would include

* Multiplayer
* Zombies
* Campaign
* Warzone

**Multiplayer**

Multiplayer would be similar to mobile, it will have a classic multiplayer gameplay (from BO2 and under) and feature new and old maps fully remastered/remade for the game. The game will feature classic weapons from all of the games (WaW - BOCW). (AND HOPEFULLY BRING BACK DOLPHIN DIVING)

**Zombies**

Zombies would feature a classic experience with entirely remastered zombies maps from previous cods and new maps as well. Every remastered/remade zombies map would include reworked Easter Eggs to fit the games Easter Egg system. (also the wonder weapons from each game/map)

**Campaign**

Campaign is the interesting part of this. The companies that work on the games (Treyarch, Sledgehammer, and Infinity Ward) can focus on working on campaign's for the game. They could also work on remastering past COD campaigns for it as well.

**Warzone**

warzone would become apart of the games system that will include a battle pass for the game with new content to add on, It would add the MW warzone map, Blackout, and Alcatraz as playable maps, all weapons  from current and past games will be useable.

**How would activision get money?**

Activision would be able to get money by making new multiplayer maps, zombie maps, and new campaign stories as expansions to the ever changing game. The Battle Pass will continue having its purchase system and the COD Store in MW and BOCW. and as much as i dont wanna say it...but probably loot crates (its a free 2 play game expect them).

**Why activision should consider this.**

Every year call of duty games get worse, BOCW had a extremely rough start and is still trying to catch up, Its time to focus one trying to have one singular project instead of multiple.

**Why it should be Free 2 Play.**

Call of Duty Mobile had over 100M downloads after its initial release and still continues to grow. It's been the most popular COD we've had for a long time. Another reason why it should be F2P is because think about games that's done it. Destiny 2 went from being a paid game to a F2P game and they are still going strong with a growing community.

CallOfDuty,2021,1,"TL/DR: Items purchased in game should be recorded on a [blockchain](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/blockchain.asp) and be able to be traded, sold, and permanently owned/collected on an immutable ledger.

With the merger of the 3 current games (Modern Warfare, Warzone, Black Ops), and the further integration between all platforms (PC, Xb, PS)...having a way to truly OWN skins, and hold on to them forever, while also exchanging with others....just makes sense. I'd be willing to spend $20 , $30, $100 on a skin....But, I want to be able to trade it when and where I want. Blockchain allows us to do that. And in turn, blockchain allows us to create a virtual economy based around Call of Duty in game items. Which benefits both the players and the developers, together!

**What are the benefits for players?:**

\- Permanent ownership of the items that are purchased / earned in game or in the marketplace - ownership would be permanently recorded on a blockchain ledger (i.e. - Blockchain)

\- Ability for players to trade / sell items that they no longer use - this would presumably need to take place on a marketplace (3rd party or one run by the developers)

\- Collecting - with a marketplace and the ability to trade ownership in place, it would open the possibility to truly COLLECT skins.

**What are the benefits for the Developers?**

\- Increased brand loyalty and commitment to the Call of Duty brand. It's proven that games that offer tradeable assets tend to retain players for a very long time. When a player invests in an item, they build more commitment to the game itself (call of duty)

\- Increased interest in the marketplace (most lucrative part of the game)

\- Opportunity to release TRULY limited 'merch'. It's no question that limited merch is THE name of the game. Everyone wants a limited collaboration between their favorite artists. I can already picture an Android Jones themed gun skin, or a Supreme branded sweater, that is up for sale for a limited time....(okay, maybe not your style. But, you can understand my point)

\- Brand loyalty that spans across multiple platforms and game titles.",2021-01-06 14:18:28

1. Are the advanced warfare games, and black ops games set in the same timeline/storyline, or are they independent of each other?
2. What is the order of the modern warfare games? I just completed COD MW 1 Remastered, (it was my first COD game), was I supposed to play the first 3 games to get extra lore?
3. where do the new games such as infinite warfare (2016)/ advanced warfare (2014)/ modern warfare (2019) come in this timeline?
4. what is the order of the black ops games?

CallOfDuty,2021,1,"I think that it wouldn't be too futuristic, this is just Speculation, but I think that Sledgehammer's game should take place in the 2040s rather than the 2050s, 2060s or further. So there are rumours, keep in mind ""Rumours"", that Sledgehammer will develop this year's Call Of Duty. It's not going to be WW3, that rumour was already debunked and is fake, also there is already a game by another developer called World War 3 that isn't a COD Game. 

So the reason why I think it should be set in the 2040s is because that is when Black Ops 4 was set, and it managed to pull off a Futuristic Feel without using Jetpacks, and BO2 managed to pull off a Futuristic Feel despite the setting only being 4 years off from now.

It could be an AW Sequel for all I know though, as we know, Kevin Spacey got into lots of trouble for reasons, so if it is an AW Sequel, he will not be making an appearance(Also his character's dead).

Another thing I think is that it will be an Advanced Warfare Reboot, I know that calling it ""Advanced Warfare"" would make it hard to distinguish, so maybe add a subtitle similar to Cold War. As I think unlike Modern Warfare Advanced Warfare is a bit too new to reboot as it was released in 2014.

If it isn't futuristic though, I think it would be WWII:Pacific. I don't think they'd go to Vietnam because we saw that in Cold War and also it is probably too controversial a conflict to cover fully.

CallOfDuty,2021,1,"I'm a fan of the franchise, always have been, and in lockdown, I've recently started playing Black Ops III for the first time, and after deciding I was back into CoD, got Cold War (I've just played the multiplayer so far, nothing else yet).

I would personally categorize Call of Duty titles into four main phases - The Classic era (CoD 1-3), the Golden era (MW - BO2), the experimentation era (Ghosts - Black Ops IIII), and now we're in the modern era (Modern Warfare - now). I started with CoD 4 and mostly fell off the wagon with CoD Ghosts. Now that the franchise seems to have found its feet again (I've come to peace with loot boxes and microtransactions, though they do piss me off) I'm interested in where they take things next, and what eras they cover.

\- Experimentation

&gt;I'm a big fan of when they try lots of things, the franchise is too long and old to give people the same stuff. If I didn't like a direction they were going in, I'd just play an old CoD (I've been playing CoD 4 casually on-and-off for years, the game never ages in my mind) and now that all of them have a host of DLC and microtransactions, they can still make a profit on old games, and therefore take bigger risks on games, because if people don't like the current CoD, there's still a host of other games to play and spend money on. For example, I didn't know until today that there was a Black Ops IIII, and that's okay - I'm sure it made loads of money, and if people didn't like it, it really doesn't matter since there are always more games coming, and the previous games are still turning a profit.

\- Build out, not up

&gt;carrying on from that point, if they take more risks and go outwards more they can attract new fans, keep old ones on their toes and keep the franchise moving in new directions. For example, Adveanced Warfare was hyped upon release, and while not universally loved, it was instantly recognisable, and IMO has had it's reputation drop because of the jump pack system, which only began to be hated as it became a common feature. Had the other games not carried that system forward and instead built their own new systems, it would keep each game unique and easily recognisable. Just because one system works for one game, does not mean it should stay and become integral.

\- Taking more time

&gt;It's crazy they still release yearly, I was very surprised to learn that even during the pandemic they agreed to a game a year. I would add a year after the Tyreyarch &gt; IW &gt; Sledgehammer cycle loops around, so every four years there's one year off. Honestly, another year on the production of each game would probably help the standard keep going up, and I think as long as the one before the year break has a bit more DLC than usual to carry people over into the new year, then the gap would be worth it. I don't think they should ever add a 4th major studio, because if they want to do sequels it will be a half-decade before the next installment comes out.

# The Fure of CoD

\- Some ideas for new themes

&gt;With all that I've already said, I think that they should push their themes further. There are not too many more real-world wars they can cover, everything else is either before WWII and doesn't match the playstyle, is far too political, controversial or boring (I know wars should not be described as boring, I mean from a gameplay sense) or is set to recently to be considered anything other than a Modern Warfare game.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Vietnam**: The one they've never made a full game out of is Vietnam, but that is covered in a few Black Ops games, and I wonder if the nature of the conflict, especially for the US, makes it a touchy subject for being turned into a game, alongside the limitations of every multiplayer map being featured in one country maybe is a bit limiting. Still, I could see it translating into a game quite easily, especially if they took inspiration less from the actual war, and more so from movies like Apocalypse now, which I think has a really cool colour palette and aesthetic that could make for a great, unique game. I know Sledgehammer was potentially making a Vietnam set game, but I'm not sure if I'm remembering wrong.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Crime / Drug Wars:** Avoiding actual wars, the other major world conflicts the game could take inspiration from is Drug Cartels and the the wars revolving around crime and drugs. While I think the current political climate probably doesn't make a police-based game likely (at least in the US), a south american, cartel vs government theme could work nicely and have a fun variety of maps across South and Central America. It could explore gurrila warfare, morally grey characters on both sides and have game modes focusing on drug busts.

\- some more out-there ideas

&gt;**Apocalypse**: I was always surprised by how Ghosts failed to go as apocalyptic as it could have done, and I think it makes perfect sense to feature a post-apocalyptic CoD game with an end of the world vibe, verging into Mad Max 'apunkalypse' territory. Not only would this be a fun new theme, but it's a great way to naturally shake up classic systems like create-a-class or scorestreaks, while also keeping close enough to the actual game, and giving the modeling team permission to go crazy with gear and camos and crazy apocalypse kit.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Zombies**: Building on from that idea, it's crazy that the ever-popular Zombies mode has not been turned into a full-on game. Perhaps the long-term zombies' storyline (if it's still going) would be too wacky, so a more standard walking dead scenario would be fun. This and the above idea could be rolled into one idea, where Multiplayer, Zombies, Campaign, and Warzone form a quarter of a larger post-apocalyptic narrative.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Alternate History**: The obvious being 'what if the Nazis won?', which is obviously similar to Wolfenstein, but given how CoD is also an FPS with many games playing against the Nazis, I'd say there's room for both, as long as CoD does not also take the steam/oil punk aesthetic. There's also plenty of other Alternate histories you could visit, from simple 'what if Russia won the cold war?' to more extreme 'what if the roman empire never fell?' - it's crazy to me to think that CoD's reliance on multiplayer means that maps are a center point of the game, but the worldbuilding for any of the fictional games is never really that out-there.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Civil War**: If they wanted to be bold and take a page out of Ubisoft's Far Cry book, they could use the current political climate to their own advantage and make a politically charged US civil-war type game, with the country split by beliefs and tearing itself apart. Could be a fun way to utilise some great American iconic landmarks for maps, and since the games have used China, Russia, Germany and the Middle East as villains, it would be fun to see the games make the USA the 'villains'.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Time-Travel**: While it might sound too out there for even CoD, I think this would be a great way to utilise two timelines, perhaps a early 20th centruy conflict, joint by future tech, characters and ideas. Merging the two could potentially roll into the alt history idea I talked about earlier, and the new techn gives them excuses to go further back to create a war that's both historical but also fictional.

Let me know what ideas you have! I'm not too sure on what the Dev cycle is now, and while Infinity Ward are likely to make an MW2 (again), that still leaves two spaces for new games in new eras. While the most safe bet would be to do Past &gt; Present &gt; Future in a cycle, I'd love to see the new era of the game shake things up a bit.",2021-01-09 11:52:02

In that regard, part of me is wishing that **Advanced Warfare** is the continuation of the best ending of **Black Ops 2** much like how **Black Ops 3** is the continuation of the worst ending of **Black Ops 2**.

CallOfDuty,2021,1,"So I just finished the campaign for COD Modern Warfare 2 Remastered (my first COD game) and I loved it but I was trying to find the order of the timeline to figure out which games I should play next and got confused. It says that COD: MW1 (2019) is a half reboot, half prequel to COD4: MW but at the same time a different timeline from the OG Modern Warfare series. Is COD: MW2 Remasted based on the COD: MW1 Remasted timeline or is it in the exact same timeline as the original games.

Plz help, I just don't understand the timeline of COD4: MW, COD: MW2, COD: MW3, COD: AW, COD: MW Remastered, COD: IW, COD: MW (2019), COD: MW2 Campaign Remastered. Is it all the same timeline or different &amp; what the order of it?",2021-01-10 07:38:59

So to help me please;
Where TF do I shop/get one? I've googled and googled and only found one website that had 1 for sale for $80, which is almost as much as I paid for the console and the game combined, I definitely can't afford that right now but also I just don't trust the website, anyone know a website or forum or anything?

I am pretty sure I am not the first to think about this but don't you think that new Call of Duty should develop alternative campaigns for their scenarios, like I would be interested in a Call of Duty or any FPS military shooter that has a Soviet soldier or operative as the main character  in the Cold War or Russian soldier in modern war or World War 3 setting. 

I am usually very tired of playing as US or Britain as the main military players since they seem generic or boring, beyond that there are many other interesting conflicts that Call of Duty could adapt:

Sino-Japanese War

Greek Civil War

Iran-Iraq Conflict( Controversial choice though)

Sino-Vietnamese War

* the matchmaking is strict so your going up against high ranking players all the time and its not fun

* Lobby's disband after every game 


* theres no option to search for Games based on your connection 



**HERE'S WHAT I WOULD CHANGE**

* just like in the old games is you choose to prestige you have to unlock everything just like in the original Game (except for weapon levels you keep all the attachments you've earned I have an idea for that)


* any future DLC weapons, perks, streaks, equipment are not be on the battle pass except it will be on a level in your prestige (so not only do you unlock everything again but you're always unlocking something new!)


* Have a Daily log in bonus 


* Have a friend referral system 


* Matchmaking would be incredible loose so you can play the game at your own pace 


* Have the option to either stay in the lobby or find a new lobby after a game 


* Weapons will have the ability to prestige and you reward for prestiging a weapon you can pick ANY camo or skin from previous games! 


* have the option to search for Games based on your connection quality (like the Search network preferences from Black ops 2)

CallOfDuty,2022,1,"My favorite Call Of Duty's pre-2013 are the original Modern Warfare, and MW2. For 3 specific reasons 

1. Memorable maps 

2. Pacing of TDM, and other multiplayer game modes 

3. Matches were actually memorable. I have distinct memories of SO many rounds of TDM. Either because I got a massive killstreak, there was an enemy I spent the whole round trying to kill, or because of team work with some random person on my team, etc 

And the reason why Cold War was so damn good to me, was because it ticks all three of those boxes. Something a Call Of Duty hasn't done for me since Black Ops 1. 

The pacing of TDM reminds me a lot of the old school Modern Warfare's, and I actually remember all of the maps even though I haven't played Cold War in 6+ months. 

Almost every other Call Of Duty released since 2013, I usually forget as soon as I move on to the next. I couldn't tell you the name of a single map. I probably only remember 1-2 maps per game, if that. And all rounds blend together, due to the fast pacing and lack of gameplay variety due to map design.

Lets talk about having a default gun in Modern Warfare, with no attachments, Its dog water. But then compared to black ops 2 use a default gun and wipe the floor with it no problem.

The default gun in modern warfare is slow, unnacurate, basically unusable, it requires attachments to be good, and then you have attachments that affect weird mechanics like movement speed, slide speed, Vertical recoil and horizontal recoil, and especially AIM DOWN SIGHT SPEED. They slowed down the aim down sight speed on default guns on purpose to make them bad, and then had other attachments that could speed up and slow down ads speed as well. Its just a complicated mess.

CallOfDuty,2022,1,[COD] this pistol is broke!! üòÇ,2022-01-04 08:32:34
CallOfDuty,2022,1,"Like many people I've grown up with CoD. Since I was at school with the release of OG games that put the series on the map (MW/MW2/BO/BO2/WaW) I've bought and played CoD. My whole school played these games, friends and family too. Lots of amazing memories around this game series. Lots of love. To some people, games are not ""just games"" they are vessels of entertainment and excitement that bring people enjoyment and memories together. I care deeply about Call of Duty.

But this franchise now imo is down in the dumps. Since Modern Warfare 2019 there's been a lot of things happen with this series that are negative. From games releasing with hundreds of bugs, some being game breaking, to games releasing with a lack of content, to games designed with a poor direction, to fan loved features being removed or butchered, poorly balanced games that primarily cause players frustration - just an overall lack of attention and lack of care. Completely ignoring customer feedback and fans as a whole.

After Advanced Warfare I gave the series a break as I gave gaming a break as a whole for a few years. I did eventually play some of the PS4 CoD games such as BO3 and BO4 once I got back into gaming, but the primary CoD game that got me back into CoD again like I was as a kid was Modern Warfare 2019. Considering this game is the best selling CoD game of all time, I'm sure this story is similar for a lot of CoD fans. The Modern Warfare name alone was a beacon to old time fans, signalling that the series was back but in full force ready to be THE shooter game to play again! But for me, my friends and many others, that's all it was - just a name.

Me and my friends came back to CoD with Modern Warfare 2019. We thought the revival would mean a reboot to modern day standards but with a similar gameplay direction. But what we found was a game that played nothing like the greats. Lobbies disbanding, no map votes, traditional Prestige system gone, frustrating camo grind, poor map design, gameplay ripped off from R6 Siege, poor visibility, a tonne of bugs, plus more.

Don't get me wrong, Modern Warfare 2019 brought a lot of good to the series and it's clear a lot of love was put into it, especially the art such as the animations and graphics - but it had a lot of issues. The pile of issues with this game caused me and most of my friends to hate it. They all stopped playing and thought they had been conned by the name, that it wasn't CoD anymore. I still kept playing as the only consistent pleasure I personally derived from playing Modern Warfare was grinding my aim/movement skills playing Shoot House and 3v3 Face Off daily. I felt the pace was fast and fun. I used these playlists to improve my overall CoD and FPS skills.

As a casual player it wasn't the most positive experience. For all the talk that goes on about casual players, at the time as a casual CoD player it certainly wasn't designed to make me keep playing. Casually trying to play the game like it was CoD4 was not a fun experience at all. Everyone had to switch up their playstyles to be much slower on most maps. The adrenaline pumping pace of CoD felt stripped away unless you were an extremely good player or the map was small.

Then we come to Black Ops Cold War. This again brought me and my friends in to play as it's a Black Ops game. We absolutely loved BO2 back on the PS3. We thought this would be equally and great if not better. But instead it launched with: even more bugs than Modern Warfare 2019, with very little content, an inconsistent and overall unfinished feeling gameplay direction, delay on League Play which in the end launched poorly, my CoD Points that I earned randomly disappearing and never coming back, had a lot of the same issues Modern Warfare 2019 had like disbanding lobbies, etc. Though the Zombies for me and my friends saved it. Having always loved Zombies in CoD, especially BO3 Zombie Chronicles DLC - it kept bringing me back.

Now comes to Vanguard. Only half my friends bought this game, the others gave up with CoD after Modern Warfare 2019 and Cold War - they felt CoD wasn't what it used to be. I did buy it as I'm still hooked. It's very clear to all now that the developers of CoD games have poor working conditions. These developers are overworked and have little time or even freedom to make a quality experience anymore. Activision are persistent at forcing these people to churn out a new CoD every year. To follow their 3 year development cycle to a T and shit out the game whether it's ready or not. Vanguard is easily the buggiest CoD game we've ever had. Many thought Cold War was unfinished, but boy does Vanguard take the cake! I've never played a CoD game this badly tested for bugs and glitches before! Not only that but all of the CoD games over the last few years (Modern Warfare, Cold War and Warzone) became broken after the Vanguard Season 1 update - Modern Warfare for a lot of people in UNPLAYABLE! Clearly there needs to be a change somewhere. This is unacceptable!

Excluding the bugs and glitches, Vanguard again is full of frustration. As much as I loved the feel and movement of Modern Warfare, outside of slide cancels being better balanced there's been no innovation from Modern Warfare. The destruction is lacklustre and buggy, mainly a distraction that gets in the way of core gameplay. The camo grind or grinding weapons in general is the worst it's ever been. Absolutely terrible balance. Not in the MW2 sense where 80% of stuff is overpowered therefore the overall balance isn't that bad, nah, in Vanguard about 40% of stuff is overpowered or broken, making the gameplay experience feel inconsistent and unrewarding. Outdated Killstreak system. The Zombies mode is the worst we've ever had in a CoD game, I have 0% interest in playing it until it's gotten the love it deserves with gameplay direction and content. Community feedback not being listened to as promised as per usual. No League Play at launch....

Speaking of League Play! Since Modern Warfare 2019 and trying to improve at CoD, I've gotten into CoD Comp. What seemed like a foreign and strange scene (largely because Activision puts zero effort incorporating Comp or making it appealing) is now my favourite part of CoD. But Activision spend no effort trying to grow the scene.

Everyone has to be listened to! Every community, that includes Comp. We can't kick Competitive lovers out on the curb. There was a lot of things that kicked off CoD's appeal back in the day and a big slice of that was the entertainment and competitive scene: from everyday players having the opportunity to grind their skill in tournaments to try and become a Pro to Pro players such as Scump giving CoD viewership through his videos and streams.

Now what do we have? There's no effort or incentives to help casuals get into Comp. There lacks proper structure for amateurs to clearly have a path towards becoming a Pro. There's no day 1 League Play to hook people into Comp from day 1, releasing it halfway through the life cycle is ridiculous. The League Play we do end up getting a la Cold War League Play was only loosely based on skill, the system itself was poor and didn't incentivise improving all that much because of no ELO. The CDL franchises have spent so much money yet neither Activision nor the developers have spent much effort at all trying to grow the scene at all. Games such as Apex, Rocket League, CS:GO, League of Legends, etc - all these games wouldn't be where they were without a rich competitive scene.

Activision and the developers themselves need to break out of this mental stigma they have that not focusing on eSports will make more money as casuals don't watch eSports. For all intents and purposes a huge catalogue of games on the market show this to be untrue. A good competitive scene competently structured to allow for growth will increase revenue massively. Right now, none of Activision are doing even 10% of what they could to both grow CoD Comp and therefore the CoD brand. They're simply content with relying on Warzone, being fully complacent with relying on a trending genre to keep the series afloat that may or may not be popular in the future.

Sorry for the large part about Comp if you're not into it, but this is a big part of what I love about this series and it's the same for other people too. This whole post is essentially my love letter to this series. I love it, just as I love GTA. It's brought me a lot of good memories and has a place in my gaming heart. But all good things must come to and end, that is if they're not maintained sufficiently. I now do not want to support this series anymore. Me and my friends have been burnt too much from the last 3 games to spend money and time on a game that primarily causes frustration and negative feelings.

I'm forcing myself to buy one last game to see if Activision and their developers change their ways. I'm putting all my trust and all my hope into Infinity Ward with Modern Warfare 2. If this game does not seek to fix the long-standing issues this series has and deliver a great CoD experience. If this game does not seek to launch in an acceptable, finished state. If this game does not treat the Comp scene with respect and try to grow it. If this game does not reignite love for this series anymore. Then I'm done. I can no longer buy the games anymore. I'm a very loyal gamer. If I love a game series, I will do everything I can to support it. I'm the type of person to have bought GTA V with every release (PS3, PS4 and PC) and soon to be PS5. It takes a lot for me to stop playing a game series, but if Modern Warfare 2 isn't the game it needs to be my loyalty is gone.

I sincerely hope Activision opens their eyes and makes change to restore this series to its former glory again. I really do hope Infinity Ward will knock it out of the park next year! Please, this is my last hope for this series!",2022-01-04 09:37:22

CallOfDuty,2022,1,"Call Of Duty 1, 2 and 3 are the best in my opinion.

So let's start with Call of Duty 1:

Campaign:

The campaign is pretty good, it has a good story, a lot of memorable moments and it isn't too unrealistic, so you can still take it seriously.

Multiplayer:

While the multiplayer is dead today, but Call of Duty 3 isn't that dead, if you're lucky you can find some lobbies, and if you're really lucky, a full lobby, but it's fun, it isn't unfair, and from my experience there are no cheaters, and maybe there were some back in the day, but it's really hard to find one today.

Also the multiplayer stayed about the same for the first 2 Call of Duties, so I'm gonna write multiplayer just for this one and 3, but it was pretty good.

Call of Duty 2:

Campaign:

Same feelings as Call of duty 1, but more memorable and fun,  I consider this the best Call of Duty Campaign.

Call of duty 3:

Campaign:

While not as memorable as the other 2 Call of Duties, still a good game, with better gameplay and a little longer missions.

Multiplayer:

As I said it's not that dead, but in my opinion Call of Duty 1 and 2 were better, even with a full lobby it's sometimes hard to find players to shoot at, and also it added the reason I don't like the battlefield games much, vehicles, if the other team has a good tank driver, then you're gonna get absolutely fucked by the other team.

Now let me tell you why I dislike every call of duty game since then.

As a WW2 games fan I wasn't too excited to try the campaign of Modern Warfare as most military shooters aren't too good, but I did, and while better than most other military games, I felt that it was too irrealistic for the more realistic approach they were going for also the multiplayer died for me in this game, you didn't have all weapons unlocked, the ones that you had weren't good, and you had to level up to unlock weapons, I would be ok with this if it was treated differently, because unless you were playing since day 1, you're not gonna get anywhere, I know it's supposed to be rewarding, but after spending hundreds of hours trying to get to level 20, it isn't so rewarding, then the perks, this is the most frustrating aspect of every game after this for me they give you too many benefits, there are also cheaters to this day, and at the end the combat encounters are decided by who has the best gun, not the best skill, also a problem for leveling up, but it still can be enjoyable at times.

Then Call of Duty World at War, better than Modern Warfare but not better than Call of Duty 2, campaign was good, not so good, the multiplayer was the same, and since then every campaign was ridiculous, and for me not enjoyable, and the multiplayer, even tough they've tried to change it, they just make it worse.

Also if you want better WW2 games, play the Medal of Honor games.",2022-01-05 14:57:23

CallOfDuty,2022,1,"I know this will get downvoted to oblivion but hear me out on this

As you may know mw2 is the most popular and best rated in the series but there is something I don‚Äôt like about it and that is the seriousness with it.

As many people will ask what does it do with the game is. And I will answer that cod has been and always been for the veteran who died in wars but I think mw2 changed that to endless shooting and bad Russians this is the thing that I don‚Äôt like I wanted it to be serious like the previous games for example compare cod4 trailer to mw2‚Äôs. cod4 trailer is serious and storytelling and mw2‚Äôs trailer is shooting and exploding and Eminem raping in the background this is number one the other is storytelling and timing what I mean is in cod4 you have missions that stops the shooting action a bit for example all ghillied up and the president view but in mw2 you got shooting bad Russians shooting bad Russians again with the world most accurate glock 17 that what I‚Äôm say and with the storytelling the same thing shooting Russian because they are bad. The third thing the different with a man in the army and one man army. Spoilers with this one but hear me out in cod4 at the end of the game when you takeout the main villain you don‚Äôt stand up and take him head on the friendly Russians made him and his men look the other way so you can get a clean shoot the thing is you won‚Äôt win without them if they were not there the villain would just kill you like gaz and the others. In the other hand mw2 made you kill Brazil bad guys by yourself this is what I. Mean I don‚Äôt hate it because cause it‚Äôs a sequel to a masterpiece this are just my opinion and it‚Äôs okay to disagree but I‚Äôd like to hear what opinion you have on mw2 instead of death threats.",2022-01-05 23:00:13

CallOfDuty,2022,1,"Wondering how playable every COD is as I‚Äôve a nostalgic itch to go back and play them. So I thought I‚Äôd see what people‚Äôs opinions are on the state of every COD game in 2022!

I‚Äôm specifically talking about a COD‚Äôs multiplayer and in regards to:

1. if it is easy to get into a game (for simplicities sake, just a game of team deathmatch)

2. if the game is playable (not the about mechanics of the game, you‚Äôre entitled to your own opinion about if a COD is good or not, I mean can you get into a game of multiplayer and will there be a game breaking BUG or a cheater)

3. on console (since there‚Äôs more of a chance of getting into a game, though if there‚Äôs an active PC community feel free to chime in!) 

So, whatever COD games you have played recently, mark how playable their MP is out of 10. 10 meaning works like a charm, 1 being legitimately unplayable

For example, MW19 is a 1 because I literally cannot load into MP. CW would be a 9/10 because it functions and has a good player base. Black Ops 2 would be a 4 because I can get into a game after a while but it‚Äôll most likely have a cheater. Warzone is probably at a 6/7 with the current bugs

Jot down what COD MPs and rank how playable they are! Interested to see what people have to say :)",2022-01-06 19:38:54

CallOfDuty,2022,1,"And why?    

[Tl;Dr at bottom]    

I've been wondering recently; I've heard mostly bad things about them but I'm obviously curious after playing 11 of them, since BO1 (ignoring CoD 4 original and minus MW2 multiplayer and MW3). I obviously bought Ghosts, AW, IW; despite hearing bad things about them as I'm in general a fan of the series.

I know there's been *a bit of a rough patch* for a while bit there's still hope in my heart there will be a good game (even with SBMM maybe?).

I enjoyed MW2019 a lot, especially at release but I noticed a deterioration in MP at release of Warzone and beyond. So I'm guessing the next two kinda pivot around this quality.

(Any questions, just reply)

Tl;Dr: Although I've heard bad things about the 2 games, I think they look good and want to keep up with the player-base.

Edit: I put both to see results as I forgot to put a 'Results' option.

CallOfDuty,2022,1,"I played COD 4 when I was a kid, and I'm as nostalgic for it as anyone here. But honestly, the Nostalgia is too much. I've gone back to COD MWR and played it off and on over the last year or two, to earn Exclusion Zone and complete my Mastery Camo collection, and man... COD 4 is a god awful shooter game. It has aged like Milk left out in the sun, and I honestly feel like it's the worst COD multiplayer of all time. 

The gunplay is abhorrently bad. Rampant inconsistency in TTK exists with Stopping Power/Jugg, and Martyrdom/Final Stand means that you can die completely at random for no reason other than somebody clicking on a perk. Hit registration is borderline non-functional, with ghost bullets being a frequent occurrence. The gun balance is nonexistent, and there are a grand total of *maybe* 2 guns that are viable, the M16 and *maybe* the M4 Carbine. Any other gun is *much* worse than those two, and you're actively hurting yourself by not using them. The TTKs of these weapons usually hover around *100ms.* Weapon flinch is so strong that you automatically lose any fight ever where you get shot once by anything that does more than 20 damage. 

Gunfights are horrendously inconsistent crapshoots where skill is a nonfactor in large portions of fights. 

Movement is horrible. You're obnoxiously slow, and it takes 6 hours to mantle over literally anything. I don't like overly fast movement, I prefer something like BO2, but Jesus Christ this is ridiculous. The map pool is mediocre, with a couple decent maps, but a ton of horrible maps that genuinely qualify as some of the worst in the history franchise. They nearly universally *strongly* incentivize camping, and make it so that somebody sitting in a corner with an M16 literally cannot be killed under any circumstances. This is the only game in the entire franchise where camping is not only viable, but better than actually moving around the map. 

The game is terrible, and I feel like people rating it highly are just blinded by nostalgia. Every single criticism you can make for ""Bad"" COD games - bad weapon balancing, bad maps, bad gunplay, etc. can be made against COD 4, but harder than any other COD. Advanced Warfare's bad weapon balance has nothing on COD 4. The atrociously bad maps of MW are about as bad as COD 4's. More than half of my games devolve into nobody moving, everyone sitting in corners with their sights trained on a hallway, and they cannot be removed unless they screw up badly. I'm not even mentioning grenades being outrageously broken, or that the Helicopter is ridiculously OP and ruins the game when it's called in, or that Claymores are incredibly annoying. 

The game is completely and utterly broken, but not in a fun way like MW2. It's just a boring, terrible shooter with nothing redeemable to it.",2022-01-07 20:50:59

CallOfDuty,2022,1,"[COD]2023 (Treyarch) Campaign, Multiplayer, and Zombies: Ideas and Discussion

This will be long so bare with me if you feel like reading..

Campaign:

Campaign should take place either before or after events of 2025. I don‚Äôt think it should take place in 2042 like BF unless it really hits home and feels BO2 themed. I think there should be a mix of characters from BO CW, BO2, and a new protagonist/antagonist but with the lore of BO2 still involved. It would be cool to see older versions of CW characters like Adler similar to what they did with Mason and Woods and also throwback characters too like Harper and Menedez; if it takes place before the events of BO2. If not that‚Äôs cool too. I think there should be drones and robots but not with a huge emphasis on them(at least on robots)either prototypes or a scarcity of them for good reasons.


Multiplayer:

Multiplayer should definitely takes note from Vanguard and not from all the bugs but the progression system, gameplay mechanics, and customization. Things like tactical sprint NEED to be in this game, going back to CW after playing Vanguard just makes the game feel so slow and the movement in Vanguard is much more fluid, (obviously when you‚Äôre having a good game and not stuttering). Destructive environments should only return if they are drastically improved. Progression system in Vanguard is solid. It doesn‚Äôt feel like a major grind like CW and i like that the pace at which you progress is exchanged for reaching higher weapons levels (CW Weapon level cap is 55, Vanguard is 70). Doors should definitely be in a Black Ops game for once as I believe it provides for more balanced gameplay as opposed to sweatfests and consistent respawns in CW because every player respawns, only to run out to the battlefield and respawn again 1 second later. Another thing is the hit box in CW, it‚Äôs trash. I actually like that MW2019 and Vanguard rely on independent bullets rather than a hit box. I think Doors just make the game more immersive and reduce consistent respawns.. we already respawn a lot in COD and button spamming can get super annoying.  I honestly don‚Äôt think they should bring back specialists; however, they should bring back some of the gadgets specialists use (some not all, I really hated the Ruin/Gravity Spikes) and definitely introduce some new ones. Operators in Vanguard are much better imo, and i really love that you‚Äôre able to customize your dialogue now which should be an incentive for Activision since they sell skins, weapons, tracers, etc. All the score streaks in Cold War must come back but with improvements and advancements (for example, strafe run should be cut down to 2-3 passes not 4) and of course the return of the real hellstorm missile would be an advancement/throwback. For the little details, I think the haptics on Vanguard are much better but CW is still very good, so hopefully they improve on that. I also love the sound of getting a kill much better in Vanguard and the SFX of hit markers, they‚Äôre super satisfying. Also, i would love if they gave us a menu similar to BO1 and BO2 where mason is sitting in a chair, it‚Äôs not a must but it would be a nice touch for nostalgia. Most importantly above all, is pacings. This was the major problem for me in CW. It‚Äôs like playing Blitz pacings 24/7. Vanguard gives players versatility and the option to choose how they want to play, I absolutely love that and I think they really need to implement this in COD2023 as well as abandoning SBMM. COD2023 will supposedly have the IW engine, which i think is the  best move ever especially for zombies. Laslty, Treyarch should let us customize our HUD this time around.

Zombies:

Now for zombies, which I believe should be the main focus of this game and needs to make a major comeback. First of all, they really need to improve the AI of zombies as I feel it is a little too easy. I would love if Treyarch gave us mutations back from BO4 and allowed us to use it online this time around or just gave us the option to change difficulties (casual, realism, hardcore, etc). They should also introduce HUD customization. BO4 had one of the worst HUDS ever and CW wasn‚Äôt as bad but i didn‚Äôt like that i couldn‚Äôt take off the zombie casualties indicator that says critical kill, etc. It is convenient at times however, BO3 was so much cleaner and you got the most real estate on screen. I think being able to customize the HUD should be the standard for every COD these days. As for zombies in Vanguard, Treyarch should also takes notes and stay away from what they have done so far. It‚Äôs not good, and honestly I think the Vanguard zombies system just belongs with Sledgehammer and maybe they will improve with what they have built upon sometime in the future. After reading about COD2023 leaks, I love the idea of factions, it sounds like a mashup of all the zombie lore with a great story in its grasp, and i‚Äôm all for it. However, if Treyarch does bring back characters I think we should have the ability to customize them (like choosing if we want to play as Richthofen from BO1, BO2, CW etc). I think combining characters with operators would be the best move as it gives players the ability to tune the characters to how they perceive them, to their own personality, and what resonates with how they remember those characters (nostalgia) which is where i think being able to customize dialogue and skins on each character comes into play; which should be an incentive for Activision, to bring this idea to fruition; since, it will most likely involve micro transactions (which i‚Äôm not a big fan of, but would be willing to pay for in zombies mode). Now for the zombies system, CW is perfect. It gives the game balance. It gives players a reason to play zombies, especially now that we‚Äôre able to exfil. I love the upgradability system, being able to purchase more than 4 perks, the addition of the W.A.N.D. and the absence of gobblegums. Personally, i loved the gobblegum system until they started making ridiculous gobblegums powers ups that pretty much defeated the purpose of playing the zombies game mode. I don‚Äôt like the gobblegum system anymore because it‚Äôs inevitable that it will ruin the game mode, and potentially just make it boring, same goes for Elixirs in BO4. Although CW can get boring too, and that‚Äôs why I think Treyarch should really focus on nailing the Atmosphere that BO3 has in Shadows of Evil and their DLCS. The maps in CW could‚Äôve been much better and i think that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs a great game mode, but just lacks something and i think that something is the zombies vibe/atmosphere. I think this can really be achieved for the most part by giving players Zombies Chronicles 2, because BO2 also had the zombies atmosphere. One idea I have is that ZC2 should be divided into four parts and released in 4 different seasons (assuming there will be six) with at least one brand new zombie map that we have never seen in each season in case players just aren‚Äôt feeling the old maps. For example, each season should consist of one brand new map and two remastered/reimagined maps, which in four seasons would result in twelve maps for zombies; which, would actually be one map less than than BO3 in case Treyarch needs to maintain quality control of their content and can‚Äôt give us as many maps as BO3. I really think ZC2 is a great opportunity to bring the zombies mode back to equilibrium. Speaking of ZC2, i think Tranzit should return and this time how it was originally intended to be when it first came out, which is very similar to Outbreak. If we cannot get map remasters after all I really think Treyarch should bring back Tranzit and make it the new Outbreak mode. It would even be cooler to have a mode that supports vehicles (Outbreak) and one that requires taking a bus (Tranzit). And that‚Äôs my TED talk, get it‚Ä¶TED. ;)

CallOfDuty,2022,1,"Hey all, Veteran [COD] player here, long time lover of multiplayer - after a 7 year hiatus I‚Äôve found myself with covid in iso, and thought what better way to distract myself and get through this than to play [COD]. So I got myself an Xbox one X (with some games including [bo4]). Was super pumped to play, but then was bummed to find out you can‚Äôt just stick a game in and play these days, so I spent over two days downloading the update for [bo4] and warzone. Frustratingly, can‚Äôt connect to warzone, some issue with Xbox live, and I couldn‚Äôt find any players online on [bo4].
I just wanna shoot - so what cod games these days are the best for multiplayer, that are alive and well with lots of players? I wanna know before I spend anymore more money, data and time. Itching to play. Cheers",2022-01-08 20:49:54

CallOfDuty,2022,1,"Apologies if this type of post doesn't belong in this subreddit, I don't know where else to post this.

As the title says. Someone was able to get into my Call of Duty and/or Activision account and change the associated email with the account. This happened about a year ago now, and I eventually gave up hope of contacting support about my issue. Every rabbit hole I went down in the support website always led to nowhere. I tried making a new burner account as the support website suggested and followed everything the website told me to do, but when I would attempt to actually go through the support process I would be met with dead ends. I've looked everywhere for an actual live chat function for support, but have found no luck. I was so desperate I even tried sending an email to the person who hacked me, which obviously led to nothing. It's been beyond frustrating trying to deal with Activision's support, and in my honest opinion it needs a total rework. It's impossible to navigate and the instructions are unclear and misleading. I apologize for the mini-rant, I just had to vent my frustrations somewhere.

My reason for posting is to ask for advice or reach out to anyone with a similar issue. Is there some other support option I've been missing this whole time? Have I been going about the support process incorrectly? Is there some simple fix I might be able to do?

 1. The awful bow thing!

Getting the lightning bow sucks in every way and I hate it. That one spot near spawn is damn near impossible to hit and ruins every play through. The garbage bow ammo doesn‚Äôt help. The only alternative for round 12 is some annoying trap in the middle of nowhere.

Need I say more? This guy blows. And sucks. Less so sucks more so pulls you in via grapple. Still.

3. Innovation?

You get uh

you get a zip line and a boss fight.

CallOfDuty,2022,1,"This is a hot take discussion, so try to keep it civil.

Throughout the years, Call of Duty is always had some form of ranked play.  We always see it as what the professionals play and a mode where the most serious sweaty players enter.  People also see it as the most strict when it comes to finding players of equal skill level. This is to ensure that the competition is extremely fierce no matter what kind of match you are playing.

On the other hand, there's also public matches.  These games have less restrictions and no ranking structure. People often perceive this mode as something to play when you need to relax.  Putting effort in pubs is essentially frowned upon because doing so impedes another's enjoyment of the game itself.  

In my opinion, the two modes are not separated based on difficulty. They only differ based on rule sets and a shiny rank next to your name.  The truth is that, when it comes to any amount of effort put into public matches, players have their right to put the maximum effort into each game they play.  I find it ridiculous that someone will try to play public matches with the least amount of effort for the sake of casual play, only to writhe in anger because somebody put more effort than they did.  That's like placing a stick in your front tire while riding your bicycle and complain when you fall over.

Ranked is essentially the same as public matches. The only major difference is that there are more restrictions based on your custom classes, map rotation, and more.  As mentioned before, there's also that shiny rank next to your name that makes you feel happy (or depressed depending on what rank you received).  Granted, people may feel more compelled to put more effort due to the professional aesthetic, but that's still a choice that is not forced upon you. The only time I will disagree is if you are actually competing for money during actual tournaments.

That is just my opinion. I know there will be people who will disagree and tell me that Call of Duty should be casual. Hell, I'll probably get people telling me that public matches are supposed to be called casual playlists.  Regardless, whatever your comments may be, please keep it clean.",2022-01-10 08:22:21

CallOfDuty,2022,1,"I've seen a lot of people trying to say that supply drops were a good thing back in AW through WW2 
and most of them are talking about the BO3 lootboxes

what these people seem to forget is that even if they never spent a dime and got everything through grinding for free lootboxes, the existence of an option to pay real money for lootboxes without any upward limit, then making it so lootboxes we're the only way to get new weapons that were added to the game was predatory micro transactions 101

these systems were made to target players with gambling problems by giving them that ""I'll get it this time"" attitude after failing to get what they were looking for after a single lootbox, this would start a cycle of them drying their wallets trying to get that item they wanted

this is a practice used by many games outside of COD and should never be welcomed back into COD.
those of you who somehow believe lootboxes are better than, unlocking new guns through challenges, getting cosmetics through a battle passes and a store front (which all show you exactly what you're getting for your money) clearly don't understand why supply drops were added in the first place",2022-01-11 07:03:25

CallOfDuty,2022,1,"Modern warfare 2(2022's cod) will have a new mode that is similar to Six Siege.

In this *Rainbow Six Siege*\-like game mode, dubbed Attackers v. Defenders, players will be placed into one of two teams, for a more tactical, round-based experience. The attacking team will have an objective to complete, while the defending team will be tasked with stopping the attacking team from completing their objective. This is a format that will be familiar to fans of *Rainbow Six Siege*.

Attackers v. Defenders will also feel familiar due to the defending team being given gadgets similar to those that can be found in [*Rainbow Six Siege‚Äôs* multiplayer](https://gamerant.com/rainbow-six-siege-playstation-tournaments-extraction-longevity/). Defenders will be allowed to use boobytraps, cameras, and weaponry to halt the attacking team‚Äôs progress, including by building fortifications around the objective, or by destroying the in-game environment. Like *Siege*, *Call of Duty* 2022‚Äôs Attackers v. Defenders will also have a form of operators, however, this is different from in *Siege*, as players will be voted into occupying these roles. All around, this mode seems much more tactical in nature to what is often offered in *Call of Duty* games, which could win over *Rainbow Six* fans looking for something different.

CallOfDuty,2022,1,"Activision's general philosophy the force on their developers is to make the games easier for bad/casual players. Many game design choices over the years have been implemented into CoD to make it easier for bad/casual players.

So why then, are the default Controller Settings so bad? Heck, why are the default Settings in general so bad?

The games have shipped with between a 10% to 13% Deadzone by default over the last few years. This is way too high to make precise movement needed to aim at your best. Yes a high Deadzone means players are unlikely to experience stick drift, but bad/casual players won't suddenly stop playing CoD because they have stick drift... they will buy a new controller. Which if they play other games will have discovered they have stick drift already and will likely Google how to reduce it and discover what a Deadzone is.

The default sens is 4-4 which is way to low. At least bump it up to 6-6 which is what CDL Pros play at. Not that fast compared to high sens players, but it's still a lot faster than 4-4 and retains good camera centring/tracking.

Motion Blur and Depth of Field - maybe keep it default for Campaign but if the player selects Multiplayer it should auto-default to off. Nobody, I mean nobody likes these settings for Multiplayer. The bad/casual player ain't playing on a monitor or PC. They need as much help as they can get to see shit. Adding blur to their image just makes it harder for them to see enemies on their TV (which mag already have an average/bad pixel response time).

Maybe the developers would need to create separate Settings Profiles for Campaign, Zombies and Multiplayer if they want to default certain Settings for the Campaign (like Motion Blur and Depth of Field). But I just don't see how if they really want bad/casual players to have a good time, why they would set the default Settings up so badly.",2022-01-12 09:12:15

Basically, I've had the S1X modding client for awhile now, and I've actually been able to play it a few times, however I don't know if it's AW or the Client, but I seem to have CPU issues when the game is running.

Basically when I die while playing MP, my game freezes, then crashes. I also get a window that pops up, saying to update my GPU drivers, which is weird, since my drivers are fully up-to-date, and I have a GPU that is well over what's recommended. I also sometimes get windows that pop up before the game starts saying that my CPU doesn't meet the requirements, and I have an I7 8700K...

Has this happened to anyone else with AW on PC? It's really weird, as sometimes I'm actually able to play, but other times u get these issues, and my game runs poorly...",2022-01-12 17:37:40

Perhaps COD did some kind of campaign similar to the movie 1917 (great film if you haven‚Äôt seen it) it could end up being extremely unique and could make up for the lack of weapon variety and detail compared to modern weapons and gunplay.

CallOfDuty,2022,1,"I know this probably won't be a thing but I was wondering is anyone else ever felt that the yearly release of cod games should be change?

I feel that with extra time even with a cod releasing every 2 years would make a huge difference in the quality of the games released. 

I don't think that would be an issue that would impact negatively on the game. 

I know some may not want to play the same game for 2 years straight and I feel that extra year could make a more worthwhile experience.

With more development times also comes more worthwhile features more seasonal content and more content overall.

For example more zombies content like maps spanning over the 2 years. Possibly more story content. And of course more weapons and cosmetics to those who like that type of content.

Then there's warzone that could be expanded upon as well with events and gamemodes.

Cut content could get added like the emblem maker and a better fully functional theater mode. 

Custom game lobbies could be an addition not just for the multi-player mode but for zombies and warzone as well and this would be a stretch but a custom lobbies browser where you could join others created lobbies 

Also unpopular opinion extinction would male for a nice return possibly 

Not all of these ideas are for one title but with more time to polish up these games a lot of these things could be possible additions to consider 

But as I said I know this is farfetched and likely will never happen. I just feel that Activision should give cod titles more development time for an overall better play experience.",2022-01-13 12:32:14

CallOfDuty,2022,1,"Me and a group of friends want to play CoD 2 again on a private lobby like in the good old times.

When we were kids we used the cracked version with Evolve or Tunngle to play LAN but those dont exist anymore and now we can actually buy it.  
Now idk if its a possible thing because from what i remember (and i dont remember well since this was years and years ago) creating a private lobby online was a hassle in MW, MW2, BO....

So im asking if its possible because we dont wanna play on public servers?

And if its possible how did you do it?

I know this might be a stupid question but i just want to make sure before we all spend money on it.",2022-01-14 18:44:08
CallOfDuty,2022,1,"So its been about 2 years since the remastered MW2 campaign came out, and roughly 13 since MW2 initially launched. A lot of people have fond memories of this game, which is entirely fair. This is arguably the game that took COD from a well known FPS to the dominant FPS. I loved it initially, but as I got older and replayed campaign, I have grown to somewhat dislike it. Now, this not really including multiplayer and spec ops, but I thought I would discuss it regardless. The over-the-top geopolitical situations in this game, and the suspension of disbelief you are required to entertain them, genuinely worsen the game.

To start:

1. No Russian remains an infamous COD mission and sits as probably the most notorious gaming level ever. Yet the situation is so insanely stupid. Firstly, *the Russian government doesn't investigate a mass killing to determine who is at fault*. Secondly, as a result they falsely assume the United States government, who have done shady shit in the past, would truly be that fucking dumb to organize and conduct this attack. Thirdly, the Russian's never investigate Makarov or his other cronies, who are very visible on cameras in an **international** airport, and instead just latch onto the one dead American who was found **shot outside of the airport**. They were never in the least bit suspicious why the only perpetrator who died was not even near where security or police were present in the airport?
2. The invasion of the US east coast in unfathomably dumb and only exists to give people some sort of fight or flight boner. It made cool scenery and such, but everything else about it is so dumb. Logistically, the Russian military has never had the capability to cross the ocean to invade the United States. Period. The game shows large Russian carrier planes flying over the US coast too. In what universe does Russia have enough transports to support such a deployment? Spoiler, definitely not a universe claiming to be about modern warfare. Most of their navy is subs and coastal boats, not large ocean faring ones that can transport their entire military to the eastern seaboard. This leads me to another point: **is the United States Navy, Air Force, and all the NATO affiliated counterparts blind to an invasion force crossing leaving Russia and then crossing the Atlantic?** It is the West's front yard, and easily the most heavily monitored sea-lane in the world. Even without satellites, radar, sonar, etc would catch all of that extremely early on. *Also*, why does Russia choose to invade the East Coast, the most populated and furthest coast from their ports, rather than the West Coast, which technically sits a few miles away via Alaska????? It's absurd.
3. Shepherd sucks as a villain, all because of his motivation. It boils down to, ""*I'm mad that I lost thousands of troops in the Middle East cause of a rogue nuke, so I am going to allow the murder of dozens of Russian civilians and then possibly millions of Americans in order to rouse people to be Patriots, all for my marines*."" Are you braindead, Shepherd? You have effectively crippled the United States, the nation you swore to protect, in order to somehow make it stronger??? You're retarded dude. Furthermore, by knowing the invasion was coming and not really doing anything about it, you're allowing the political group in control of Russia, THE ONES WHO REVERE THE GUY WHO DETONATED THAT NUKE KILLING YOUR MARINES, to effectively spit even more on their graves.

This is all. Let the downvotes proceed",2022-01-14 19:14:42

But at the same time how does getting 6 kills and 2 deaths until the game ends due to time bring you joy..  do you not get bored?  Literally every single death was too the three same guys in the lobby over and over again because they just didn‚Äôt want to leave their camping spots‚Ä¶ how is that fun?

Also the attachments do something different than what they would realistically do for example  the vertical foregrip it says ""reduces recoil."" When the point of a vertical foregrip is not to do that but it can be handy if recoil is an issue which on most 5.56x45MM firearms it's not . It's weird how it evolved backwards",2022-01-15 06:19:13

First of all, i do not play cod. But after seeing what happened to titanfall after the northstar client release, i thought that the cod community should make something like it too after seeing the misery of vanguard.

Basically some of you should develop a mod that allows people to host their own servers with their own rules, maps, guns etc. For example MW2 (or any cod out there) to shape the ultimate cod, made by the community.

Titanfall is still abandoned by the devs, but the community is holding it together, squeezing the best out of it.

CallOfDuty,2022,1,"We need to discuss this. Activision has actively taken steps to bring these teams to their knees by cutting QA testing and pushing forward awkward business models. But at the end of the day, a dev team has to make things work given their constraints.

Sledgehammer has dropped the ball twice now in back-to-back titles. WWII and Vanguard were both unfinished, broken disasters on launch that took months to repair. Their track record is horrible when they own the project. As a support studio, they do great work. I don‚Äôt understand why they‚Äôve been expanded to own an entire project and they need to be reduced back to being a support studio. On the other hand, Treyarch has essentially been reduced to a support studio due to Sledgehammer‚Äôs fuck ups, despite Treyarch having an excellent track record for their projects. 

Don‚Äôt even get me started on the dumpster fire that is Raven. They‚Äôve continuously made Warzone a bigger and bigger shitshow with every update. 4 new bugs appear for every bug they patch. Their integrations have almost always flopped. Gun balancing is in a horrible place. They‚Äôve even stated that they agree with how powerful the akimbo shotguns are right now. Raven has proven that they cannot manage Warzone time and time again. It seems like IW was the only one that could get it right. 

It‚Äôs time to cut these studios back. They tried and failed. This is absolutely ridiculous. Boycott the game! Don‚Äôt pre-order Sledgehammer-made titles! They don‚Äôt produce quality!",2022-01-15 20:22:32

CallOfDuty,2022,1,"I‚Äôve typically played CoD on PlayStation but bought Vanguard on Xbox because it was on sale.

Many years ago, I had an Activision account under an email that I made when I was like 7 years old, which has since been deleted

I‚Äôve been trying to get Activision to unlink my Xbox account from that account so that I can link it to my actual Activision account, but Activision refuses to unlink it because I am not emailing them from the account that it‚Äôs linked to.

I‚Äôve shown various proof that the email was deleted and even sent a copy of my passport and drivers licence to prove that the account is mine, and the address matches the one listed on my account.

For the past month they have said they are ‚Äúinvestigating it‚Äù but what the heck else could I possibly do to verify my identity?

Has anyone else here had this problem and has anyone actually successfully got them to change your email/unlink your account?",2022-01-16 00:38:26

CallOfDuty,2022,1,"So here we go.

The week of Christmas I hopped onto warzone for the first time since Modern Warfare. (In Modern Warfare had Everything...Damascus, Every completed battle pass, every challenge, store bought stuff.) My account was empty. I have only ever had 1 email and 1 activation account. The same account I have been playing on for Cold war and now Vanguard.

I hit 250+ in Vanguard by then, had a lot of store bought stuff on the account, Battle pass done, Diamond shotguns, a lot of play time. Activision decided to have me change my email for my account and recover my old Modern Warfare stuff.

They completed the recover of my Modern Warfare stuff, but in the process wiped the Vanguard/cold war off of the account like I never played them or bought anything. Now support is telling me that ""We recovered successfully I see no issue.""

This has been going on a month, I've given purchase screenshots of CoD points, screenshots of games, hell my clan I ran is still there. I have been told to clear my cache and temp files 4 times and that everything is fine.

Of course there is no number to call, or someone to talk to as an admin that actually knows what the hell they are doing. It's just email through a tier 1 tech that can do nothing and can't see any real information.

I just want to play the  game.

&amp;#x200B;

tl:dr I got my old Modern warfare information restored, because of that my Vanguard and Cold war information/purchases have all been wiped and support seems too do nothing but give me copy paste responses.",2022-01-16 06:48:54
